281,Monica,Look at me!
282,Monica,My big concern is what's real?!
283,Monica,Oh my God.
284,Monica,"We're really sad, aren't we?"
285,Phoebe,"Yeah, I think we are."
286,Monica,This isn't even my dress.
287,Phoebe,"Well, at least you didn't rent yours from a store called, ""It's Not Too Late."""
288,Monica,I'm changing out of this.
289,Phoebe,Me too.
290,Monica,In like a half-hour?
291,Phoebe,Me too.
292,Monica,"Okay, throw it straight this time."
293,Phoebe,Okay.
294,Monica,I'm getting married next!
295,Phoebe,Yay!
296,Phoebe,I hate my regular clothes now!
297,Phoebe,Y'know?
298,Phoebe,I look down and-and I know that this isn't gonna be the most special day of my life.
299,Monica,Yeah.
300,Monica,"I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn't you start feeling silly?"
301,Phoebe,I guess.
302,Phoebe,Oh my God!
303,Monica,Oh God.
304,Phoebe,"Oh, you're such a cheater!"
305,Chandler,Hello!
306,Chandler,Little ones.
307,Monica,Hey!
308,Phoebe,Hey!
309,Monica,"So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?"
310,Chandler,Yep!
311,Chandler,And!
312,Chandler,A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me.
313,Chandler,"Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me."
314,Phoebe,"Oh, how'd that happen?"
315,Chandler,Because I'm cooler.
316,Monica,"No, seriously."
317,Chandler,"Well she's, she's the kinda girlJoey was unconscious."
318,Joey,Hey you guys!
319,Joey,What's happening?
320,Monica,Oh my God!
321,Phoebe,What is that?
322,Joey,"Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it's gonna help me not to snore."
323,Monica,"Well, are you asleep right now, Joe?"
324,Monica,Cause I don't think you have to wear it unless you are!
325,Joey,I know I don't have too!
326,Joey,It tastes good.
327,Chandler,"Plus, you look cool."
328,Rachel,"Well, I just called Joshua"
329,Phoebe,"Oh, how did it go?"
330,Rachel,"Well, I did my best to convince him that I'm not some crazy girl who is dying to get marriedI'm just going through a hard time."
331,Phoebe,What did he say?
332,Rachel,"Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding."
333,Rachel,Ugh.
334,Rachel,I feel blue.
335,Monica,"Ohh, sweetie!"
336,Monica,"Hey, I bet you anything that he's gonna call you again."
337,Rachel,"Yeah, maybe, but I don't think I even care."
338,Rachel,I don't think he's the one I'm sad about.
339,Rachel,"Y'know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don't think I'm handling it all that well."
340,Phoebe,"Yeah, maybe."
341,Rachel,And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
342,Phoebe,Any luck?
343,Rachel,"Well, yeah, y'know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again?"
344,Rachel,"I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again."
345,Monica,Again.
346,Monica,Y'know what?
347,Monica,I think we all did.
348,Ross,Hey!
349,Monica,Hey!
350,Ross,"So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay?"
351,Ross,"How about, Ernie's at 9 o'clock?"
352,Rachel,"Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three."
353,Ross,"Oh, see I-I don't know if we're gonna be hungry at three."
354,Rachel,Three people.
355,Rachel,Joshua's not gonna be there.
356,Ross,What happened?
357,Rachel,"Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me."
358,Ross,Noo.
359,Ross,Why?
360,Rachel,"Well, apparently he scares easy."
361,Ross,"Oh, Rachel, I'm-I'm sorry."
362,Rachel,It's okay.
363,Rachel,"Sometimes, things don't work out the way you'd thought they would."
364,Ross,Come here.
365,Rachel,"Oh, hey, don't you have to go pick up Emily?"
366,Ross,Yeah.
367,Rachel,Yeah.
368,Ross,You okay?
369,Rachel,Yeah!
370,Rachel,I got my girls.
371,Rachel,Ugh.
372,Phoebe,"Hey, y'know what might cheer you up?"
373,Rachel,What?
374,Rachel,"Y'know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood."
375,Monica,"Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time."
376,Monica,"Maybe someday, there will be."
377,Monica,Oh God!
378,Monica,He's gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!
379,Rachel,"Oh, okay!"
380,Monica,"No-no, Rachel, don't get it!"
381,Monica,He can't see us!
382,Phoebe,"No, yeah!"
383,Phoebe,The groom cannot see the bride!
384,Rachel,I'm not gonna marry Chandler!
385,Phoebe,Not after this!
