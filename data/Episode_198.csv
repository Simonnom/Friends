134,Ross,Come on.
135,Ross,Come on.
136,Monica,Chicken Kiev?
137,Ross,Um-hmm!
138,Ross,Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
139,Monica,"Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken."
140,Monica,"And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella."
141,Monica,But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella...
142,Monica,"So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!"
143,Ross,Yeah.
144,Ross,Yeah.
145,Ross,"Yes, this place is beautiful."
146,Ross,Emily's parents got married here.
147,Monica,It's nice.
148,Ross,It's all right!
149,Ross,Everything's gonna be all right.
150,Ross,"Uh-huh, I see that."
151,Monica,"Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened."
152,Ross,What?
153,Ross,What?
154,Monica,They tore it down a few days early.
155,Joey,All right!
156,Joey,Westminster Abbey!
157,Joey,"Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen."
158,Joey,Hey!
159,Joey,Okay.
160,Joey,"What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?"
161,Chandler,I think it's great.
162,Chandler,It's great.
163,Chandler,"Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place."
164,Joey,Really?
165,Joey,To what?
166,Chandler,To Put the Camera Away!!
167,Joey,"Man, you are Westminster Crabby."
168,Monica,Don't worry.
169,Monica,You'll find some place to get married.
170,Monica,Oowww!
171,Monica,You're gonna find a place.
172,Monica,But even if - God forbid - you didn't..
173,Monica,So you postpone the wedding.
174,Monica,Is that really so bad?
175,Monica,"I mean, think about it."
176,Monica,You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want.
177,Monica,"You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm..."
178,Monica,Salmon!
179,Monica,"But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's gonna like you better than me."
180,Monica,"Oh, god... She's told you that already, didn't she?"
181,Phoebe,Oh.
182,Phoebe,Oh.
183,Rachel,"Oh, honey!"
184,Rachel,Don't get up!
185,Rachel,What do you need?
186,Phoebe,"Oh, no."
187,Phoebe,"Oh, nothing."
188,Rachel,Come on!
189,Rachel,I am here to take care of you!
190,Rachel,What do you need?
191,Rachel,Anything.
192,Phoebe,"Okay, I have a wedgie."
193,Rachel,"Okay, that is all you."
194,Phoebe,"So-so, what do you want for lunch?"
195,Rachel,"Oh, I don't know."
196,Rachel,I guess we have to eat.
197,Phoebe,"Yeah, I do."
198,Phoebe,What's the matter?
199,Rachel,I'm just bummed about the way I left things with Ross.
200,Rachel,I shouldn't have lied to him about having to work.
201,Rachel,He seemed so mad at me.
202,Phoebe,"Eh, don't be so hard on yourself."
203,Phoebe,If someone I was still in love with was getting married...
204,Rachel,Still in love with?
205,Phoebe,Yeah!
206,Rachel,I'm not in love with Ross!
207,Phoebe,Oh.
208,Phoebe,No.
209,Phoebe,No.
210,Phoebe,Good!
211,Phoebe,"Yeah, me neither."
212,Rachel,"Phoebe, I'm going to Ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable."
213,Rachel,"Not because, I'm still in love with him!"
214,Rachel,"I mean, hey, y'know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y'know?"
215,Rachel,"Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love!"
216,Rachel,"I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross."
217,Rachel,Yeah!
218,Rachel,"But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that I'm still in love with him."
219,Rachel,Y'know?
220,Rachel,"I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him-Ohh!"
221,Rachel,Oh my God!
222,Rachel,Oh my-why didn't you tell me?!
223,Phoebe,We thought you knew!
224,Rachel,We?
225,Phoebe,"Yeah, we all know!"
226,Phoebe,We talk about it all the time!
227,Rachel,You all know?
228,Rachel,Does Ross know?
229,Phoebe,"Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything."
230,Rachel,"Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!"
231,Phoebe,"Well, because we thought you knew!!"
232,Phoebe,It's so obvious!
233,Phoebe,"God, that would be like telling Monica, ""Hey, you like things clean."""
234,Phoebe,"Or, y'know, ""Hey, Joey, you're gay."""
235,Rachel,What?
236,Phoebe,"Oh, please!"
237,Phoebe,She's always got a broom in her hand!
238,Joey,Hey!
239,Joey,The
240,Joey,Check this out?
241,Joey,Huh?
242,Joey,Yeah.
243,Joey,That's the stuff.
244,Joey,What do you think?
245,Chandler,"Well, I don't have to buy that, ""I'm with stupid"" T-shirt anymore."
246,Joey,"Well, I like it."
247,Joey,Here you go.
248,Chandler,"All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you?"
249,Chandler,Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
250,Joey,"Oh, I embarrass you?"
251,Chandler,How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
252,Chandler,The
253,Chandler,Oh really?
254,Chandler,Then how come no one here is wearing them?
255,Chandler,The
256,Chandler,"All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself."
257,Joey,Oh yeah?
258,Joey,If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat?
259,Joey,I choose the hat.
260,Joey,The
261,Joey,Thanks.
262,Chandler,"Okay, wait."
263,Chandler,"All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here."
264,Chandler,I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
265,Joey,How you doin'?
266,Joey,"Joey Tribbiani, America."
267,Ross,Hey!
268,Ross,"I just spoke to your dad, and you know what?"
269,Ross,He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
270,Ross,Whoa-whoa-what?
271,Ross,You found a place?
272,Ross,She said what?
273,Ross,Postpone it?
274,Ross,"Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding?"
275,Ross,"Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?"
276,Ross,This isn't right.
277,Ross,I can't ask people to do that?
278,Ross,Would you ask people to do that?
279,Ross,The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option.
280,Ross,This is when we're getting married.
281,Ross,No.
282,Ross,I'm saying it's now.
283,Ross,There's no 'or' in mind.
284,Ross,What is wrong with these pants?!
285,Ross,"No, wait!"
286,Ross,Emily!
287,Ross,"No, wait, stop!"
288,Ross,"Emily, please- Commercial Break"
289,Phoebe,Hey!
290,Rachel,Hi.
291,Phoebe,"So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?"
292,Rachel,Manhattan does not have enough stores.
293,Phoebe,"Well, I think I can help you get over him."
294,Rachel,You can?
295,Phoebe,Yeah.
296,Phoebe,I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
297,Rachel,Um-hmm.
298,Phoebe,And a small piece of chocolate.
299,Rachel,Okay.
300,Phoebe,And a glass of tepid water.
301,Rachel,"Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?"
302,Phoebe,"Uh, only if you have the hiccups too."
303,Phoebe,"Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me."
304,Phoebe,I just didn't feel like getting up.
305,Phoebe,"Okay, I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross."
306,Phoebe,Okay?
307,Phoebe,And you're going to remember all of the bad things about him.
308,Phoebe,All right?
309,Phoebe,Really focus on his flaws.
310,Rachel,I can do that.
311,Rachel,I certainly did it when we were going out.
312,Phoebe,Okay.
313,Phoebe,"Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he's such a great guy."
314,Phoebe,Here.
315,Phoebe,"Okay, now, close your eyes."
316,Phoebe,And imagine that you're with Ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him.
317,Phoebe,And you're-you're running your hands all over his body.
318,Phoebe,"And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it's-uck!"
319,Phoebe,Hah?
320,Rachel,"I don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy."
321,Phoebe,"Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought."
322,Phoebe,"Umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy."
323,Rachel,Okay.
324,Phoebe,Okay?
325,Rachel,All right.
326,Phoebe,"So uh, now look at the picture..."
327,Rachel,Okay.
328,Phoebe,"All right, and umm..."
329,Rachel,Ow!
330,Phoebe,"Okay, how do you feel now?"
331,Rachel,"Well, I like you less!"
332,Chandler,"Well, this is just as boring in England."
333,Joey,Hey.
334,Chandler,Hey.
335,Joey,Oh.
336,Joey,Sorry!
337,Chandler,"No-no-no, y'know what?"
338,Chandler,"I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool."
339,Chandler,"And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day."
340,Joey,Me too.
341,Chandler,Yeah?
342,Joey,Noo!!
343,Joey,I've had the best day ever!
344,Joey,"Dude, check this out!"
345,Joey,"Now, I'm gonna fastforward past the part with you, 'cause it is boring."
346,Monica,Hey!
347,Joey,Sh-shh-shh!
348,Joey,"Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat."
349,Joey,"Oh, Chandler."
350,Chandler,That's... That's was...
351,Monica,Oh my God!
352,Joey,That's Fergie baby!
353,Joey,"So, I hear you're single now..."
354,Chandler,How did you?
355,Chandler,How?
356,Chandler,How?
357,Joey,"Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right?"
358,Joey,"So, I'm in my map and-and... Hey!"
359,Monica,Hey!
360,Ross,Hi.
361,Ross,I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
362,Monica,"Yes, I did!"
363,Monica,And you are welcome!
364,Ross,Am I?!
365,Ross,And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?
366,Monica,Umm...
367,Chandler,I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
368,Joey,Wait up!
369,Ross,"Hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?"
370,Monica,She said that?
371,Ross,Yeah.
372,Monica,Why?
373,Ross,"I don't know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out."
374,Monica,Oh my God.
375,Monica,You're even dumber than I am!
376,Ross,Excuse me?
377,Monica,"Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?"
378,Ross,I don't know.
379,Ross,A month?
380,Monica,Emily has probably been planning it since she was five!
381,Monica,Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head.
382,Monica,That's what we did!
383,Monica,"We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top."
384,Monica,Thanks.
385,Monica,But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
386,Ross,I had no idea.
387,Ross,"And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun."
388,Monica,Sometimes we were.
389,Ross,Come on.
390,Ross,You gotta help me figure out what to do.
391,Ross,Okay?
392,Monica,Okay.
393,Ross,Come on.
394,Chandler,That was pretty intense huh?
395,Joey,Yeah.
396,Joey,"Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!"
397,Chandler,I hope he did!
398,Phoebe,Ooh!
399,Phoebe,I thought of a good flaw!
400,Phoebe,Ross pops his gum!
401,Rachel,"Oh, right!"
402,Rachel,"Wait a minute, I do that too."
403,Phoebe,"Yeah, I know."
404,Phoebe,It drives me crazy.
405,Phoebe,I'll get it.
406,Phoebe,Hello.
407,Joey,"Hey, Pheebs!"
408,Joey,It's Joey!
409,Phoebe,"Hey, Joey!"
410,Phoebe,Hey!
411,Phoebe,Ooh!
412,Phoebe,Ooh!
413,Phoebe,I just say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway.
414,Phoebe,And I was gonna go over and say 'hi!'
415,Phoebe,"but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you."
416,Joey,That just cost me four bucks.
417,Joey,"But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?"
418,Phoebe,"Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe!"
419,Phoebe,Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all.
420,Phoebe,"So, do you miss me?"
421,Joey,"Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun."
422,Phoebe,So you're not homesick yet?
423,Joey,"No, I don't think so."
424,Phoebe,"All right, the seven of us miss you."
425,Joey,Who's seven?
426,Phoebe,"Y'know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies..."
427,Joey,"Ahh, the babies miss me?"
428,Phoebe,Of course they do!
429,Phoebe,Or I'm just really hungry.
430,Phoebe,"Ooh, the pizza guy's here!"
431,Joey,What?
432,Joey,You ordered pizza without me?
433,Phoebe,Yeah.
434,Phoebe,"But y'know we were thinking about you, y'know we ordered the Joey Special."
435,Joey,Two pizzas?
436,Phoebe,Yep!
437,Phoebe,"Okay, gotta go, talk to you later."
438,Joey,"Wait, well, where did you get it from?"
439,Monica,You'll see.
440,Ross,Okay?
441,Ross,"But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay?"
442,Ross,"And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles..."
443,Monica,"And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay?"
444,Monica,"And the chairs can face this way , and...  You go."
445,Ross,"But-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time."
446,Ross,"Really, it's fine, whatever you want."
447,Ross,"And, I don't know, if it starts to rain..."
448,Monica,Ohh.
449,Monica,And I don't even have a date.
450,Rachel,Pheebs?
451,Phoebe,Yeah?
452,Rachel,Do you remember where the duck food is?
453,Phoebe,"Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink."
454,Phoebe,Why?
455,Rachel,Because I'm going to London.
456,Phoebe,What?!
457,Phoebe,What do you mean you're going to London?
458,Rachel,"Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him."
459,Rachel,"Now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies until I get back."
460,Phoebe,"But what about all the ""finding-his-flaws"" stuff we've been doing?"
461,Rachel,"Yeah, that didn't work."
462,Phoebe,"I-Rachel, you can't go!"
463,Phoebe,Ross loves Emily!
464,Rachel,"Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does."
465,Rachel,But I have to tell him how I feel!
466,Rachel,He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
467,Phoebe,That's not why you're going!
468,Phoebe,"You're going because you hope he's gonna say, ""Yeah, I love you too, Rach."
469,Phoebe,"Forget that British chippy."""
470,Rachel,Ohh-Do you think he will?
471,Phoebe,No!
472,Phoebe,Because he's in love with the British chippy!
473,Phoebe,"Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding!"
474,Phoebe,"Y'know, it's too late!"
475,Phoebe,You missed you're chance!
476,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over."
477,Rachel,Y'know what?
478,Rachel,No.
479,Rachel,"It's not over until someone says, ""I do."""
480,Phoebe,I do!
481,Phoebe,I do!
482,Phoebe,I do!
483,Phoebe,I do!
484,Phoebe,"Ugh, like I can really chase you."

919,Monica,"Joey, what are you doing?"
920,Monica,You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
921,Joey,"Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count."
922,Monica,That's true.
923,Chandler,The man's got a point.
924,Rachel,"Oh, hi!"
925,Ross,Hi!
926,Rachel,Hi.
927,Rachel,"Sorry, things aren't working out so well."
928,Ross,Oh no!
929,Ross,"It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right?"
930,Rachel,Oh yeah!
931,Rachel,"Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know?"
932,Rachel,"I mean, so you said my name!"
933,Rachel,"Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, ""I take thee circus freak."""
934,Rachel,"Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake."
935,Rachel,It didn't mean anything.
936,Rachel,Right?
937,Ross,No!
938,Ross,No!
939,Ross,Of course it didn't mean anything!
940,Ross,"I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you..."
941,Rachel,Right...
942,Ross,But it absolutely didn't.
943,Ross,It didn't!!
944,Ross,It didn't!
945,Joey,"Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so..."
946,Ross,Oh!
947,Ross,"Oh-oh, the band's ready!"
948,Ross,"Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says-I don't care about the stupid band!"
949,Joey,You spit on me man!
950,Ross,"Look, I'm sorry."
951,Joey,"Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?"
952,Rachel,"Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame."
953,Ross,"Oh, right!"
954,Rachel,"Get the hell out of there, y'know?"
955,Ross,Emily?
956,Ross,Emily?
957,Ross,I'm coming in.
958,Rachel,"Well, look at that, same thing."
959,Chandler,"Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, ""Yippee!"""
960,Chandler,just ignore me.
961,Monica,"Oh my God, Rachel!"
962,Monica,Hi!
963,Chandler,"Oh, hello Rachel."

967,Monica,How did you get in here?
968,Rachel,"If anybody asks, I'm your sister, Joan."
969,Rachel,Listen.
970,Rachel,"C'mon, you guys."
971,Rachel,Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!
972,Chandler,Your sister Joan is crazy.
973,Rachel,Y'know what?
974,Rachel,"Fine, I don't care."
975,Rachel,"Don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?"
976,Chandler,"Yes, we do."
977,Chandler,"But, we have to change first."
978,Monica,"Yes, I want to change."
979,Monica,And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
980,Chandler,"Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes."
981,Monica,Fifteen minutes.
982,Rachel,Okay.
983,Rachel,Hello?
984,Rachel,"Oh, Pheebs!"
985,Rachel,It's Phoebe!
986,Chandler,"Oh, yay..."
987,Monica,Great...
988,Rachel,Hi!
989,Phoebe,"Hi, so what happened?"
990,Rachel,"Well, Ross said my name."
991,Phoebe,"Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything."
992,Rachel,"Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right?"
993,Rachel,"Ninth grade, right?"
994,Rachel,The obsession starts.
995,Rachel,All right?
996,Rachel,"The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow."
997,Rachel,So then...
998,Chandler,"Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?"
999,Monica,But my clothes are-ohh!
1000,Chandler,"Wow, you look..."
1001,Monica,No time for that!
1002,Joey,"Hey, dude, let me in."
1003,Joey,I got a girl out here!
1004,Chandler,"Well, I've got a girl in here."
1005,Joey,"No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!"
1006,Chandler,"Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!"
1007,Joey,"Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?"
1008,Chandler,"Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!!"
1009,Chandler,"But, what if we're watching a movie in here?"
1010,Monica,"Which we are, and-and we already paid for it."
1011,Monica,It's My Giant!
1012,Joey,My Giant?
1013,Joey,I love that movie!
1014,Monica,You really think this is okay?
1015,Chandler,"Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it."
1016,Monica,"Oh, it's so beautiful."
1017,Monica,Ohh!
1018,Monica,"Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this."
1019,Chandler,"Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite."
1020,Chandler,The room expects sex.
1021,Chandler,The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex.
1022,Chandler,All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
1023,Monica,Okay!
1024,Chandler,Okay!
1025,Ross,Emily?
1026,Chandler,"Nope, not under here!"
1027,Monica,You didn't find her?
1028,Ross,"No, I've looked everywhere!"
1029,Chandler,"Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!"
1030,Monica,"Yeah, I think you should keep looking!"
1031,Chandler,"Yeah, for about 30 minutes."
1032,Monica,Or 45.
1033,Chandler,"Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice."
1034,Ross,No!
1035,Ross,"For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around."
1036,Ross,"No, from now on, I'm staying in one place."
1037,Ross,Right here.
1038,Monica,"Well, it's getting late."
1039,Chandler,"Yeah, we're gonna go."
1040,Ross,"Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?"
1041,Monica,"Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York."
1042,Chandler,"Yeah, it's a very large plane."
1043,Ross,That's cool.
1044,Chandler,"But, we'll stay here with you."
1045,Ross,Thanks guys!
1046,Ross,"I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt."
1047,Ross,Commercial Break
1048,Chandler,We have to leave for New York in an hour.
1049,Monica,"I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?"
1050,Chandler,We can't do that that's insane.
1051,Chandler,"I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it."
1052,Ross,Em-Emily?
1053,Ross,Em-Emily?
1054,Ross,Emily!
1055,Ross,Mr.
1056,Ross,"Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?"
1057,Ross,Mr.
1058,Rachel,"Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside...   Mr."
1059,Ross,"Now, hold on!"
1060,Ross,Hold on!
1061,Ross,"Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too!"
1062,Ross,"Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay?"
1063,Ross,She's-she's just a friend and that's all!
1064,Ross,That's all!
1065,Ross,Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else.
1066,Ross,"Please, promise me that you'll tell her that."
1067,Ross,Mr.
1068,Monica,"Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again."
1069,Chandler,"Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special."
1070,Chandler,"Y'know, technically we still are over international waters."
1071,Monica,"I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?"
1072,Chandler,'Kay!
1073,Joey,Can I ask you something?
1074,Chandler,"Uhh, no."
1075,Joey,"Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, ""I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant."""
1076,Joey,Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
1077,Chandler,No.
1078,Joey,"I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?"
1079,Chandler,Yes.
1080,Joey,Thanks man.
1081,Chandler,Okay man.
1082,Joey,But what about how much taller he is than me?
1083,Joey,"I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know?"
1084,Joey,"And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?"
1085,Joey,"Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour."
1086,Monica,I know!
1087,Joey,"Had the beef-tips, huh?"
1088,Ross,Rach!
1089,Ross,Rach!
1090,Rachel,Hi!
1091,Ross,Hi!
1092,Ross,"What are you, what are you doing here?"
1093,Rachel,"Well, I-I-I've been on Standby for a flight home for hours."
1094,Ross,Oh.
1095,Rachel,"Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?"
1096,Ross,Not yet.
1097,Rachel,"So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?"
1098,Rachel,Gate
1099,Ross,Pretty soon I guess.
1100,Rachel,Yeah.
1101,Rachel,I'm sorry.
1102,Ross,"I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this?"
1103,Ross,"Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?"
1104,Rachel,"No, you're not an idiot, Ross."
1105,Rachel,You're a guy very much in love.
1106,Ross,Same difference.
1107,Ross,Gate
1108,Ross,I get it!
1109,Ross,"Well, that's that."
1110,Rachel,"No, you know what, I think you should go."
1111,Ross,What?
1112,Rachel,"Yeah, I do."
1113,Rachel,"I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good."
1114,Ross,"Oh, I don't, I don't, I don't know..."
1115,Rachel,"Oh, come on Ross!"
1116,Rachel,I think it would be really good for you!
1117,Ross,"I could, yeah, I can do that."
1118,Rachel,Yeah.
1119,Ross,"I can't, I can't even believe her!"
1120,Ross,"No, y'know what, I am, I am gonna go!"
1121,Rachel,Good!
1122,Ross,"I know, why not?"
1123,Rachel,Right!
1124,Ross,Right?
1125,Rachel,Right!
1126,Ross,Y'know-thanks!
1127,Rachel,"Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here."
1128,Ross,"Yeah, well...nah."
1129,Rachel,What?
1130,Rachel,"Wait, what?"
1131,Ross,"Why don't you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?"
1132,Rachel,"Well-well, I don't know Ross-really?"
1133,Ross,"Yeah, yeah, it'll be great!"
1134,Ross,"You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage."
1135,Ross,See-see how I make jokes?
1136,Rachel,Uh-huh.
1137,Ross,"No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend."
1138,Rachel,"Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe."
1139,Rachel,"Umm, yes, I can do that!"
1140,Ross,Okay!
1141,Rachel,Okay!
1142,Ross,Cool!
1143,Rachel,All right!
1144,Ross,Come on!
1145,Ross,Here.
1146,Rachel,"Oh, okay, we're going."
1147,Rachel,Yeah.
1148,Ross,Ah!
1149,Ross,Ah!
1150,Ross,I forgot my jacket!
1151,Rachel,"Oh, wait-wait-wait..."
1152,Ross,You tell them to wait!
1153,Rachel,Okay.
1154,Rachel,Wait!
1155,Rachel,Wait!
1156,Ross,Emily.
1157,Ross,Oh no-no-no!
1158,Ross,Oh-no!
1159,Ross,No!
1160,Ross,No!

1162,Ross,Commercial Break
1163,Rachel,"Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot   Air"
1164,Rachel,"And uh,  he will have a white wine spritzer."
1165,Rachel,Air
1166,Rachel,All right.
1167,Rachel,Woo!
1168,Rachel,"Hey, look at that, the airport's moving."
1169,Rachel,"Hey, are we moving?!"
1170,Rachel,Are we moving?
1171,Rachel,Why are we moving?
1172,Rachel,They said they were gonna wait!
1173,Rachel,Miss?
1174,Rachel,"Yeah, does the captain know that we're moving?"
1175,Rachel,"Oh my... Ross, you better be under the wheels of this thing!"
1176,Phoebe,Hey!
1177,Chandler,Hey!
1178,Joey,Hi!
1179,Phoebe,You ate meat!
1180,Phoebe,You had sex!
1181,Chandler,No we didn't!
1182,Phoebe,"I know you didn't, I was talking about Monica."
1183,Monica,"Phoebe, I did not have sex."
1184,Phoebe,This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
1185,Joey,"All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck."
1186,Phoebe,"Oh, me too!"
1187,Joey,"Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?"
1188,Phoebe,"Oh right, maybe I'll just go home."
1189,Monica,"Well, we certainly are alone."
1190,Chandler,Yes!
1191,Chandler,"Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule."
1192,Monica,Right.
1193,Monica,"Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother..."
1194,Chandler,Right.
1195,Monica,"Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks."
1196,Chandler,Oh.
1197,Chandler,"Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot!"
1198,Chandler,Is that okay?
1199,Monica,That's okay.
1200,Chandler,And I'm cute too.
1201,Monica,And you're cute too.
1202,Chandler,Thank you!
1203,Chandler,"All right, I gotta go unpack."
1204,Monica,Okay.
1205,Chandler,Bye.

1209,Chandler,End
