46,Rachel,"Wow, he's cute, Pheebs!"
47,Rachel,But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.
48,Phoebe,"Oh, Jason?"
49,Phoebe,"Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight."
50,Rachel,What-Pheebs?!
51,Rachel,Two dates in one day?
52,Rachel,That's so unlike you.
53,Phoebe,"I know, I know!"
54,Phoebe,I'm like playing the field.
55,Phoebe,Y'know?
56,Phoebe,"Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats."
57,Phoebe,Y'know?
58,Phoebe,"Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler."

62,Ross,Hey guys!
63,Joey,Hey.
64,Rachel,Hi!
65,Joey,Well?
66,Chandler,"Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?"
67,Ross,"Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign."
68,Joey,Well what is it?
69,Ross,He couldn't even tell me!
70,Ross,He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality.
71,Ross,"And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it."
72,Chandler,Y'know what?
73,Chandler,"You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple."
74,Chandler,He just lopped it right off.
75,Chandler,Y'know?
76,Chandler,So I guess I'm lucky.
77,Chandler,I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
78,Ross,At least they knew what yours was.
79,Ross,"Y'know, yours had a name."
80,Joey,Oh!
81,Joey,Maybe they'll name yours after you!
82,Joey,"Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross."
83,Joey,"And then people would be like, ""Awww, he's got a Ross."""
84,Ross,"Yeah, that'd be cool!"
85,Monica,Pete's breaking up with me.
86,Monica,"I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk."
87,Rachel,And?
88,Monica,Well that's it.
89,Monica,People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.
90,Joey,"Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you."
91,Monica,Really?
92,Joey,"Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you."
93,Phoebe,That is so great!
94,Phoebe,"Oh, I...  Oh my God!"
95,Phoebe,Oh my God!!
96,Phoebe,No!
97,Phoebe,No!
98,Phoebe,"Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic."
99,Phoebe,"Oh my God, here they come!"
100,Phoebe,"Well, we gotta get out of here!"
101,Phoebe,"Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one."
102,Phoebe,Okay?
103,Ross,"Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple."
104,Ross,Y'know?
105,Ross,Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple.
106,Ross,Y'know?
107,Ross,You can take it off.
108,Ross,Just slice that baby right off!
109,Ross,Dr.
110,Ross,Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
111,Ross,Dr.

113,Ross,Dr.
114,Ross,"Well then, what is it?!"
115,Ross,Dr.
116,Monica,I gotta go water Pete's plants.
117,Monica,"Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants."
118,Chandler,"Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants."
119,Chandler,If y'know what I mean.
120,Joey,"Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them."
121,Phoebe,and I-I can't take it!
122,Phoebe,Y'know?
123,Phoebe,"I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one."
124,Phoebe,It's making me crazy.
125,Rachel,"Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?"
126,Phoebe,Uh.
127,Joey,Whoa-whoa-whoa.
128,Joey,"What ah, what happened to playing the field?"
129,Phoebe,"Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work."
130,Phoebe,It's like I'm working in the field.
131,Rachel,"So Pheebs, pick one of them."
132,Monica,Yeah.
133,Monica,Which one do you like more?
134,Phoebe,"Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy."
135,Phoebe,Y'know?
136,Phoebe,"He's so burly, he's sooo very burly."
137,Joey,"Okay, good, so there you go."
138,Joey,Go with Vince.
139,Phoebe,"Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive."
140,Chandler,"Well sensitive is important, pick him."
141,Phoebe,Yeah.
142,Joey,"Oh sure, go with the sissy."

202,Rachel,"And ah, you could start with a money salad!"
203,Rachel,"I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it."
204,Monica,Would you stop?
205,Monica,"We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose."

207,Chandler,Okay?
208,Chandler,"He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome."
209,Chandler,For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing.

221,Phoebe,"Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know?"
222,Phoebe,"But, it's just Jason's so sensitive, y'know?"
223,Phoebe,"And in the long run, I think sensitive it's just better than having just like a really, really, really nice  butt."
224,Phoebe,Jason!
225,Phoebe,Definitely Jason!
226,Phoebe,"Okay, wish me luck!"
227,Rachel,OH MY GOD!!!

229,Phoebe,Excuse me.
230,Phoebe,"Umm, is Vince here?"
231,Phoebe,Wow!
232,Phoebe,I didn't know you guys actually used those.
233,Phoebe,"Umm, wow."
234,Phoebe,This-this isn't gonna be easy.
235,Phoebe,"Umm, I don't think we should see each other anymore."
236,Phoebe,I'm sorry.
237,Phoebe,"Oh my God, I didn't"
238,Phoebe,Wait-wait-wait!
239,Phoebe,Wait!
240,Phoebe,"I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy."
241,Ross,"Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs."
242,Ross,I don't want to make it savory.
243,Monica,"Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it."
244,Ross,Gimme this.
245,Rachel,Hi!
246,Rachel,"Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist."
247,Monica,Brides magazines?
248,Rachel,"Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin."
249,Phoebe,"Oh, you so would!"
250,Phoebe,"Oh, you should get that anyway."
251,Phoebe,Like for clubbing.
252,Monica,"It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes."
253,Monica,"I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't."
254,Monica,Right?
255,Monica,"I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy."
256,Rachel,Oh my God.
257,Monica,I know.
258,Monica,I need more pie.
259,Phoebe,"Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?"
260,Rachel,You didn't break up with that fireman?
261,Phoebe,"No, that was my way of telling you."
262,Phoebe,"Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints."
263,Phoebe,He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
264,Rachel,Wow!
265,Phoebe,"Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal."
266,Monica,"So then, are you going to dump Jason?"
267,Phoebe,"Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and Okay so Jason is sensitive,  but now so's Vince  Plus, Vince has the body y'know?"
268,Phoebe,So It's really just about the math.
269,Phoebe,Jason?
270,Phoebe,Nah-ha!
271,Ross,Hi.

300,Monica,Okay.
301,Monica,You wanna what?
302,Monica,What are you talking about?
303,Monica,And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
304,Monica,My parents will be so happy.
305,Phoebe,"Crazy underwear, creepin' up my butt."
306,Phoebe,"Crazy underwear, always in a rut."
307,Phoebe,Crazy under--wear  Oh No!
308,Phoebe,What is he doing here?
309,Phoebe,"All right, just keep playing, just keep playing."

317,Phoebe,"Yeah, okay, I've-I've been dating both of you, and it's been really horrible."
318,Phoebe,"Cause y'know it's been a lot of fun, for me."
319,Phoebe,"Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn't know how to chose, so..."
320,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm terrible, I'm a terrible person."
321,Phoebe,I'm terrible.
322,Phoebe,Really?
323,Phoebe,"Well, this is none of my business."
324,Phoebe,"Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park."
325,Phoebe,"Well, that could've been really awkward."
326,Phoebe,"Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I'm gonna do that for you."
327,Chandler,Everything's gonna be all right.
328,Chandler,"Okay, Dick?"
329,Chandler,Guru
330,Joey,"Yeah, yeah."
