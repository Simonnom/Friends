131,Rachel,This isn't funny!
132,Rachel,Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
133,Rachel,Yes I did!
134,Rachel,"And I put a little Post-It on it that said, ""Must go out today,"" and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn't want to seem to bossy."
135,Rachel,"Y'know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk."
136,Rachel,Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
137,Rachel,No!

148,Ross,"Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay?"
149,Ross,"Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle."
150,Ross,"So, when you get down thereyou go up to the roof and you let me in."
151,Joey,Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute!
152,Joey,I have to do it?
153,Ross,Yeah!
154,Ross,"Oh yeah, you'll be fine!"
155,Ross,"It-it'll be uh, just like bungy jumping."
156,Ross,Y'know?
157,Ross,But instead of bouncing back up you-you won't.
158,Joey,What if I smack my head on the concrete?
159,Ross,"Well, I'm gonna lie to you Joey, it's a possibility."
160,Joey,I don't know Ross!
161,Joey,"I-I tell you what, let's flip to see who does it, okay?"

180,Joey,"Well all right so, it looks like we're even!"
181,Phoebe,Okay.
182,Phoebe,"So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here."
183,Phoebe,"Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do  Well done, Pheebs."
