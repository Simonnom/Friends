0,Phoebe,Hey!
1,Phoebe,"New wallet, huh?"
2,Chandler,"Yeah, it was time."
3,Chandler,The old condom ring in the leather just doesn't say cool' anymore.
4,Monica,Rachel!
5,Rachel,What?
6,Monica,You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
7,Rachel,"Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full."
8,Monica,Have you ever taken out the trash?
9,Rachel,"Well, I thought you liked doing it."
10,Monica,Third door on the left.
11,Rachel,Right!
12,Rachel,Oh!
13,Rachel,"Hey, Mr. Treeger."
14,Rachel,Mr.
15,Rachel,Ummm.
16,Rachel,Oh!
17,Rachel,I'm sorry.
18,Rachel,It's a little old but Mr.
19,Rachel,I'm sorry.
20,Rachel,I didn'tI don't come in here a lot.
21,Rachel,Mr.
22,Rachel,No.
23,Rachel,Mr.
24,Rachel,I didn't I never said that.
25,Rachel,Mr.
26,Rachel,"Okay, I'm sorry."
27,Monica,God!
28,Monica,If you're gonna cry about it!
29,Monica,(She grabs the box and goes to through it out.]
30,Monica,Opening Credits
31,Joey,"Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?"
32,Rachel,Yes!
33,Rachel,And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
34,Joey,I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
35,Monica,"Joey, please don't do that."
36,Monica,I think it's best that we just forget about it.
37,Rachel,"That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed."
38,Joey,"All right that's it, school is in session!"
39,Monica,My God!
40,Monica,Is this a gym card?
41,Chandler,"Oh yeah, gym member."
42,Chandler,"I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times."
43,Ross,So why don't you quit?
44,Chandler,You don't think I've tried?
45,Chandler,You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month?
46,Chandler,"No, they make you go all the way down there!"
47,Chandler,Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you!
48,Chandler,Then they bring out Maria.
49,Ross,Who is Maria?
50,Chandler,Oh Maria.
51,Chandler,"You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gymtreat."
52,Ross,You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
53,Chandler,No!
54,Ross,So you're strong enough to face her on your own?
55,Chandler,"Oh no, you'll have to come."
56,Joey,Hey!
57,Joey,You hold on pal!
58,Joey,"Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry."
59,Joey,"So now, you're gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord."
60,Joey,Mr.
61,Joey,"Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry."
62,Joey,Mr.
63,Joey,I have actually not heard of that.
64,Joey,Mr.
65,Joey,Why don't you tell me something I don't know!
66,Phoebe,"Oh please, somebody tell me I don't have to go to work today!"
67,Monica,What's the matter?
68,Phoebe,"Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I'm not allowed to charge for."
69,Monica,So do them for free.
70,Phoebe,"Oh no, it is forbidden!"
71,Phoebe,"No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients."
72,Phoebe,And it's against my oath as a masseuse.
73,Ross,They make you take an oath?
74,Phoebe,"No, I made myself take an oath."
75,Phoebe,"Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared."
76,Phoebe,"Yeah, that one's actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense."
77,Chandler,Why don't you just give him to somebody else?
78,Phoebe,"No, I can handle it."
79,Phoebe,"No, I'm a professional."
80,Rachel,"Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?"
81,Monica,Wow!
82,Monica,And you got a petticure.
83,Monica,Your feet are all dressed up.
84,Chandler,Because that's the only part of you he can see when he's on the table!
85,Monica,You're gonna do some feet flirtin'!
86,Phoebe,I don't what your talking about.
87,Ross,Then how do you explain the toe ring?
88,Phoebe,Because it's Arabian princess day at work!
89,Phoebe,Okay?!
90,Phoebe,Leave me alone!
91,Rachel,Oh!
92,Rachel,My hero!
93,Rachel,What happened?
94,Joey,"Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he'd better come up here and apologize."
95,Joey,I'll see you later.
96,Monica,"What a minute, what did he say?"
97,Joey,"He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he's gonna do is have you evictedI'll see you later."
98,Rachel,What?!
99,Rachel,You got us evicted!
100,Monica,I told you not to go down there!
101,Joey,Well he made Rachel cry!
102,Monica,Rachel always cries!
103,Rachel,That's not true!
104,Monica,"Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him."
105,Monica,I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!
106,Joey,All right!
107,Joey,I'll try!
108,Joey,"But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled."
109,Rachel,Go!
110,Joey,"All right, all right, all right."
111,Joey,"I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it."
112,Ross,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey!"
113,Ross,"Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong."
114,Chandler,Yes.
115,Chandler,Yes!
116,Ross,"One more time, ""Hey, don't you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"""
117,Chandler,No!
118,Chandler,I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
119,Ross,Good!

161,Rachel,"Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?"
162,Joey,"Well, he's too shy, he doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet."
163,Rachel,"Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down thatgarbage chute."

172,Rachel,"Oh, umm, I was just y'know working out and umm Oh, that's it."
173,Chandler,We're doomed.
174,Chandler,"Okay, they're gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives."
175,Chandler,What are we gonna do?
176,Monica,"Well, you could actually go to the gym."
177,Ross,Or!
178,Ross,"Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source."
179,Chandler,You're a genius!
180,Joey,"Aww, man, now we won't be bank buddies!"
181,Chandler,"Now, there's two reasons."
182,Phoebe,Hey.
183,Phoebe,"Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about?"
184,Phoebe,I bit him.

186,Phoebe,On the touchy.
187,Ross,And that's not against your oath?
188,Phoebe,"No, I know!"
189,Phoebe,"I-I'm sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one."
190,Monica,"Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself."
