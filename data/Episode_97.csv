75,Phoebe,"I dunno, well he got over the ""We were on a break"" thing really quickly."
76,Rachel,"Y'know I can't even worry about that right now, cause I got the cutie little baby, oh I can't believe how much I love her, I can't get enough of her, like right now I miss her."

98,Phoebe,Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!
99,Monica,"Alright here's something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side."

117,Joey,"But I gotta say technically, I didn't even do anything wrong."
118,Ross,What!
119,Ross,You didn't do anything wrong?
120,Joey,I said I didn't technically.
121,Ross,"Okay let's put aside that you  ""accidentally"" picked up my grandmothers ring and you  ""accidentally"" proposed to Rachel."
122,Joey,"Look, can I just stop you right there for a second?"
123,Joey,When people do this  I don't really know what that means.
124,Joey,You were saying?
125,Ross,"And I can even understand that you couldn't tell Rachel, but why couldn't you tell me, huh?"
126,Ross,You had all day to and you didn't.

140,Joey,You'll feel better!
141,Joey,"I'll feel better, and you know you want to."

186,Monica,Okay what's up
187,Chandler,"Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year?"
188,Chandler,"You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?"
189,Monica,Oh yeah .
190,Chandler,"Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?"
191,Monica,What?
192,Monica,Who says that?
193,Chandler,People who've never ever been to Paris.
194,Monica,What's going on?
195,Chandler,We're moving to Tulsa!
196,Monica,Excuse me?
197,Chandler,"Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes."
198,Monica,"Tulsa, Oklahoma!"
199,Chandler,"The Sooner State, whatever that is."

204,Monica,"Are you trying to tell me that we're moving to Oklahoma, or that you're gay?"
205,Monica,"All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?"
206,Chandler,"No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus."
207,Chandler,I'll get out of it.
208,Monica,Thank you.
209,Chandler,What is wrong with Emma?
210,Monica,"Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa."
211,Chandler,"Umm ma'am, do you have a minute?"
212,Chandler,I kind of have some bad news.
213,Chandler,I don't think I can move to Tulsa.
214,Chandler,Ms.
215,Chandler,"It's a funny story, actually."
216,Chandler,"I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said I'd move to Tulsa, I didn't really know what I was saying."
217,Chandler,Ms.
218,Chandler,"But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ain't that funny?"
219,Chandler,Irony?
220,Chandler,"Not a fan, alright ."
221,Chandler,"See, here's the thing."
222,Chandler,I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won't go.
223,Chandler,"See, me, I love Tulsa!"

238,Joey,You sure you're punching right?
239,Joey,Make a fist.
240,Joey,Maybe later.
241,Joey,Ross I feel terrible.
242,Ross,"You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms."
243,Joey,"You, you want me to help you with that?"
244,Ross,"Why, does it look like I'm having trouble with my misshapen claw?"
245,Joey,Name?

263,Joey,But you two were supposed to be together.
264,Ross,"Well, I thought so too, but then she said she'd marry you."
265,Joey,"Come on, Ross, that didn't mean anything!"
266,Joey,"She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody."
267,Ross,Yeah that's what she said.
268,Joey,So?
269,Ross,So I don't wanna be just anybody.
270,Joey,Wow.
271,Ross,"You know what, it's, it's better this way anyway."
272,Ross,"I mean I don't know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us."
273,Ross,It's just much easier if we're just friends who have a kid.
274,Joey,Really?
275,Ross,Yeah.
276,Joey,And you're Okay with that?
277,Ross,Yes.
278,Ross,"I mean, it's what we always planned."
279,Ross,"And if you have a plan, you should stick to it."
280,Ross,That's why they call them plans.
281,Ross,Hello?
282,Ross,I'm fine.
