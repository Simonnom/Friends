19,Rachel,"Joey, it's just a chair!"
20,Rachel,What's the big deal?
21,Joey,The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any glare coming of off Stevie.
22,Rachel,Stevie the TV?
23,Joey,Is there a problem?

29,Ross,"Hey, y'know what's weird?"
30,Ross,"After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you're gonna have to say, ""This is my brother-in-law Ross."""
31,Ross,"Not, ""My friend Ross,"" ""brother-in-law Ross."""
32,Ross,That's weird isn't it?
33,Chandler,"Couldn't I just say, ""This is Ross?"""
34,Ross,"Sure, do whatever you want."
35,Monica,Hey Ross!
36,Monica,"So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section"
37,Ross,Yeah?
38,Monica,Look at this.
39,Ross,"Oh, it looks like mom and dad's house."
40,Ross,"Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic isOh my God!"
41,Phoebe,What?
42,Phoebe,What happened to the window in the attic?
43,Monica,I can't believe mom and dad are selling the house!
44,Ross,I can't believe they-they didn't even tell us!
45,Phoebe,I can't believe I still don't know what happened to the window in the attic!
46,Ross,"Uh, hello dad!"
47,Ross,Monica and I just saw the house in the paper!
48,Ross,Yes we're surprised!
49,Ross,Who did you leave a message with?
50,Chandler,Sorry!
51,Rachel,"Joey, Joey I am so sorry."
52,Joey,I told you not to move it!
53,Joey,"Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don't, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?"
54,Rachel,"Okay, come onJoey, I'll buy you a new one!"
55,Rachel,All right?
56,Rachel,We'll go down to the store right now and we'll-we'll get you a new chair.
57,Joey,She's not even cold yet!
58,Rachel,But don't you think Rosita would've wanted you to move on?
59,Rachel,"I mean y'know, she did always putyour comfort first."
60,Joey,That's true.
61,Rachel,Okay?
62,Rachel,You ready?
63,Joey,"Yeah, I  I don't want Stevie to see her like this."
64,Ross,I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in.
65,Ross,"Man, some-some stranger's gonna be living in my room."
66,Monica,"Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down."
67,Ross,They kept your room for a while.
68,Monica,Oh please!
69,Monica,Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out!
70,Monica,"I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogues, not a gym!"
71,Ross,"Come on, you know they love you."
72,Monica,As much as they love you?
73,Ross,I was their first born!
74,Ross,They thought she was barren!
75,Ross,It's not my fault.
76,Phoebe,Hey.
77,Ross,Hey.
78,Monica,Hey!
79,Phoebe,"Ugh, I hate this year!"
80,Ross,What's wrong with this year?
81,Phoebe,"Well okay, it's already February and I've only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!"
82,Monica,That was me and Ross.
83,Phoebe,Oh that's right!
84,Ross,"Hey, y'know if you want to pick up some extra cash?"
85,Ross,Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
86,Monica,Oh that's a great idea.
87,Monica,You're really good on the phone.
88,Phoebe,"Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had."
89,Phoebe,"Y'know, I probably wouldn't have to say spank as much."
90,Ross,What?
91,Phoebe,"Oh yeah, like you never called!"
92,Phoebe,"Okay, I can do that!"
93,Phoebe,"Oh, by the way, I love my office."
94,Phoebe,Oh okay.
95,Phoebe,"Umm, all right."
96,Phoebe,"Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?"
97,Phoebe,"Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs."
98,Phoebe,"Oh okay, well I'm sorry to bother you."
99,Phoebe,Bye-bye.
100,Phoebe,"Yeah you're right, this is easy."
101,Phoebe,"Oh well, all rightum, no offense, but you were kind of rude."
102,Phoebe,Oh.
103,Phoebe,No.
104,Phoebe,Oh wait yes!
105,Phoebe,"I do, I do have one question."
106,Phoebe,What is toner?
107,Chandler,Joey!
108,Chandler,Joe!

110,Chandler,Beer's still cold.

121,Ross,Mr.
122,Monica,"Oh, that's okay, I can't wait to see everything again!"
123,Monica,All of the memories Mr.
124,Monica,I used to love to play restaurant.
125,Ross,"Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater."
126,Monica,"Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!"
127,Monica,Mr.
128,Ross,Wow!
129,Ross,Great!
130,Ross,"Wait, dad who-who's cigarettes are these?"

142,Ross,Mr.
143,Ross,What?
144,Ross,Mr.
145,Ross,How are you ever going to sell this place?

155,Phoebe,"Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?"
156,Phoebe,"Earl, thanks."
157,Phoebe,"Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs."
158,Phoebe,"I'm hearing what you're saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner."
159,Phoebe,May I ask why?
160,Phoebe,I surely do!
161,Phoebe,"Umm, is-is that because you're out of toner?"

170,Chandler,My chair.
171,Chandler,"Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!"
172,Rachel,You will like it!
173,Joey,No I won't.
174,Rachel,You don't even know!
175,Joey,"Because, I know what I like and what I don't like!"
176,Joey,It's not the same thing!
177,Rachel,"Well look, if you don't like this"
178,Joey,I don't know why you say that so soon.
179,Rachel,"Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair!"
180,Rachel,The most expensive one in the store!
181,Rachel,"Hey, y'know what I was thinking?"
182,Rachel,We could name her Francette.
183,Joey,Francette?
184,Joey,What is she?
185,Joey,A couch?
186,Joey,Poor thing.
187,Joey,Cut down in her prime.
188,Rachel,"Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour."
189,Rachel,Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here.
190,Rachel,"Y'know, start the heeling process?"
191,Joey,"Well, I guess you're right."
192,Joey,"Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator."
193,Joey,"It's gonna be so said, and kinda cool."
194,Joey,She's heeled!
195,Rachel,That's weird.
196,Joey,"No it's not weird, it's a miracle!"
197,Rachel,It's not a miracle Joey!
198,Rachel,I'm sure there's some explanation.
199,Joey,Oh there is!
200,Joey,"If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!"
201,Rachel,"Joey, I really don't"
202,Joey,Can you tell me how this happened?
203,Rachel,Well no.
204,Joey,Miracle!
205,Rachel,"No, y'know what?"
206,Rachel,Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it!
207,Rachel,Or something!
208,Joey,Someone like anangel?
209,Rachel,"That's right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair."
210,Joey,Get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
211,Ross,Dad that won't matter to her.
212,Ross,"Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff!"
213,Ross,"See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her."
214,Ross,Mr.
215,Ross,"Well, can you blame her?"
216,Ross,Mr.
217,Ross,"Dad, dad I don't want to hear about it."
218,Ross,Mr.
219,Ross,"Well, not right now."
220,Ross,"Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we're gonna give her some!"
221,Ross,"Okay, grabgrab some empty boxes."

231,Ross,She-she could've won this!
232,Ross,Mr.
233,Ross,Sure!
234,Ross,"Ooh-ooh, what about this?"
235,Ross,Mr.
236,Rachel,I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!
237,Joey,"Yeah, me too."
238,Rachel,"Hey, how'show's the uh, miracle chair?"
239,Joey,Fine.
240,Rachel,Yeah?
241,Rachel,Wow!
242,Rachel,"Y'know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!"
243,Joey,No.
244,Joey,Really?
245,Rachel,Yeah!
246,Rachel,You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
247,Joey,My chair heels itself.
248,Phoebe,"Earl, you're not hearing me!"
249,Phoebe,All I'm saying is that you're not alone all right?
250,Phoebe,Everybody hates the people they work with!
251,Phoebe,"Wait, what was that?"
252,Phoebe,That sounded like someone being nice to you.
253,Phoebe,"All right so Earl, let's just forget about the people at the office, okay?"
254,Phoebe,There-there's gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for!
255,Phoebe,"What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?"
256,Phoebe,"Oh sorry, boyfriend!"

283,Ross,You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
284,Monica,Really?
285,Monica,Wow!
286,Monica,It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
287,Ross,Nu-uh!
288,Monica,"Oh, an old glove?"
289,Monica,Mr.
290,Monica,Wow!
291,Monica,Look at this!

307,Monica,And if you say the words medical marvel I'm going to Easy Bake your head!
308,Monica,Mr.
309,Monica,"So wait, Ross's stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!"
310,Monica,Mr.
311,Monica,I can't believe this!
312,Monica,Mr.
313,Rachel,Hey Chandler!
314,Chandler,Hey!
315,Rachel,"How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?"
316,Chandler,"Yeah, I'd love to but I've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore."
317,Rachel,"Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?"
318,Chandler,Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete?
319,Chandler,The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
320,Rachel,I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.
321,Chandler,That's awesome!
322,Chandler,That's great!
323,Chandler,What made you do it?
324,Rachel,"Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair"
325,Chandler,Whoa-whoa-whoa!
326,Chandler,You broke Joey's chair?
327,Rachel,Yeah.
328,Chandler,I thought I broke Joey's chair!
329,Chandler,That's why I replaced it with mine!
330,Rachel,Ohhhhh.
331,Rachel,That's how it got fixed!
332,Chandler,"Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?"
333,Rachel,Noo!
334,Rachel,Angels.
335,Chandler,I'm gettin' my chair back!
336,Rachel,What?
337,Rachel,Wh-hey!
338,Joey,"Well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all!"
339,Joey,Yeah!
340,Joey,"So, I guess this chair is mine now!"
341,Chandler,Joey you broke my chair!
342,Joey,Your chair?
343,Rachel,"Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!"
344,Joey,"So, there was no miracle?"
345,Rachel,"No Joe, no miracle."
346,Joey,Oh no this is devastating!
347,Joey,My faith is shaken.
348,Joey,I'm so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
349,Rachel,Uh-huh!
350,Rachel,"Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore!"
351,Rachel,All right?
352,Rachel,That is my chair now!
353,Rachel,You can sit on my lap!
354,Rachel,No I take that back!
355,Chandler,I think I should get the chair!
356,Joey,How do you figure?
357,Chandler,Because you  broke a chair and you  broke a chair!
358,Chandler,"The only one around here that hasn't broke a chair, is me!"
359,Rachel,No-no-no!
360,Rachel,This chair's not going anywhere.
361,Chandler,"Well, where's the logic in that?"
362,Rachel,"The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!"
363,Chandler,So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
364,Joey,That's right!
365,Chandler,What are you guys?
366,Chandler,Like a gang or something?
367,Joey,Yeah!
368,Joey,We are!
369,Rachel,We're the Cobras!
370,Phoebe,Excuse me!
371,Phoebe,Can you tell me where I can find Earl?
372,Phoebe,He's the supply manager around here.
373,Phoebe,Earl!
374,Phoebe,I'm Phoebe.
375,Phoebe,"Umm, look it, you-you can't kill yourself."
376,Phoebe,No-no I can't!
377,Phoebe,I can't let you do it!
378,Phoebe,Because it was fate that made me call you today!
379,Phoebe,No!
380,Phoebe,Think about it okay?
381,Phoebe,This isn't even my regular job!
382,Phoebe,Okay?
383,Phoebe,"And my first day on the job, you're my first call!"
384,Phoebe,"And-and somebody else might've hung up on you, but I wouldn't do that because I know about this stuff."
385,Phoebe,My mom killed herself.
386,Phoebe,Yes.
387,Phoebe,I'm not gonna give you tips!
388,Phoebe,Look don't you see that this-thisthis all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
389,Phoebe,"No, it's fate!"
390,Phoebe,Oh.
391,Phoebe,"Well umm, okay here's a weird thing."
392,Phoebe,My mother was also a supply manager.
393,Phoebe,Oh my God!
394,Phoebe,So was she!
395,Phoebe,And!
396,Phoebe,"Get this, okay?"
397,Phoebe,"Your-your name is Earl, right?"
398,Phoebe,"Her name was Pearl, P-Earl."
399,Phoebe,Sure!
400,Phoebe,"Umm, where are you from?"
401,Phoebe,Oh my God!
402,Phoebe,So was she!
403,Phoebe,"Oh, I've got-I've got goose bumps."
404,Phoebe,"Well, y'know I'm wearing layers and it's warm."
405,Phoebe,"But ifno look, okay."
406,Phoebe,"These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does!"
407,Phoebe,And that says a lot!
408,Phoebe,"Y'know, I don't-I don't think it's you."
409,Phoebe,This is a freaky place.
410,Phoebe,Hey!
411,Phoebe,Guys!
412,Phoebe,"Oh no, it's you."
413,Monica,"Oh, this terrible!"
414,Monica,Everything is destroyed!
415,Monica,Look at this.
416,Monica,"It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is!"
417,Monica,"Ohh, it's still soft."
418,Monica,What do you think this is?
419,Ross,All right.
420,Ross,I think it was a mouse.
421,Ross,Mr.

432,Monica,"Wait, you're giving me your Porsche, you're kidding me right?"
433,Ross,"Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute!"
434,Ross,I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
435,Ross,Mr.
436,Monica,All right!
437,Ross,"Well, what about me?!"
438,Ross,I'm a medical marvel!!
439,Ross,Ending Credits
