139,Phoebe,No I-I meant your costume.
140,Phoebe,I love the second grade!
141,Phoebe,Yeah!
142,Phoebe,It's so much better than first grade when you don't know what's going on and definitely better than third grade.
143,Phoebe,Y'know with all the politics and mind games.
144,Phoebe,"Umm, I'm a masseuseby day."
145,Phoebe,No I'm having fun.
146,Phoebe,I'm reallyAnd I'm really-really excited for you and Ursula.

165,Joey,I'm not sure.
166,Monica,What?!
167,Monica,Come on I am tough!
168,Monica,Punch me right here!
169,Monica,As hard as you can!
170,Joey,Will you relax?!
171,Joey,What are you taking this so seriously for?
172,Joey,It doesn't matter.
173,Monica,Oh really?
174,Monica,Okay?
175,Monica,"Well what would you say if I told you that, y'know, Ross or Chandler could beat you up?"
176,Joey,"I would say, ""Woman, please!"""
177,Phoebe,Hey.
178,Phoebe,Ursula's fiancée is really sweet!
179,Phoebe,"He's a teacher, he does all this volunteer work."
180,Phoebe,"Y'know normally y'know, I don't like really sweaty guys."

197,Chandler,Hi!
198,Chandler,Joey's gonna be thrilled!
199,Chandler,He was hoping you'd come by as a slutty nurse.
200,Chandler,"You'd think that would embarrass me, but you see I'm maxed out."

225,Chandler,"Oh relax man, relax."
226,Chandler,You're looking a little flushed.
227,Joey,"Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question."
228,Chandler,What question?
229,Joey,"Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?"
230,Chandler,There's no question.
231,Joey,So you think Ross too?
232,Chandler,You picked Ross?
233,Monica,Ross is really strong!
234,Monica,"Okay, he's the strongest out of all three of you!"
235,Monica,Except for Joey.
236,Chandler,I cannot believe you didn't pick me.

238,Ross,I am stronger.
239,Ross,I would destroy you.

241,Chandler,You think you're stronger?
242,Chandler,Why don't you prove it?

294,Monica,That's the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!
295,Chandler,That means nothing to me.
296,Chandler,Come on!
297,Phoebe,Hi liar!
