123,Phoebe,"{Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees!"
124,Phoebe,"Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}"
125,Joey,Great!
126,Joey,Problem solved!

230,Monica,They're still in my coat.
231,Rachel,Damn!
232,Chandler,Hey!
233,Joey,Hey!
234,Joey,You ready to go?
235,Chandler,"Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there?"
236,Chandler,Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?
237,Chandler,What?
238,Monica,I love you.
239,Monica,{There's another continuity error here.
240,Monica,"Before Monica says I love you, Chandler's holding the vests so that you couldn't see the collar, you could see all three, and they were folding nicely."
241,Monica,"After she says the line and the camera cuts back to Chandler, you can only see two out of the three, you can see the collar of the top one, and it looks like it was folded sloppily, unlike before."
242,Monica,"Hey, you notice things while spending this much time on this!}"
243,Joey,"Man, I wish Ross was coming with us!"
244,Joey,Y'know?
245,Joey,I'm gonna miss him!
246,Phoebe,Thanks a lot!
247,Phoebe,I just got that jerk out of my mind!
248,Chandler,"Hey, so where are we staying?"
249,Chandler,Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
250,Joey,"Uh no, not really."
251,Joey,It's an independent film y'know?
252,Joey,So we don't have a real big budget.
253,Joey,I figured I'd just stay in your room.
254,Chandler,"I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right?"
255,Chandler,"I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?"
256,Joey,Oh yeah!
257,Joey,"For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket."
258,Chandler,So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
259,Joey,Did you not hear the plot of the movie?
260,Joey,"""She's been dead for ten years."""
261,Joey,I'm gonna be a millionaire!
262,Ross,Hey!
263,Joey,Hey!
264,Ross,"I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh?"

276,Joey,See ya!
277,Rachel,"Well, wait a minute!"
278,Rachel,The puss is good!
279,Rachel,It means it's healing!
280,Ross,"Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading?"
281,Ross,Pheebs?
282,Ross,Hello?

286,Phoebe,"Oh, I'm sorry."
287,Phoebe,I didn't see you there.
288,Ross,"Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something?"
289,Ross,"'Cause if are please, tell me what it is I did!"
290,Phoebe,"Well, if you don't know I can't help you."
291,Ross,"Well, I don't know."
292,Phoebe,"Well, I can't help you."
293,Ross,"Well, whatever it is I'm-I'm very, very sorry."

307,Ross,"Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?"
308,Phoebe,"Oh no, I am mad at you."
309,Phoebe,I know that much.
310,Phoebe,"But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing."
311,Phoebe,You actually have a very sweet little hiney.
312,Joey,"Man, I'm getting pretty tired."
313,Joey,You're might have to take over soon.
314,Chandler,"We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once."
315,Joey,"Don't worry, it's out there!"
316,Joey,I think I just need lunch.
317,Chandler,Yeah.
318,Joey,You wanna eat?
319,Joey,My treat!
320,Chandler,Isn't that Ross's money?
321,Joey,Yeah.
322,Joey,Okay.
323,Joey,Ross's treat!

336,Chandler,No!
337,Joey,Is this movie gonna be my big break?
338,Chandler,No!
339,Joey,What?
340,Chandler,Yes.
341,Joey,"Dude you said, ""No!"""

344,Chandler,No!
345,Chandler,Ahhh!!
346,Joey,I don't believe this!
347,Chandler,"Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high."
348,Joey,What are you talking about?!
349,Joey,I'm the lead in a movie!
350,Chandler,They're not even paying ya!
351,Chandler,This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
352,Joey,Y'know what?
353,Joey,I don't need this!
354,Joey,Okay?
355,Joey,I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
356,Chandler,"Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break."
357,Joey,"Is that why you're on this trip, huh?"
358,Joey,Make me feel like a loser?
359,Joey,"'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone."
360,Chandler,"Oh, you don't want me on the trip?"

401,Chandler,"Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast."
402,Phoebe,That game should not be played without my supervision.
403,Chandler,"Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know?"
404,Chandler,"All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge."
405,Phoebe,What's in the bag?
406,Chandler,"Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me."

486,Phoebe,"Chandler's here, he was wondering  Okay, I guess he ran out of change."
487,Chandler,"Y'know, he won't even talk to me."
488,Chandler,How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
489,Monica,"Well, maybe you should send him something."
490,Monica,So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
491,Chandler,That's a good idea.
492,Chandler,I wonder where I could  get a basket of porn
493,Phoebe,"No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!"
494,Chandler,Really?
495,Phoebe,Y'know what you should send him?
496,Phoebe,A cartoon of cigarettes.
497,Phoebe,'Cause that why he could trade it for protection.
498,Phoebe,No.
499,Phoebe,That's prison.
500,Ross,"Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out."
