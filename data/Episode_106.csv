97,Ross,"Oh, thanks."
98,Ross,"Oh, you're the best."
99,Rachel,"Oh no, you're the best."
100,Ross,"Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store!"
101,Ross,"Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her."
102,Ross,That oughta get her talking to me again.
103,Chandler,"Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY."
104,Monica,"Rach, that's great!"
105,Monica,It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
106,Rachel,What?!
107,Rachel,I didn't have a good time in Greece!
108,Rachel,Ross abandoned me!
109,Rachel,"Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, ""Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?"""
110,Rachel,"I mean, it was sooo humiliating."
111,Rachel,I felt like such an idiot!
112,Rachel,"I mean, it's all my fault!"
113,Rachel,"And you know why, because I make very bad decisions."
114,Chandler,Oh that's not true.
115,Rachel,Yes it is!
116,Rachel,It is true!
117,Rachel,"I went, I went after Ross in stupid London."
118,Phoebe,London is stupid!
119,Phoebe,Stupid!
120,Rachel,"Phoebe, you were right."
121,Rachel,"I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me."
122,Phoebe,"Oh No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life."
123,Monica,I'll do it!
124,Rachel,That's fine.
125,Rachel,"So Monica, you are now in control of my love life."
126,Chandler,"Okay, I gotta go to work."
127,Chandler,"And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back."
128,Chandler,Pheebs!

131,Rachel,"Ohh, he's married!"
132,Rachel,Ross is married.
133,Rachel,I can'tI still can't believe it.
134,Monica,"Honey, sweetie, by the edges."
135,Rachel,"I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it"
136,Monica,Ohh.
137,Rachel,I mean it's my fault.

141,Monica,Smudgey!
142,Monica,Pictures!
143,Rachel,Oh my God!
144,Monica,Okay.
145,Monica,That's okay.
146,Monica,I-I know that you're very upset right now.
147,Monica,"I know, I know that wasn't about me."
148,Joey,I bet it was about her a little.
149,Monica,If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere!
150,Monica,"I mean, look!"
151,Monica,"Look, Gunther!"
152,Monica,"I mean, he's nice, he's cute."
153,Rachel,"Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda"
154,Monica,"Oh, what about that guy over there?"
155,Monica,Remember?
156,Monica,That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
157,Rachel,"Oh, I don't know."
158,Rachel,I don't know.
159,Monica,You're going to talk to him!
160,Monica,Y'know what?
161,Monica,"We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him."
162,Rachel,"All right, you're the boss."
163,Rachel,I guess I gotta do what you tell me.
164,Joey,Say that to him and you're golden.
165,Phoebe,Hey!
166,Rachel,Hey!
167,Joey,"Hey, Pheebs!"
168,Monica,We got out pictures back from London.
169,Monica,Here's all of us at the Tower of London.
170,Phoebe,Oh!
171,Phoebe,Here we all are!
172,Phoebe,"Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me."
173,Chandler,"All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?"
174,Phoebe,No.
175,Phoebe,I'm sorry.
176,Phoebe,It's just 'cause I couldn't be there.
177,Phoebe,"'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out."
178,Monica,What happened?
179,Rachel,"Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that."
180,Rachel,Got myself a date tomorrow night.
181,Monica,"See, didn't I tell you?!"
182,Monica,You're getting over Ross already!
183,Rachel,Well
184,Monica,What took you so long?
185,Chandler,"I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow."
186,Monica,"Oh, good."
187,Chandler,"So, thanks for having me over!"
188,Chandler,Rach.
189,Chandler,Pheebs.
190,Joey,See ya!!
191,Joey,What the hell was that?
192,Monica,"Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London."
193,Rachel,That's not European!
194,Phoebe,"Well, it felt French."
195,Rachel,"Oh God, I really had a good time!"
196,Rachel,Yeah.
197,Rachel,"Umm, unless you wanna come inside?"
198,Rachel,Okay.
199,Rachel,"Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what?"
200,Rachel,"I uh, I can't decide this."
201,Rachel,"Umm, okay, just hold on a second."
202,Rachel,"Umm, hi!"
203,Ross,Hi.
204,Rachel,Is Monica around?
205,Rachel,I-I have to ask her something.
206,Ross,She's doing her laundry.
207,Rachel,What's that?
208,Ross,"It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!"
209,Rachel,"Oh, honey that's awful."
210,Ross,"Oh, it's not so bad."
211,Ross,Monica's gonna make potpourri!
212,Ross,I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
213,Rachel,"But, it's not raining."
214,Ross,I can't catch a break!
215,Rachel,Y'know what Ross?
216,Rachel,You're not going anywhere.
217,Rachel,You're gonna sit right here.
218,Rachel,I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out.
219,Rachel,All right?
220,Rachel,"Hey, Dave!"
221,Rachel,"Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick."
222,Rachel,Okay?
223,Rachel,Bye!
224,Rachel,"Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now."
225,Monica,Rach?
226,Monica,Can I talk to for just a minute?
227,Monica,I-I dropped some socks.
228,Rachel,Yeah.
229,Monica,What is the matter with you?!
230,Monica,Do you want to fall into the trap?
231,Monica,Do you want to fall into the trap?
232,Rachel,Ohh!
233,Rachel,You did not drop any socks!
234,Monica,I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off!
235,Monica,"I mean, you listen to me!"
236,Monica,"Now, I'm calling the shots!"
237,Monica,I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave!
238,Monica,What the hell were you trying to do?
239,Rachel,"Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wantedtell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him."
240,Monica,What?!!
241,Monica,You cannot tell him that!
242,Rachel,Why?
243,Rachel,Why not?!
244,Rachel,People love to hear that!
245,Monica,"I make the decisions, and I say no."
246,Rachel,"Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired."
247,Monica,You can't fire me.
248,Monica,"I make your decisions and I say, ""I'm not fired!"""
249,Monica,Ha!
250,Rachel,Well
251,Monica,Rachel!!
252,Monica,Come on!
253,Monica,Let me in!

257,Joey,Commercial Break
258,Monica,Rachel!
259,Monica,Let me in!
260,Monica,Rachel!
261,Monica,Thank you.
262,Monica,"Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?"
263,Rachel,No.
264,Monica,I really need to talk to you.
265,Rachel,"Well, then talk!"
266,Monica,"Okay, I will."
267,Monica,Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
268,Rachel,Yes!
269,Ross,What thing?
270,Monica,"Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons."
271,Monica,Which I think is a really stupid idea!
272,Monica,"It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might  end up hurting."
273,Ross,"Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky."
274,Ross,I'm gonna use the phone.
275,Ross,I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily.
276,Ross,"My God, think of the massacre."
277,Rachel,I'm gonna do it.
278,Monica,"All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea."
279,Monica,"Because I bet you, you can't."
280,Rachel,But I
281,Monica,Please!
282,Rachel,"All right, fine."
283,Monica,"Joey, I'm in!"
284,Joey,All right.
285,Joey,Good deal.
286,Joey,"Uh, okay, Pheebs?"
287,Phoebe,Yeah?
288,Joey,"Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?"
289,Phoebe,Yeah?
290,Joey,"All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!"
291,Phoebe,"Ohh, that's so nice!"
292,Phoebe,How great!
293,Phoebe,"Well, where?"
294,Phoebe,Where's the trip?
295,Monica,"Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!"
296,Phoebe,Central Park!
297,Joey,"Yeah, all of us!"
298,Joey,All day!
299,Phoebe,That sucks!
300,Phoebe,That's not a trip!
301,Phoebe,I just came from the park!
302,Phoebe,What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park?
303,Phoebe,"""Well, it's right by my house, all right!"""
304,Chandler,"Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea."
305,Rachel,Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!!
306,Rachel,"Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey!"
307,Rachel,"Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I justy'knowstop it!"
308,Chandler,I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
309,Phoebe,"That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth."
310,Monica,Makes me wanna puke!
311,Ross,"Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!"
312,Joey,Phoebe!
313,Chandler,"Hey, Pheebs!"
314,Rachel,"Phoebe, woo!"
315,Phoebe,"Okay, woo!"
316,Phoebe,Hi.
317,Chandler,"Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little Y'know, it didn't have any It-it, well it blew."
318,Chandler,"So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!"
319,Phoebe,"Ooh, Atlantic City!"
320,Phoebe,"Oh, that's a great plan!"
321,Phoebe,Who's plan was that?
322,Joey,Mine!
323,Ross,Wait!
324,Ross,It was my plan.
325,Joey,"Nooo, I said we needed a new plan."
326,Ross,"And, I came up with Atlantic City."
327,Joey,"Which, is the new plan!"
328,Monica,"Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?"
329,Phoebe,Okay!

334,Rachel,I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.
335,Monica,No!
336,Monica,"Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him."
337,Rachel,"Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter."
338,Monica,"Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?"
339,Rachel,"Yeah, I-I don't care."
340,Monica,Okay.
341,Monica,I-I can't watch.
342,Rachel,What 'cha readin'?
343,Ross,The paper.
344,Rachel,"Yeah, what's it about?"
345,Ross,Events from around the globe.
346,Rachel,Okay.
347,Rachel,"Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong."
348,Rachel,"I mean, and you know how people can be wrong."
349,Ross,Sure.
350,Ross,"Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized"
351,Rachel,"Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here."
352,Ross,Yeah.
353,Rachel,Okay.
354,Ross,Go ahead.
355,Rachel,"Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it."
356,Rachel,Just gonna say it.
357,Rachel,"Uhh,  I'm still in love with you Ross."
358,Ross,Wow.
359,Ross,Umm Huh I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
360,Ross,What?
361,Ross,What?
362,Ross,Was that a joke?
363,Ross,'Cause it's mean.
364,Rachel,I'm so dead serious.
365,Rachel,I'm totally serious.
366,Ross,Why are you laughing?
367,Rachel,"Because , because, I just heard it."
368,Rachel,"I heard it, and it's ridiculous!"
369,Rachel,"I mean, you're married."
370,Rachel,"You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know?"
371,Rachel,"And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel  was like, ""You are such an idiot!"""
372,Ross,"Well, well I am married."
373,Ross,Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
374,Rachel,"I'm sorry, that's not funny."
375,Ross,"Actually, it kinda is."
376,Ross,My wife won't return my calls.
377,Ross,I don't know where my wife is.
378,Ross,"""Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?"""
379,Ross,Don't know!
380,Rachel,"Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?"
381,Ross,"Well, I kinda half to."
382,Ross,"I mean, because the thing is"
383,Rachel,"The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily."
384,Ross,That is what the thing is.
385,Rachel,"Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right?"
386,Rachel,"I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?"
387,Ross,No.
388,Ross,No.
389,Ross,"No, I'm-I'm glad you did."
390,Ross,"Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you."
391,Rachel,That's what I said!
392,Rachel,Thank you for being so nice.

412,Chandler,"I know, it's beautiful."
413,Chandler,Amazing.
414,Chandler,Y'know what else I can't believe?
415,Chandler,"I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex."
416,Monica,Do you know anything about women?
417,Chandler,No.
418,Monica,That's all right.
