166,Joey,When?
167,Joey,Today?
168,Joey,"Some, not a lot."

198,Rachel,What?
199,Monica,"See, I've been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I'm only planning on doing this once."
200,Monica,"So, uh y'know, maybe this is selfish and I'm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that."
201,Rachel,"Oh honey, but it is just about"
202,Ross,It is!
203,Ross,It is!
204,Monica,No it's not!

208,Rachel,What?
209,Monica,"See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!"
210,Ross,Okay!
211,Ross,Ho-ho!
212,Ross,We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
213,Rachel,Yeah.
214,Rachel,No.
215,Rachel,And you know what?
216,Rachel,Nobody even saw!
217,Ross,Yeah!
218,Monica,That's true.
219,Rachel,Honey I swear it we just kissed.
220,Ross,It was just a kiss.
221,Phoebe,You guys kissed!!!!!
222,Phoebe,What does this mean?!!
223,Phoebe,"Are you, are you getting back together?!"
224,Phoebe,Can I sing at your wedding?
225,Monica,Thunder being stolen!
226,Rachel,"Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing!"
227,Rachel,"Monica, come on!"
228,Ross,Look let's not make a big deal out of this!
229,Ross,It was a one time thing.
230,Ross,It doesn't even matter!
231,Joey,Oh my God!
232,Joey,I cannot believe you guys are talking about this!
233,Joey,The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!!
234,Joey,All right?!!
235,Joey,Now Chandler is doing the best he can!
236,Chandler,I don't think that's what they were talking about Joe!
237,Phoebe,"What a great night, Chandler can't do it, these guys kissed"
238,Joey,What?
239,Chandler,What?
240,Joey,You guys kissed!
241,Joey,Oh mythis is huge!
242,Rachel,No!
243,Ross,Oh no!
244,Rachel,"No-no, it's really not huge."
245,Ross,And; people thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.
246,Ross,Which we are not!
247,Monica,"Well, we're still talking about it, aren't we?"
248,Phoebe,"Well yeah, that and Chandler's problem."
249,Joey,"Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel."
250,Monica,Yes that would be lovely.
251,Joey,You got it.
252,Joey,Okay.
253,Joey,"Now, I can pass for 19 right?"
254,Chandler,"Yes, you can pass for 19."
255,Joey,Really?
256,Chandler,Yes!
257,Joey,Seriously?
258,Chandler,Seriously?
259,Chandler,"Seriously, no!"

264,Joey,Aww crap!
265,Phoebe,"Okay, so The Plaza!"
266,Phoebe,"Okay, we'll get us some Mai Thai's,  maybe no more for you though."
267,Monica,Y'know what?
268,Monica,"I-I think that umm, I don't feel like going to The Plaza."
269,Phoebe,Why?
270,Rachel,"Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous!"
271,Rachel,Look
272,Monica,"No-no, I-I really don't want to talk about it!"
273,Monica,I don't!
274,Monica,Especially with you.
275,Joey,"Psss, that is whack!"
276,Phoebe,Yeah?
277,Phoebe,"Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding."
278,Joey,Yeah!
279,Joey,"Well, I think we'll see if they actually let you play."
280,Joey,Huh?
281,Joey,"I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, ""You look 19,"" and then they just take it away like-like, ""No you don't."""
282,Phoebe,"Well, I don't think Monica is gonna take this away."
283,Joey,Wouldn't she?
284,Phoebe,Would she?
285,Joey,Would she?
286,Joey,You ate my candy bar!
287,Ross,Guess who?
288,Rachel,Hey.
289,Ross,"Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air"
290,Rachel,"What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn't want to talk, especially with me?"
291,Rachel,"I mean, why not especially you and me?"
292,Rachel,We were both out there kissing.
293,Ross,Still thinking about it huh?
294,Rachel,Come on!
295,Rachel,"Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that?"
296,Rachel,Especially you!
297,Ross,"Oh, who cares?"
298,Rachel,I care!
299,Ross,And so do I.
300,Rachel,"Y'know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?"
301,Ross,Okay.
302,Ross,Sure.
303,Rachel,Am I going to let you watch me undress?
304,Ross,No!
305,Monica,"I can't believe her, y'know it's justit's so typical."
306,Chandler,"Now Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget."
307,Chandler,"There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there's going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris."
308,Monica,Paris?
309,Chandler,We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
310,Monica,Keep talking.
311,Chandler,Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love.
312,Chandler,"Not just because it's romantic, but because I can!"
313,Monica,I love you!
314,Monica,"Bonjour, monsieur."
315,Chandler,"Okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away."
316,Chandler,"It's Paris, who knows we're here!"
317,Monica,"Hi Pheebs, what's up?"
318,Phoebe,"Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I'm just gonna need a small deposit."
319,Monica,What?
320,Phoebe,"Y'know, just some good faith money to hold the date."
321,Chandler,"Pheebs, we're not giving you a deposit for our wedding!"
322,Phoebe,"Oh, I see."
323,Phoebe,"[Cut to the living room, Joey is eating a sandwich.)"
324,Joey,"They break your heart, don't they?"
325,Phoebe,"Y'know, I don't really their permission."
326,Joey,Yeah!
327,Joey,"If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!"
328,Phoebe,Yeah!
329,Phoebe,"And if you wanna look 19, then you You gotta do something about your eyes."
330,Joey,What?!
331,Joey,What's wrong with my eyes.
332,Phoebe,They give you away!
333,Phoebe,There's just-there's just too much wisdom in there.
334,Phoebe,Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
335,Joey,And that'll get rid of my wisdom?
336,Phoebe,Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
337,Chandler,"Oh, give her the deposit!"
338,Chandler,Give her the ring!
339,Chandler,I don't care!
340,Monica,Yes.
341,Rachel,"Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?"
342,Chandler,What a great apology!
343,Chandler,And you accept!
344,Chandler,"Okay, bye-bye!"
345,Rachel,"No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?"
346,Monica,"Well, let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder."
347,Rachel,What?
348,Ross,"Hey, here's a thought."
349,Rachel,"Monica, what are you talking about?"
350,Monica,My Sweet Sixteen!
351,Monica,"Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie."
352,Chandler,"Ahh, third base."
353,Monica,It's all everybody at the party could talk about!
354,Rachel,"Monica, y'know what?"
355,Rachel,The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!
356,Monica,We had a characturist!
357,Rachel,Oh!
358,Phoebe,"""Whenever I get married, guess who won't get to sing?"
359,Phoebe,Somebody named Geller!
360,Phoebe,"And somebody else named Bing!"""
361,Rachel,"Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago."
362,Monica,"And yet, here we are doing it again."
363,Rachel,"Ugh, Monica I don't want to steal your stupid thunder!"
364,Monica,Oh please!
365,Monica,Why else would you have made out with Ross?
366,Ross,Got me.
367,Rachel,"All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain't gonna happen!"
368,Monica,I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
369,Rachel,"I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!"
370,Monica,"Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?"
371,Ross,"Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking."
372,Ross,I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea.
373,Ross,I'm calling it off.
374,Chandler,Why to save your dignity my man.
375,Rachel,"Monica, why?"
376,Rachel,Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
377,Monica,I don't know!
378,Monica,I don'tmaybe you're feeling a little resentful.
379,Monica,"Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first!"
380,Monica,Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
381,Rachel,Oh wow.
382,Rachel,Thaty'know what?
383,Rachel,That is so unfair.
384,Rachel,Y'know what?
385,Rachel,Now I want to steal your thunder!
386,Rachel,"Come on Ross, let's go have sex!"
387,Monica,I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night!
388,Chandler,"Well, somebody should."
389,Ross,"Look uh, if we're gonna do this"
390,Rachel,"We're not gonna do this, all right?"
391,Rachel,She's just gonna think that we're doin' it.
392,Ross,"Oh, I see, so everybody wins."
393,Rachel,Who is it?
394,Monica,"It's Monica, open up!"
395,Rachel,Okay well Ross!
396,Rachel,Stop it please!
397,Rachel,Wait a minute!
398,Ross,Oww!
399,Rachel,"Yeah, you like that baby?"
400,Rachel,May we help you?
401,Monica,"I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant!"
402,Chandler,How is that ever going to happen?
403,Rachel,"All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?"
404,Monica,I know why!
405,Rachel,No you don't know why!
406,Monica,Okay!
407,Monica,Why?
408,Rachel,Because!
409,Rachel,Because I was sad.
410,Monica,What do you mean?
411,Rachel,"Look, I am soso happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I'm not."
412,Rachel,I'm not even close.
413,Rachel,"And I don't know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better."
414,Rachel,"And I know that that's dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!"
415,Chandler,"I don't care, she slept with me."
416,Rachel,"Anyway sweetie, I am, I'm so sorry I ruined your night."
417,Monica,I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
418,Ross,"Well, I'm going to take off."
419,Ross,Congratulations man.
420,Chandler,Thanks.
421,Ross,"And uh, Rachel."
422,Rachel,Yeah.
423,Ross,"What can I say, you missed your chance."
424,Ross,From now on the only person who's going to enjoy these bad boys  is me.
