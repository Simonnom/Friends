3,Monica,Give it to me.
4,Chandler,No.
5,Monica,Give it to me.
6,Chandler,"Ok, you can have it."
7,Monica,"There you go, enjoy your coffee."
8,Chandler,That was there when I got here.
9,Phoebe,"Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York."
10,Monica,"Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow."
11,Phoebe,"Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy."
12,Rachel,You went out with a guy in the Navy?
13,Phoebe,"Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park."
14,Phoebe,Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.
15,Joey,"Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?"
16,Phoebe,No.
17,Phoebe,"No, he is my submaring guy."
18,Phoebe,He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together.
19,Phoebe,Only this time he's coming for two weeks.
20,Phoebe,"Two whole weeks, which means yay."
21,Rachel,"So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?"
22,Monica,That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
23,Ross,Hiii.
24,Joey,"Oh no, what happened?"
25,Ross,"Well, I just spoke to Carol."
26,Ross,Ben's got the chicken pox.
27,Ross,"Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it."
28,Rachel,Well I've had it.
29,Joey,"Yeah, I've had it."
30,Monica,Had it.
31,Chandler,Had it.
32,Phoebe,"Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out."
33,Phoebe,Oh look!
34,Phoebe,OPENING TITLES
35,Monica,"Honey, you made the bed again."
36,Monica,"I told you, you don't have to do that."
37,Monica,This isn't camp.
38,Monica,Baddest.
39,Monica,Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.
40,Monica,Just waiting for you sweetie.
41,Monica,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
42,Monica,"You know what, the way you did it was just fine."
43,Monica,"If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy."
44,Monica,"Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner."
45,Monica,I'm just easing you in.
46,Monica,"Alright, you see these little flower blossoms?"
47,Monica,"They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be."
48,Monica,You don't love me any more do you.
49,Monica,Really?
50,Monica,"Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point."
51,Chandler,"Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor."
52,Joey,But don't you need experience for a job like that?
53,Chandler,It's not that hard to learn.
54,Chandler,"And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor."
55,Chandler,"Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor."
56,Chandler,Hey thanks.
57,Chandler,"Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni."
58,Chandler,"Joey is a uh, fellow processor."
59,Joey,Oh yeah yeah.
60,Joey,I process.
61,Joey,"People want the processing, I'm the one they call."
62,Joey,"Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things."
63,Joey,You know how it is.
64,Joey,"One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more."
65,Chandler,I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
66,Joey,Ha-ha.
67,Joey,Are all you processors dorks?
68,Rachel,"Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you."
69,Monica,"You look fabulous honey, you really do."
70,Phoebe,Yeah?
71,Phoebe,"Are you sure, really."
72,Rachel,"You see, you look beautiful."
73,Rachel,"For god sakes, dim the lights."
74,Phoebe,"I, I, I'm hideous."
75,Monica,It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water.
76,Monica,He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.
77,Phoebe,Come in.
78,Phoebe,"Hey Ryan, what's up?"
79,Phoebe,"Well, no no, you have to stay back."
80,Phoebe,"I, I have the pox."
81,Phoebe,Chicken.
82,Phoebe,Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
83,Phoebe,"'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox."
84,Phoebe,"Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are."
85,Phoebe,"Ohh, ohh."
86,Phoebe,"Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now."
87,Phoebe,Nope.
88,Phoebe,You don't want to see a face covered with pox.
89,Phoebe,And you hate fish.
90,Phoebe,Oh.
91,Phoebe,"That's so sweet, alright."
92,Phoebe,"Ok, alright, you can see."
93,Phoebe,"This is me...  Oh, I am scary."
94,Phoebe,I hate this.
95,Phoebe,"'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this."
96,Phoebe,"Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had."
97,Joey,Hey.
98,Chandler,"Hey, how's the first day goin'?"
99,Joey,Pretty good.
100,Joey,It's like you said.
101,Joey,It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
102,Chandler,Well there you go.
103,Joey,Hey and everbody is so nice.
104,Joey,"I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie."
105,Chandler,"Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?"
106,Joey,"Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school."
107,Joey,Small world huh?
108,Chandler,Weird world.
109,Chandler,Your kids?
110,Joey,I figure my character has kids.
111,Chandler,Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
112,Joey,"Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that."
113,Joey,"My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany."
114,Joey,Ashley copies everything Brittany does.
115,Chandler,"Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes."
116,Joey,Yeah.
117,Joey,"Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid..."
118,Joey,Ya know what?
119,Joey,Just did.
120,Chandler,Really?
121,Chandler,Wow.
122,Chandler,That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
123,Phoebe,That you don't stop talking about it.
124,Phoebe,"Let's just play, ok. Good, ok."
125,Phoebe,"Here we go, double sixes, here we go..."
126,Phoebe,"Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice..."
127,Phoebe,No.
128,Phoebe,"This is what I do for luck, ok."
129,Phoebe,No.
130,Phoebe,No.
131,Phoebe,Here.
132,Phoebe,There.
133,Phoebe,"Ooh, double sixes."
134,Phoebe,"Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it."
135,Phoebe,It's just so hard.
136,Phoebe,I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body.
137,Phoebe,Give it.
138,Phoebe,"Yeah, come on."
139,Phoebe,"You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on."
140,Phoebe,"Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good."
141,Phoebe,"Now do me, do my back."
142,Phoebe,"Oh come on, harder."
143,Rachel,"Oh, stop that, stop that right now."
144,Ross,"You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man."
145,Joey,You and Milton have to join us on the boat.
146,Joey,"Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it."
147,Joey,"Oh, thanks, thanks."
148,Joey,Bye bye Jeannie.
149,Joey,What a phony.
150,Chandler,"Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing."
151,Chandler,Hey Mr. Douglas.
152,Joey,Sir.
153,Joey,MR.
154,Chandler,Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
155,Chandler,MR.
156,Joey,"Yeah Bing, what's that about?"
157,Chandler,"It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale."
158,Chandler,"Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday."
159,Chandler,MR.
160,Joey,This company was not built on rough numbers.
161,Joey,Am I right Mr. Douglas.
162,Joey,MR.
163,Chandler,"Uh, if you say so sir."
164,Joey,"Joseph's good, isn't he?"
165,Chandler,"Well, I'm going to kill you."
166,Joey,"Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up."
167,Joey,"Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers."
168,Chandler,Why?
169,Joey,"Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok."
170,Joey,"If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it."
171,Joey,"'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say."
172,Monica,This is for the scratchy twins out there.
173,Monica,I taped oven mits to their hands.
174,Monica,It's for their own good.
175,Monica,Exactly.
176,Monica,"Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now."
177,Monica,Tell me the truth.
178,Monica,Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?
179,Monica,Very good.
180,Monica,You know what.
181,Monica,Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
182,Monica,I'm gonna set them to my time.
183,Monica,No no.
184,Monica,"See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast."
185,Monica,You wanna know why?
186,Monica,"No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now."
187,Monica,No.
188,Monica,See you don't understand.
189,Monica,No.
190,Monica,You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.
191,Monica,Oh yeah.
192,Monica,"Alright, well tell me one of yours."
193,Monica,What if they get mixed up?
194,Monica,You would not.
195,Monica,I can't believe this.
196,Monica,"I hate this, you're too normal."
197,Monica,I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
198,Monica,My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
199,Joey,Hey.
200,Joey,Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
201,Chandler,Why?
202,Chandler,Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
203,Joey,'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
204,Chandler,"Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?"
205,Joey,Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph.
206,Joey,"But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you."
207,Joey,"Anyway, I just thought you should know."
208,Chandler,"Alright, that's it."
209,Chandler,"Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go."
210,Joey,"What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph."
211,Chandler,"I don't, I hate Joseph, ok."
212,Chandler,I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
213,Joey,Oh yeah.
214,Joey,Well you can't fire Joseph.
215,Joey,"You know why, 'cause he's not in your department."
216,Chandler,"Alright, ok, alright."
217,Chandler,"So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife."
218,Joey,Karen.
219,Chandler,"Yeah, Karen."
220,Chandler,I'm thinking about having an affair with her.
221,Chandler,"Oh, you know what?"
222,Chandler,I just did.
223,Joey,Ahh.
224,Joey,What the hell are you doing to me man.
225,Chandler,"Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy."
226,Chandler,Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler.
227,Chandler,"In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer."
228,Joey,Really?
229,Chandler,"No freakshow, she's fictional."
230,Joey,Take it easy.
231,Joey,"If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else."
232,Chandler,Thank you.
233,Joey,"It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph."
234,Joey,I liked him.
235,Joey,"His wife, she was hot."
236,Phoebe,Can I please take these off?
237,Phoebe,I swear I won't scratch.
238,Rachel,"No sorry hon, Monica's orders."
239,Ross,"Ok, dinner's on."
240,Rachel,And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you.
241,Ross,"Alright you kids, bye now."
242,Ross,PHOEBE and
243,Ross,"Oh look, a low budget puppet show."

255,Monica,"Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed."
256,Monica,"Alright, go on."
