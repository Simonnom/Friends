47,Joey,Guess what?
48,Ross,What?
49,Joey,I got a gig!
50,Chandler,"See, that's why I could never be an actor."
51,Chandler,Because I can't say gig.
52,Phoebe,"Yeah, I can't say croissant."
53,Phoebe,Oh my God!
54,Monica,What's the part?
55,Joey,"Well, it's not a part, no."
56,Joey,I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.
57,Ross,Come on!
58,Ross,That's great.
59,Joey,"Yeah, yeah."
60,Joey,It's like my chance to give something back to the acting community.
61,Ross,Y'know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
62,Joey,I know!
63,Phoebe,Ugh!
64,Phoebe,I don't know Monica.
65,Phoebe,It feels funny just being here.
66,Phoebe,"I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler."
67,Monica,Not at these prices.
68,Phoebe,Hi.
69,Phoebe,Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store.
70,Phoebe,Woo!
71,Monica,Oh!
72,Monica,Ohhhhh!
73,Monica,Oh!
74,Monica,"Phoebe, come here."
75,Monica,"Aw, this is my new bed."
76,Monica,You gotta feel this bad boy.
77,Phoebe,"Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend...  Oh!"
78,Phoebe,Oh my God!
79,Phoebe,"Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends."
80,Joey,Good evening.
81,Joey,I'm Mr. Tribbiani.
82,Joey,And I will be teaching acting for soap operas.
83,Joey,"Now um, on my first day as  Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives,  I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did."
84,Joey,And it goes like this.
85,Joey,"Thanks, thanks, a lot."
86,Joey,"Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive."
87,Joey,"All right, moving right along."
88,Joey,Hi!
89,Phoebe,Hey!
90,Phoebe,Ooh!
91,Phoebe,How was teaching last night?
92,Joey,Oh it was great.
93,Joey,"Yeah, you get to say stuff like, 'Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you, I dismiss you.'"
94,Phoebe,"Ooooh, nice."
95,Joey,"Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children."
96,Phoebe,"Oh, yay!"
97,Joey,"Yeah, it's this great part, this boxer named Nick."
98,Joey,"And I'm so, so right for it, y'know, he's just like me."
99,Joey,"Except he's a boxer, and has an evil twin."
100,Phoebe,Oh.
101,Phoebe,Okay.
102,Phoebe,"Oh, do I have a middle name."
103,Phoebe,All right Monica Velula Geller.
104,Phoebe,It's that bedroom there.
105,Joey,"Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?"
106,Phoebe,"Yeah, so please, please, please, don't say anything to Chandler."
107,Joey,You want me to lie to Chandler?
108,Phoebe,Is that a problem?
109,Joey,No.
110,Phoebe,"Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let's see what you got."
111,Phoebe,"All right ya, put em up."
112,Phoebe,Come on.
113,Joey,"Hey, you're ah, pretty good at this."
114,Phoebe,"Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren't acting Christian enough."
115,Joey,Ahh!
116,Joey,Hey now!
117,Joey,Hey!!!
118,Joey,Oww!!
119,Joey,And I'm bleeding.
120,Phoebe,Oh!
121,Phoebe,Oh!
122,Phoebe,Oh!
123,Joey,"Okay, great."
124,Phoebe,Wow!
125,Phoebe,And I'm a vegetarian!
126,Phoebe,"All right, all right, well I'm sorry, we'll put some ice on it."
127,Joey,Okay.
128,Phoebe,"Kay, put your head back."
129,Joey,All right.
130,Joey,I can't see.
131,Phoebe,"All right, I have ya."
132,Phoebe,Oh God.
133,Phoebe,"Oh, it's the compulsively neat one by the window, okay."
134,Rachel,Hi Daddy!
135,Rachel,Dr.
136,Rachel,You remember Ross.
137,Rachel,Dr.
138,Ross,Nice to see you again Dr. Green.
139,Ross,Dr.
140,Ross,"Ugh, museum."
141,Ross,Dr.
142,Ross,There never was a library.
143,Ross,"I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one."
144,Ross,Dr.
145,Ross,"Yeah, if you're really hungry."
146,Ross,"It was a joke, I made a joke."
147,Rachel,"Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster."
148,Rachel,Dr.
149,Ross,It's not a library... Dr.
150,Ross,"So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat."
151,Ross,Dr.
152,Ross,It gives it a nice antiquey look.
153,Ross,Dr.
154,Ross,Wow.
155,Ross,"I'm sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that."
156,Ross,Dr.
157,Rachel,Okay.
158,Ross,Okay!
159,Rachel,Aw honey stop!
160,Rachel,It's not that bad.
161,Ross,Yeah.
162,Ross,Op!
163,Ross,Uh-oh!
164,Ross,I think your Dad must've added wrong.
165,Ross,He only tipped like four percent.
166,Rachel,Yeah.
167,Rachel,That's Daddy.
168,Ross,That's Daddy?!
169,Ross,But doesn't it bother you?
170,Ross,You're a waitress.
171,Rachel,"Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers."
172,Ross,So?
173,Rachel,So.
174,Rachel,"Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change."
175,Ross,You really serve people sneezers?
176,Rachel,"Well um, I don't."
177,Rachel,Dr
178,Ross,"Thanks again, Dr. Green."
179,Ross,Dr.
180,Ross,"Oh, ah, you don't need that."
181,Ross,Dr.
182,Ross,"The carbon, it's messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness."
183,Ross,Dr.
184,Ross,"Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it's a sickness really."
185,Rachel,"Yeah it is, it is."
186,Rachel,"We really, really have to do something about that."
187,Ross,I know.
188,Ross,Dr.
189,Rachel,"Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't."
190,Ross,"Nothing I do means anything, really."
191,Ross,Dr.
192,Ross,Well Mr. Big Shot is better than wethead'.
193,Joey,"Okay, some tricks of the trade."
194,Joey,"Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling."
195,Joey,"Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil."
196,Joey,"That would be the basic I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it'  Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13."
197,Joey,And that's how it's done.
198,Joey,"Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed."
199,Joey,Hey-hey.
200,Joey,"Awww, one of my students got an audition."
201,Joey,I'm so proud.
202,Joey,You bet!
203,Joey,What's the part?
204,Rachel,"You had to do it, didn't you?"
205,Rachel,You couldn't just leave it alone.
206,Ross,Four percent.
207,Ross,Okay.
208,Ross,I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
209,Rachel,"Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along."
210,Rachel,"Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already."
211,Ross,"Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall."
212,Ross,"Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?"
213,Phoebe,"I'm, I'm freaking out!"
214,Phoebe,Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have!
215,Phoebe,"All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something."
216,Phoebe,Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
217,Rachel,Um.
218,Rachel,yeah.
219,Phoebe,I am soo dead.
220,Rachel,"All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay."
221,Rachel,"So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice."
222,Ross,"Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work."
223,Rachel,"Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here."
224,Ross,"Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say Like me!"
225,Ross,Like me tiny doctor!'
226,Rachel,"Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross?"
227,Rachel,For me?
228,Rachel,For me?
229,Ross,Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything.
230,Ross,"You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along."
231,Rachel,"Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay."
232,Rachel,"Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!"
233,Ross,"Okay, okay, okay."
234,Ross,I'll get the bagels.
235,Monica,What's this?
236,Phoebe,Isn't it cool!
237,Phoebe,Varoom!
238,Phoebe,Varoom!
239,Monica,This is not the bed I ordered!
240,Phoebe,"I know, you must've won like a contest or something!"
241,Monica,Phoebe!
242,Monica,Why is this car in my bedroom?
243,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, okay, I-I wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it..."
244,Monica,When did I sign for it?
245,Phoebe,When I was you!
246,Phoebe,"Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, cause he left his nose open!"
247,Monica,Did you make brownies today?
248,Chandler,"Knock, knock."
249,Monica,"Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed."
250,Chandler,"Hey, I'm going for sushi does anybody want..  Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp."
251,Phoebe,It's Monica's bed.
252,Phoebe,What?
253,Chandler,Okay.
254,Chandler,It's a racecar.
255,Phoebe,So.
256,Phoebe,"This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you?"
257,Chandler,"Okay, well it this bed isn't new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?"
258,Monica,Sometimes I have bad dreams.
259,Joey,Wow!
260,Joey,That was good.
261,Joey,That was... Tweezers?
262,Joey,Whoa.
263,Joey,That was really good.
264,Chandler,You told him to play the boxer gay!
265,Joey,"Well, I-I might've said supergay."
266,Chandler,You totally screwed him over.
267,Monica,"Joey, you're this guy's teacher."
268,Monica,I mean how could you do this?
269,Joey,"Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part."
270,Phoebe,"Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay."
271,Rachel,Hi Daddy.
272,Rachel,Dr.
273,Ross,Dr. Green.
274,Ross,How are you?
275,Ross,Dr.
276,Ross,Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.
277,Ross,Dr.
278,Ross,"Okay, that's it, I can't take it anymore."
279,Rachel,What?
280,Rachel,What?
281,Rachel,He's interested in you.
282,Rachel,"He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here."
283,Ross,"Oh, please."
284,Ross,"Sweetie it's hopeless, okay, I'm just gonna go."
285,Rachel,What?
286,Ross,"Look, look I'm sorry."
287,Ross,It's just that.... Dr.
288,Rachel,He's got this thing.
289,Rachel,And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor... Dr.
290,Ross,Thank you!
291,Ross,That's what I keep saying.
292,Rachel,"Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor."
293,Ross,Uh.
294,Ross,Dr.
295,Rachel,Well that's his last name.
296,Ross,And his first name.
297,Ross,Dr.
298,Rachel,It's Robert Bobby.
299,Rachel,Dr.
300,Rachel,"And um, excuse me, he helps me."
301,Ross,Oh-ho please.
302,Ross,Ask her how?
303,Ross,Dr.
304,Rachel,With my alignment.
305,Rachel,I've got one leg shorter than the other.
306,Rachel,Dr.
307,Ross,Argue with that.
308,Rachel,What?
309,Rachel,"It's true, my right leg is two inches shorter."
310,Rachel,Dr.
311,Ross,I know that!
312,Ross,Dr.
313,Rachel,"I'm sorry, let her?"
314,Ross,"What can I do, she doesn't listen to me about renter's insurance either."
315,Ross,Dr.
316,Rachel,No.
317,Rachel,Dr.
318,Ross,"Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?"
319,Ross,Dr.
320,Ross,Okay.
321,Ross,Wow!
322,Ross,This is going so well.
323,Ross,Did you see us?
324,Ross,Did you see?
325,Rachel,"Yeah honey, I'm standing right there!"
326,Rachel,Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet.
327,Ross,Excellent!
328,Joey,There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor.
329,Joey,"I had such an opportunity in the recent, present."
330,Joey,"And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually."
331,Joey,"Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him."
332,Joey,"And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV."
333,Joey,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
334,Joey,Thank you.
335,Monica,"Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed."
336,Joey,"All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king."
337,Joey,"Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king."
