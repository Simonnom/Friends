35,Monica,Opening Credits
36,Chandler,You know me sir.
37,Chandler,"Oh ah, I do have a question for ya."
38,Chandler,Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?
39,Chandler,Mr.
40,Chandler,What's funny about that?
41,Ross,Hey!
42,Ross,Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
43,Chandler,Hey that's okay.
44,Chandler,"So, where do you want to go?"
45,Ross,"Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go."

49,Ross,Yeah!
50,Ross,"I'm telling you, I like the food!"
51,Chandler,You like the Purple Rain display!
52,Chandler,Hey Bob.
53,Ross,Did that guy just call you Toby?
54,Chandler,"Yeah, he thinks that's my name."
55,Ross,"Well, why don't you correct him?"
56,Chandler,Oh it's been going on way to long now.
57,Chandler,"Y'know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn't say anything."
58,Chandler,"And then the next time he said, ""Hey Toby, do you want a donut?"""
59,Chandler,And I-I wanted a donut.
60,Chandler,"And now it's five years later, the donut's gone and I'm still Toby."
61,Ross,Five years?!
62,Ross,Chandler you have to tell him!
63,Chandler,No!
64,Chandler,That would be so awkward!
65,Chandler,"LookBesides, we work in different departments."
66,Chandler,He's on the sixth floor y'know?
67,Chandler,So he calls me Toby once in a while.
68,Chandler,What's the big deal?
69,Chandler,"It could be worse, it's not like he's calling me Muriel."
70,Ross,Muriel.
71,Ross,Wh-why would he call you Muriel?
72,Ross,Oh my God!
73,Ross,Chandler M Bing?
74,Ross,"It's not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!"
75,Chandler,Shh!
76,Chandler,It is a family name!
77,Ross,Chandler Muriel Bing.
78,Ross,"Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?"
79,Joey,"Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner."
80,Rachel,Well don'tWhat happened to Jessica's body?
81,Joey,"I'm not telling, you'll have to see it on TV!"
82,Rachel,You don't know do you?
83,Joey,"No, couldn't care less."
84,Joey,Joey's Co-Star
85,Joey,Hey you too!
86,Joey,Joey's Co-Star
87,Joey,What?
88,Joey,You weren't in it.
89,Rachel,Oh!
90,Joey,Oh sorry.
91,Joey,"Uh-uh, Kash?"
92,Joey,This is my friend Rachel.
93,Joey,"Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel."
94,Rachel,Hi.
95,Rachel,"Well, Joey probably thinks I'll just embarrass him."
96,Rachel,"Y'know, he thinks I'm some kind of a soap opera nutWhich I'm not!"
97,Rachel,I'm not.
98,Rachel,"Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan."
99,Rachel,"And uh, and that your-your dog's name is Wally."
100,Rachel,"Well look at that, I'm just stroking your arm."
101,Joey,Here we go!
102,Joey,Here we go!
103,Rachel,"Oh, we're leaving."
104,Rachel,Bye Kash.
105,Rachel,Say hi to Wally.
106,Phoebe,Ooh Monica!
107,Monica,Hi!
108,Phoebe,Oh my God!
109,Phoebe,I had the best time with Tim last night.
110,Phoebe,He is so sweet!
111,Phoebe,"Oh, I can't wait to get sous-neath him."
112,Monica,II have to fire him.
113,Phoebe,But why?
114,Monica,Because he's terrible!
115,Monica,"Okay, he's slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!"
116,Phoebe,"Well maybe he was just nervous, y'know you can be very intimidating."
117,Phoebe,And besides I've met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.
118,Monica,"Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished."
119,Phoebe,"But Monica, he loves his job so much!"
120,Phoebe,Can you just give him another chance?
121,Phoebe,Please?
122,Monica,"All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!"
123,Phoebe,That's fair!
124,Phoebe,Thank you so much.
125,Phoebe,Thanks.
126,Phoebe,"Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too."
127,Monica,I paid to have this done.
128,Phoebe,Love it!
129,Joey,Hey!
130,Rachel,Hi!
131,Joey,"Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day."
132,Joey,He said he thought you were charming.
133,Rachel,I thought I was a complete idiot.
134,Joey,"Hey, I'm with you."
135,Joey,He even asked me if I thought you'd go out with him.
136,Rachel,Oh!
137,Rachel,"Oh, I think I'm gonna throw up a little bit."
138,Rachel,What did you say?
139,Joey,I said no.
140,Rachel,What?
141,Joey,What?
142,Joey,II just figured since you're pregnant you're not gonna be seeing people.
143,Rachel,"Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people."
144,Rachel,"Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?"
145,Joey,I didn't tell him.
146,Joey,I didn't know if you were telling people.
147,Joey,This is back when I thought Kash was still people.
148,Rachel,"Good-good, don't tell him."
149,Rachel,Don't tell him.
150,Rachel,Just have him call me okay?
151,Joey,"Rach look, I really don't think that's such a great"
152,Rachel,"Okay, you go do it!"
153,Rachel,I'll come back to that set!
154,Rachel,I'll meet more actors!
155,Rachel,I'll meet em all!
156,Chandler,Hey Bob.
157,Chandler,"If I see him, I'll ask."
158,Chandler,Yeah!
159,Chandler,Mr.
160,Chandler,We're on a semi-first name basis.
161,Chandler,Mr.
162,Chandler,Bob?
163,Chandler,"Ooh, working here with us?"
164,Chandler,Everyday?
165,Chandler,"Yeah, I don't know if he has what it takes."
166,Chandler,Mr.
167,Chandler,But this is eleven.
168,Chandler,It's almost twice as hard up here.
169,Chandler,Mr.
170,Chandler,I think it's best sir.
171,Chandler,Mr.
172,Chandler,"Y'know what you should do, just toss em in the shedder and claim you never got em."
173,Chandler,Mr.
174,Chandler,What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?
175,Phoebe,Hey!
176,Monica,Hey.
177,Monica,"Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!"
178,Phoebe,But
179,Monica,No!
180,Monica,No-no!
181,Monica,He is totally incompetent.
182,Monica,I called the chef who recommended him to me.
183,Monica,"He said, ""Ha-ha!"
184,Monica,"Gotcha!"""
185,Phoebe,Okay.
186,Phoebe,"Okay, but you can't fire him today."
187,Monica,Why not?
188,Phoebe,Because I'm dumping him today.
189,Monica,What?!
190,Monica,You said he was sweet!
191,Phoebe,He is sweet.
192,Phoebe,He's too sweet.
193,Phoebe,He calls me all the time.
194,Phoebe,"""So did-did you get home from work okay?"""
195,Phoebe,"""Did-did you get out of the shower okay?"""
196,Monica,Just don't pick up your phone.
197,Phoebe,Then he comes over!
198,Phoebe,"""I'm so worried about you."""
199,Phoebe,Uck!
200,Phoebe,Be a man!
201,Monica,What?
202,Monica,So now I'm not allowed to fire him?
203,Phoebe,"You can't fire him and dump him the same day, he'll kill himself."
204,Monica,"Okay well then, I'll fire him today and you go out with him for another week."
205,Phoebe,Are you kidding?!
206,Phoebe,"Another week with that sip, I'll kill myself!"
207,Monica,"Okay well, then we'll both do it today and he'll just have to deal with it!"
208,Phoebe,Okay.
209,Phoebe,But the question is who's gonna go first.
210,Phoebe,Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.
211,Monica,What do you mean?
212,Phoebe,Come on!
213,Phoebe,"The boss that fires a guy that's just been dumped, bitch!"
214,Phoebe,"And the woman who dumps a guy that's just been fired, blond bitch!"
215,Monica,I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.
216,Phoebe,"All right, that makes sense."
217,Phoebe,Ugh.
218,Phoebe,ButScrew you I'm going first!
219,Chandler,"Sure, what's up?"
220,Rachel,"Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I'm not drinking on this date tonight."
221,Rachel,"""Umm, I'm a recovering alcoholic."
222,Rachel,"I'm a Mormon,"" or ""I got so hammered last night I'm still a little drunk?"""
223,Ross,Hey!
224,Rachel,Hi!
225,Joey,Hey!
226,Ross,"So, what do you want to do tonight?"
227,Ross,There's a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that's supposed to be very powerful.
228,Ross,Interested?
229,Joey,No.
230,Joey,No.
231,Joey,But I'll go see a normal person movie with ya.
232,Ross,Rach?
233,Ross,You wanna come?
234,Rachel,"Oh no, I can't."
235,Rachel,I got a date.
236,Ross,A date?
237,Rachel,Yeah.
238,Rachel,Why?
239,Rachel,Is that weird for you?
240,Ross,"Why no, it's the opposite of weird."
241,Ross,"It's-it's uh, regular."
242,Ross,"It's-it's uh, it's mundane."
243,Ross,"It's actually uh, a little dull."
244,Joey,It's no Ukrainian film.
245,Rachel,YeahOoh!
246,Rachel,Earrings!
247,Ross,A date?!
248,Ross,She's-she's got a date?!
249,Ross,With who?
250,Joey,I set her up with this actor on my show.
251,Ross,You set her up?
252,Joey,No
253,Ross,Joey what-what were you thinking?
254,Joey,"Well, I was thinking that it'd probably be okay because Ross hasn't gone out with Rachel in five years!"
255,Ross,"Joey, I'm not worried about her!"
256,Ross,I'm worried about my baby!
257,Ross,Whoever she dates my baby dates!
258,Ross,Now-now where is this  actor taking them?
259,Joey,Hey!
260,Joey,I'm an  actor too!
261,Joey,I'm not sure.
262,Joey,I think they're taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.
263,Ross,A ferry?
264,Ross,My baby is going on a ferry?
265,Ross,Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?
266,Joey,Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?
267,Ross,Why don't they just jump out of an airplane?!
268,Ross,Huh?!
269,Ross,That-that's a fun date!
270,Ross,Or burn each other with matches?!
271,Ross,That's fun too!
272,Ross,Whew!
273,Joey,Hey Kash.
274,Joey,Uh hey-hey this is Ross.
275,Joey,"Ross, this is Kash."
276,Ross,Hi.
277,Ross,I-I hear you're going on a ferry tonight.
278,Ross,A bit of a daredevil are we?
279,Rachel,Hey guys do you think this is too sluttyHi Kash!
280,Rachel,Yeah!
281,Rachel,"All right, I'll see you guys later."
282,Ross,Okay.
283,Ross,Have a great time you guys.
284,Rachel,Thank you.
285,Ross,Yes it is too slutty!
286,Ross,Commercial Break
287,Phoebe,Hi.
288,Phoebe,It will bein a minute.
289,Phoebe,"Listen, Tim you're a really great guy."
290,Phoebe,Aw.
291,Phoebe,I'm justI'm in a place in my life right now where II
292,Phoebe,Oh-oh no she doesn't!
293,Phoebe,I know what that is.
294,Phoebe,You can stay.
295,Joey,So what movie do you want to seeAnd not another one I have to read.
296,Joey,Okay?
297,Joey,I get enough of that from books.
298,Ross,Books?
299,Joey,"All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it's like enough!"
300,Ross,"Well, I tell you what."
301,Ross,"Why don't we uh, why don't we just stay here?"
302,Ross,"Let's not see a movie, we'll just hang."
303,Joey,And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?
304,Ross,"Hey, if that's what you want to do I'm not gonna say no."
305,Joey,Dude!
306,Joey,What is going on?
307,Ross,I justI have to find out how it went.
308,Joey,Why?
309,Ross,This guy could be my baby's stepfather!
310,Joey,They go on one date and you're worried about them getting married?!
311,Joey,He's not you!
312,Ross,I justI-I can't believe she's-she's dating?
313,Joey,"Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?"
314,Ross,I don't know!
315,Ross,I guess I just can't believe any of this is happening.
316,Joey,What do you mean?
317,Ross,It's just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different.
318,Ross,"Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan's, it's likeIt breaks my heart a little."
319,Ross,"I mean I've always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed."
320,Ross,And we all read the paper together.
321,Ross,Y'know?
322,Ross,Maybe fight over the science section.
323,Joey,That's a nice picture.
324,Joey,Maybe you can still have that!
325,Ross,No!
326,Ross,No I can't.
327,Ross,I mean Rachel's out with some guy.
328,Ross,My baby went with her.
329,Ross,If anything that picture keeps moving further away.
330,Joey,"Hey, can I ask you something?"
331,Joey,"In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?"
332,Ross,It used to be.
333,Ross,Now she doesn't really have a face.
334,Ross,Smokin' body though.
335,Joey,Good call.
336,Joey,Yeah.
337,Joey,"But, the face Ross, the face isn't Rachel."
338,Ross,No but ahh!
339,Ross,How much easier would it be if it were?
340,Joey,"I know, but I don't think that's what she wants."
341,Ross,"No, it's not what I want either."
342,Ross,I mean I-I can't force myself to fall in love with her again now.
343,Joey,That's okay Ross maybe you need a new picture.
344,Joey,Okay?
345,Joey,"It's not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there's gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby."
346,Joey,Who cares what the picture looks like?
347,Ross,Yeah.
348,Joey,"Hey, I tell you what."
349,Joey,Let's you and me go out and have some fun.
350,Joey,Huh?
351,Joey,Whatever you want.
352,Joey,Come on!
353,Ross,We can still catch that Ukrainian film.
354,Joey,"No, I said fun!"
355,Chandler,Hey Bobby.
356,Chandler,Uhh yeah.
357,Chandler,"Yeah, it's  right, right down there."
358,Chandler,"Right there, yeah."
359,Chandler,Can I ask you why?
360,Chandler,"Okay Bob listen uhh, I'm the reason you didn't get the job up here."
361,Chandler,Bob!
362,Chandler,Well that puts me in a difficult position.
363,Monica,Hey.
364,Monica,"Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe?"
365,Monica,Oh my pleasure.
366,Monica,"Okay, I'm afraid I've got some bad news."
367,Monica,Phoebe!
368,Phoebe,Monica!
369,Monica,You're fired!
370,Phoebe,I'm breaking up with you!
371,Phoebe,"I'm, I'm breaking up with you."
372,Monica,You're fired.
373,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, I'm justI'mI'm just not ready for a relationship right now."
374,Monica,Yeah and-and I'm sorry too.
375,Monica,"But, well I justI like things done a certain way and the chemistry's just not right."
376,Phoebe,"Oh that's good, the chemistry thing for us too."
377,Monica,Tim wait!
378,Monica,"Umm, I think I spoke too quickly."
379,Monica,There-there's a learning curve with this job and maybe we can try it again.
380,Monica,Yeah.
381,Monica,Okay.
382,Phoebe,"And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here."
383,Ross,Hello.
384,Rachel,Hi!
385,Ross,"Well, how was the date?"
386,Rachel,"Well I'm alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars, what do you think?"
387,Ross,Uh-huh.
388,Ross,What happened?
389,Rachel,I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant.
390,Ross,"Ah, he didn't uh, take it so well?"
391,Rachel,"Well better than you, but y'know still not what you want."
392,Ross,Oh?
393,Rachel,"He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, ""Yeah, I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch."""
394,Ross,He sounds swell.
395,Rachel,Doesn't he?
396,Ross,"Hey, wannawanna a little cheering up?"
397,Rachel,Yes.
398,Ross,Sit down.
399,Rachel,Okay.
400,Ross,Guess whose middle name is Muriel.
401,Rachel,Chandler M. Bing?
402,Ross,Yeah-ha!
403,Rachel,Oh my God.
404,Ross,I'm sorry about your date.
405,Rachel,Oh it's all right.
406,Rachel,I'm guess I'm just done with the whole dating thing.
407,Rachel,It's one more thing in my life that's suddenly completely different.
408,Rachel,This is hard.
409,Ross,Yeah I know.
410,Ross,"On the other hand in um, in about seven months you're gonna have something that you're gonna love more than any guy you've ever gone out with."
411,Ross,Just wait.
412,Ross,"Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger."
413,Ross,You have no idea.
414,Rachel,Thanks sweetie.
415,Ross,"You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?"
416,Rachel,"Oh no, I think I'm gonna go home and eat ten candy bars."
417,Ross,"Hey, I thought I cheered you up."
418,Rachel,"Oh you did, there are twenty in here."
419,Ross,Right.
420,Ross,Good night.
421,Rachel,Good night.
422,Ross,Yeah?
423,Ross,Oh hi!
424,Ross,Wow!

428,Ross,Great!
429,Ross,Well umm

431,Ross,"Uh, let me get it for ya."
432,Chandler,Bob.
433,Chandler,Bob!
434,Chandler,Bob!!!
435,Chandler,What the hell are you doing?
