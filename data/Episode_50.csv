219,Joey,I didn't know he could get me fired!
220,Joey,What am I going to do?
221,Monica,"Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy."
222,Joey,"Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here."
223,Monica,"No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.!"
224,Monica,You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
225,Joey,That's not a bad idea.
226,Joey,Yeah.
227,Joey,"Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys."
228,Joey,"Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs."
229,Chandler,"So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?"
230,Monica,Yeah!
231,Monica,That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
232,Chandler,"Yeah, you wish."
233,Phoebe,"""You wish."""
234,Monica,"Phoebe, stop writing about us!"
235,Phoebe,I'm not writing about you!

264,Joey,Stupid!
265,Joey,I can't believe it!
266,Joey,God!
267,Joey,"Hey, how you doin'?"
268,Rachel,"So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me."
269,Rachel,Wow!
270,Rachel,I definitely did not see that one backfiring!
271,Rachel,I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
272,Ross,"Yeah, take your time."
273,Ross,Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior.
274,Ross,So it wasn't as bad as-as
275,Ross,Not all bad.
276,Ross,Yeah.
277,Ross,You know what?
278,Ross,I know what you mean; I do that too.
279,Ross,No!
280,Ross,No!
281,Ross,NotI don't mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl!
282,Ross,"I mean I-I have a son, who's umm six and I still think of him as a baby."
283,Ross,"Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I'm sure you are with your wife!"
284,Ross,"Oh, I'm sorry!"
285,Ross,It's unbelievable!
286,Rachel,"Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake."
287,Ross,You're back.
288,Rachel,Oh!
289,Rachel,Whoops!
290,Rachel,"I'm sorry, you were talking about Emily!"
291,Monica,"Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six."
292,Chandler,We said seven!
293,Monica,We said six!
294,Chandler,"The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six."
295,Monica,"Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would've said something like this, ""Wow!"
296,Monica,"My boyfriend's such a wise assseven!"""
297,Phoebe,Hi!
298,Chandler,Oh my good God.
299,Monica,Ugh!
300,Phoebe,I know what time you said.
301,Chandler,What?
302,Phoebe,"Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said."
303,Monica,What time?
304,Phoebe,"Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it's my book to the rescue, huh?"
305,Phoebe,"Ooh, very interesting."
306,Phoebe,"Yeah, well this certainly clears things up."
307,Chandler,What does it say?
308,Phoebe,I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
309,Chandler,Thank you for writing your book.
310,Chandler,"Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything."
311,Phoebe,Thanks!
312,Phoebe,So are you.
313,Chandler,I told you I should not wear this color.
314,Phoebe,Mon  Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night.
315,Phoebe,"Marcia thinks they're supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it's at seven."
316,Chandler,So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
317,Phoebe,That's right.
318,Monica,Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
319,Phoebe,Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
320,Joey,I can't believe I'm going to lose this job!
321,Chandler,Oh I'm so sorry man!
322,Chandler,Is there anything I can do?
323,Joey,Yeah!
324,Joey,Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
325,Joey,Yeah?
326,Joey,"Well, I don't want to talk to you Wayne!"
327,Joey,I hate you!
328,Joey,You ruined my life!
329,Joey,"Oh, Chandler, Wayne."
330,Joey,"Wayne, Chandler."
331,Chandler,"Hi, how are ya?"
332,Joey,Why should I help you?
333,Chandler,The reason he just said.
334,Joey,What do you need?
335,Joey,Yeah?
336,Joey,What are you in love with her or something?
337,Chandler,"Yeah, I've been there my friend."
338,Joey,"Oh wow Wayne, it's not really something you can teach y'know?"
339,Joey,It's pretty much something you're born with if youYou-you can teach it!
340,Joey,I'll show you right how to do it.
341,Rachel,"I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage."
342,Rachel,Now wait a minute that's not fair.
343,Rachel,"He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn't tell me."
344,Rachel,Maybe I have to pee again.
345,Ross,Y'know what?
346,Ross,I-I-I I-I have had enough of this!
347,Ross,"Y'know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect!"
348,Ross,"So if-if you've got a problem with me, frankly"
349,Ross,God no!
350,Ross,"Well if it doesn't matter to her, it doesn't matter to me!"
351,Ross,Still not yelling!
352,Ross,"That's okay, I'm not so crazy about myself right now either."
353,Ross,"Uh yeah, I guessYeah!"
354,Ross,I guess so.
355,Ross,Ohhh!
356,Ross,Kids!
357,Rachel,"Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!"
358,Ross,"That's okay Rach, we're not liking Ross right now."
359,Rachel,Oh!
360,Rachel,I've got a lot of those too!
361,Rachel,Ending Credits
362,Joey,"Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E."
