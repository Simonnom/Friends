88,Chandler,I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
89,Joey,I thought you already have a job.
90,Chandler,And people say you don't pay attention.
91,Chandler,"No, this is a much better job."
92,Chandler,It's vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.

99,Monica,Well  I'm getting my revenge!
100,Joey,You cooked him?
101,Monica,No.
102,Monica,"He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again."
103,Monica,"Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow!"
104,Monica,"""Restaurant reviewer"
105,Chandler,The front page?

108,Ross,Oh.
109,Rachel,No-no-no!
110,Rachel,"No, no, no, we're not married."
111,Ross,"We are having a baby together, but we're not involved."
112,Ross,"I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while ago, but then we were just friends."
113,Ross,And then there was one drunken night.
114,Ross,"Or, yes stranger, we'd like this delivered please."
115,Ross,"Oh, okay."
116,Rachel,Oh yeah!
117,Rachel,"Actually, that's one of the reasons why we're not a couple."
118,Ross,"I chose those, I'm a paleontologist."
119,Rachel,Oh.
120,Rachel,"Oh yeah, don't get to worked up over it."
121,Rachel,"I mean it-it sounds like he's a doctor, but he's not."
122,Ross,Yeah!
123,Ross,I-I teach it in my class.
124,Rachel,Oh my God!

134,Rachel,A whore.
135,Phoebe,What?
136,Rachel,"Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started flirting with him."
137,Phoebe,Well did she know you two weren't married?
138,Rachel,Yeah.
139,Phoebe,Oh my God!
140,Phoebe,"Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man, we-we must alert the church elders!"
141,Rachel,You don't understand!
142,Rachel,You didn't see how brazen she was.
143,Phoebe,Sounds like you're a little jealous.
144,Rachel,No!
145,Rachel,I'm not!
146,Rachel,I-I-I just think it's wrong!
147,Rachel,It's-it's that I'mHere I am about to pop and he's out picking up some shop girl at Sluts R' Us!

149,Phoebe,Are they hiring?
150,Chandler,Hey Phoebe!
151,Chandler,Fatty!
152,Phoebe,"Hey Chandler, why so fancy?"
153,Chandler,"Well, I got a job interview."
154,Chandler,It's kinda a big deal too.
155,Chandler,Its a lot more money and I'd be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.
156,Phoebe,"Wait, I think I know someone who does that."

171,Chandler,Are you serious?
172,Phoebe,"Yes, when I first met you, you were like, ""Blah, blah, blah."""
173,Phoebe,"I was like, shhh!"
174,Chandler,What is it that I do?
175,Phoebe,Well it's just like you're trying too hard.
176,Phoebe,"Always making jokes, y'know, you justYou come off a little needy."
177,Chandler,Did you like me when we first met?
