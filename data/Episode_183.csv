13,Joey,Opening Credits
14,Ross,"I don't know whether he's testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control."
15,Ross,"But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, ""supposedly"" by accident."
16,Rachel,"No, yeah, I've done that."
17,Ross,"And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword."
18,Rachel,I've never done that.
19,Chandler,"All right, now look at her and tell me she doesn't look exactly like her sister."
20,Joey,I'm sayin' I see a difference.
21,Chandler,They're twins!

48,Rachel,"Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just don't get along?"
49,Phoebe,"It's mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day."
50,Phoebe,"But, to my parents, by then it was like ""yeah, right, well what else is new?"""
51,Ross,"Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, I've got to go."
52,Ross,I've got Lamaze class.

59,Ross,"I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation."
60,Monica,"Ross, that's my jacket."
61,Ross,I know.
62,Ross,"Hi, um, I'm err,  I'm Ross Geller, and err ah...  ..that's, that's my boy in there, and uh,  this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch."

68,Ross,"Err, right."
69,Ross,A little.
70,Ross,Absolutely.

92,Ross,"Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote..."
93,Monica,Great.
94,Ross,"Relax, I'll fix it."
95,Rachel,"Cool... ""Urkel"" in Spanish is ""Urkel."""
96,Ross,How did he do this?
97,Chandler,"So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?"
98,Monica,"Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Year's... but obviously someone forgot."
99,Rachel,"Well, someone was supposed to write ""Rach, take down the lights"" and put it on the re... frigerate...  How long has that been there?"
100,Chandler,"Hey, where you been?"
101,Joey,I went back to Riff's.
102,Joey,I think Ursula likes me.
103,Joey,"All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries."
104,Chandler,Score.
105,Joey,She is so hot!
106,Chandler,"Yeah, listen."
107,Chandler,"Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err..."
108,Joey,Pheebs?
109,Phoebe,Yeah?
110,Joey,You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?
111,Phoebe,Why?
112,Phoebe,Why would you wanna... do that?
113,Phoebe,Why?
114,Joey,"So that if we went out on a date, she'd be there."
115,Phoebe,"Well, I mean, I'm not my sister's, you know, whatever, and um..."
116,Phoebe,"I mean, it's true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, we've grown apart, so, um..."
117,Phoebe,"I don't know, why not?"
118,Phoebe,Okay.
119,Joey,"Cool, thanks."
120,Ross,You okay?
121,Phoebe,Yeah I'm fine.
122,Ross,You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
123,Ross,Sorry.
124,Ross,Hi.
125,Ross,Sorry I'm late.
126,Ross,"Where's, where's Carol?"
127,Ross,No... No... No.
128,Ross,"I think I should stay, I think we should both know what's going on."
129,Ross,"Okay, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time."
130,Ross,I see.
131,Ross,So what do you propose to do?
132,Ross,Flip me for it?
133,Ross,"No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!"

135,Chandler,Mr.
136,Chandler,And?
137,Chandler,Mr.

143,Chandler,Nina.
144,Chandler,Nina.
145,Chandler,"Yes, yes I am."
146,Chandler,"Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please don't hate me."
147,Chandler,Would you like to have dinner sometime?
148,Rachel,"So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?"
149,Phoebe,"Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me."
150,Rachel,Okay... Let me put it this way.
151,Rachel,Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?
152,Phoebe,Ooh!
153,Phoebe,Bath salts would be nice.
154,Rachel,"Ooh, okay... good."
155,Phoebe,Yeah?
156,Phoebe,"Right, and it's me."
157,Phoebe,Much as you are.
158,Phoebe,"Oh, that's good."
159,Phoebe,Good choice.
160,Monica,I can't believe you.
161,Monica,You still haven't told that girl she doesn't have a job yet?
162,Chandler,"Well, you still haven't taken down the Christmas lights."
163,Monica,"Congratulations, I think you've found the world's thinnest argument."
164,Chandler,"I'm just trying to find the right moment, you know?"
165,Rachel,"Oh, well, that shouldn't be so hard, now that you're dating."
166,Rachel,"""Sweetheart, you're fired, but how 'bout a quickie before I go to work?"""
167,Joey,Hey.
168,Joey,Rachel and
169,Chandler,Hey.
170,Chandler,"You know, once you're inside, you don't have to knock any more."
171,Monica,I'll get it.
172,Monica,Oh.
173,Monica,"Hi, Mr.Heckles."
174,Monica,Mr.Heckles
175,Monica,We're not doing anything.
176,Monica,"We're just sitting around talking, quietly."
177,Monica,Mr.Heckles
178,Rachel,You don't even have cats.
179,Rachel,Mr.Heckles
180,Monica,Goodbye Mr.Heckles.
181,Rachel,We'll try to keep it down.
182,Joey,"Phoebe, could you do me a favour?"
183,Joey,Could you try this on?
184,Joey,I just wanna make sure it fits.
185,Phoebe,"Ooh, my first birthday present...  ..oh, this is really..."
186,Joey,"Oh, no no no."
187,Joey,It's for Ursula.
188,Joey,"I just figured, you know, size-wise."
189,Phoebe,"Ohhh... Sure, yeah...  ..okay, it fits."
190,Rachel,Are you seein' her again tonight?
191,Joey,Yep.
192,Joey,Ice Capades.
193,Chandler,"Wow, this is serious."
194,Chandler,I've never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
195,Joey,I don't know.
196,Joey,"I like her, you know."
197,Joey,She's different.
198,Joey,"There's uh, somethin' about her."
199,Phoebe,"That you like,  we get it."
200,Phoebe,You like her.
201,Phoebe,Great!
202,Joey,"Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay."
203,Phoebe,"Alright, well, maybe now it's not okay."
204,Joey,Okay... Well maybe now I'm not okay with it not being okay.
205,Phoebe,Okay.
206,Chandler,"Knit, good woman, knit, knit!"
207,Chandler,And that's the Chrysler Building right there.
208,Chandler,Mr.
209,Chandler,"Yes, yes she is."
210,Chandler,Didn't I memo you on this?
211,Chandler,"See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan."
212,Chandler,"And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy."
213,Chandler,Mr.
214,Chandler,"Oh, no, no."
215,Chandler,Nina...  ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo!
216,Chandler,"In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all."
217,Chandler,Mr.
218,Chandler,"And yet, believable."
219,Chandler,"So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others."
220,Chandler,Mr.
221,Chandler,"Well, I guess that's why they call it psychology, sir."
222,Ross,"Susan, go deep."
223,Ross,"Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everything's gonna be alright."
224,Ross,I'm gonna be a father.
225,Rachel,This is just occurring to you?
226,Ross,"I always knew I was havin' a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me."
227,Rachel,"Oh, you're gonna be great!"
228,Ross,"Aw, how can you say that?"
229,Ross,I can't even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat.
230,Ross,How am I gonna raise a kid?
231,Chandler,"You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different."
232,Phoebe,Where're you going?
233,Joey,Out.
234,Phoebe,With?
235,Joey,Yes.
236,Phoebe,"Alright, could I just ask you one question?"
237,Phoebe,"Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?"
238,Joey,"Well, not that it's any of your business, but, no, we haven't, okay?"
239,Joey,"You meant sex, right?"
240,Chandler,"Ah, sure, Nina."
241,Chandler,What's up?
242,Chandler,"Oh, well, ah... maybe that's because they're ah... jealous, of us."
243,Chandler,"Ah, well, maybe that's, ah, because you're getting a big raise."
244,Chandler,"Sure, why not?"
245,Chandler,"Oh, you don't know."
246,Chandler,"Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder's raise?"
247,Chandler,Helen drinks.
248,Chandler,Will you marry me?
249,Chandler,"Well, I ended up telling her everything."
250,Rachel,"Oh, how'd she take it?"
251,Chandler,Pretty well.
252,Chandler,Except for the stapler thing.
253,Chandler,Little
254,Monica,"Okay, I think I get how to do this."
255,Phoebe,"Alright, so, can we turn this off?"
256,Phoebe,Can we just make it... make them go away?
257,Phoebe,"Because I can't, I can't watch."
258,Monica,"okay, Pheebs, they're gone."
259,Phoebe,Okay.
260,Monica,Are you alright?
261,Phoebe,Yeah.
262,Phoebe,"It's just, you know, it's this whole stupid Ursula thing, it's..."
263,Rachel,"Okay, Pheebs, can I ask?"
264,Rachel,"So, he's going out with her."
265,Rachel,"I mean, is it really so terrible?"
266,Phoebe,"Um, yeah."
267,Phoebe,"Look, I mean, I'm not saying she's like evil or anything."
268,Phoebe,"She just, you know, she's always breaking my stuff."
269,Phoebe,"When I was eight, and I wouldn't let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus."
270,Phoebe,"And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?"
271,Phoebe,Monica and
272,Rachel,No.
273,Phoebe,"Well, but that's what he was for me."
274,Phoebe,"And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldn't even talk to me any more."
275,Phoebe,Because he said he didn't wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us.
276,Rachel,"Oh... Oh, Pheebs."
277,Phoebe,"I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but..."
278,Chandler,You're not gonna lose him.
279,Monica,"Hon, you gotta talk to Joey."
280,Phoebe,Yeah.
281,Phoebe,Okay.
282,Ross,"No, come on, he doesn't know this stuff."
283,Ross,If he knew how you felt.
284,Phoebe,But he's falling in love with her.
285,Rachel,"Oh please, they've been going out a week."
286,Rachel,"They haven't even slept together yet, I mean, that's not serious."
287,Phoebe,Okay...
288,Phoebe,Okay.
289,Phoebe,"Oh, okay, oh."
290,Monica,"Rachel, what are you doing?"
291,Monica,It's freezing out here.
292,Monica,Would you come back inside?
293,Rachel,No no no no no.
294,Rachel,"You wanted me to take them down, so..."
295,Rachel,..I'm takin' 'em down.
296,Rachel,Okay?
297,Rachel,Whoa!
298,Monica,Oh-my-god Rachel!
299,Monica,Rachel!
300,Rachel,I'm okay!
301,Rachel,I'm okay!
302,Rachel,"Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?"
303,Rachel,Mr.Heckles
