163,Monica,"Oh honey, we're close now but you-you wouldn't believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and.... That's where the waistband actually goes over your head."
164,Phoebe,Ah!

264,Joey,"Maybe, my ruler's wrong."
265,Phoebe,Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
266,Joey,Look it's not that bad.
267,Joey,"So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door."
268,Chandler,"Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea."

283,Ross,"Yeah, maybe."
284,Rachel,"Oh-oh, you lie."

286,Rachel,"Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me."
287,Ross,"Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated."
288,Rachel,"You know what honey, you go ahead, we'll call her an alternate."
289,Ross,"Okay, hold my crawler."

299,Ross,"Well, yeah, kinda."
300,Ross,"Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people,  so I'm allowed to sleep with you."
301,Ross,"No, no, no, it's flattery."
