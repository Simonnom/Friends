1,Phoebe,"Yeah, this is fun, couples night."
2,Chandler,"Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often."
3,Monica,"Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away."
4,Chandler,You mean that Portuguese couple?
5,Chandler,"Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it."
6,Ross,"Hey, you guys..."
7,Ross,I have great news.
8,Monica,"Ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner here."
9,Ross,"Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure...!"
10,Ross,Guess what happened at work today...
11,Chandler,A dinosaur died a million years ago?
12,Ross,"Try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh.... My tenure review board met today and I hear it's looking really good."
13,Phoebe,Wow!
14,Ross,Yeah.
15,Ross,"Do you have any idea what this means in academic circles, uh?"
16,Ross,I am gonna get laid.
17,Rachel,Hi you guys.
18,Rachel,"Ooh, Italian!"
19,Monica,"No one wanted seconds, right?"
20,Ross,"No, no."
21,Ross,I-I'm good.
22,Rachel,Hey you guys... You're never gonna believe it.
23,Rachel,This headhunter called me.
24,Rachel,I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci.
25,Rachel,Gucci wants me.
26,Ross,I'm up for tenure.
27,Rachel,Congratulations!
28,Ross,You too!
29,Ross,What are the odds?
30,Rachel,Ooh!

32,Joey,I finally got that seed out of my teeth.
33,Monica,I don't know who I'm happiest for...
34,Phoebe,"I do, he's been working on that all day!"
35,Phoebe,OPENING CREDITS
36,Phoebe,Hey Mon?
37,Phoebe,Was it weird changing your name to Geller-Bing?
38,Monica,"No, no."
39,Monica,It felt nice to acknowledge this.
40,Phoebe,Where did you go to do it?
41,Monica,Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...
42,Chandler,YOU NEVER DID IT!
43,Monica,I'm sorry.
44,Monica,It's just the idea of being an official Bing.
45,Chandler,Hey!
46,Chandler,"I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding."
47,Chandler,Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.
48,Phoebe,Thanks!
49,Phoebe,"Honey, would you want me to take your name?"
50,Phoebe,"All right, let's see, call me mrs Hannigan."
51,Chandler,Mrs Hannigan?
52,Phoebe,What?
53,Phoebe,Can't you see I'm in the middle of something?
54,Phoebe,"Ooh, I like it."
55,Joey,Hey guys.
56,Chandler,Hey Joe!
57,Chandler,We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house.
58,Chandler,You want to come with us?
59,Joey,"No, thank you."
60,Monica,All right.
61,Monica,"I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house."
62,Chandler,"Yeah, come with us."
63,Chandler,You'll see how close it is to the city.
64,Joey,"But no, it's not close."
65,Joey,You said it was in escrow?
66,Joey,I couldn't even find it on the map.
67,Monica,"Joey, please come."
68,Monica,It would mean so much to us.
69,Joey,You know what?
70,Joey,"You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you."
71,Joey,SHOTGUN!
72,Chandler,Damn it.
73,Monica,See you guys later.
74,Phoebe,Okay!
75,Monica,I'll pick you up at eleven.
76,Monica,So glad you're coming.
77,Phoebe,Good for you.
78,Phoebe,That was really mature.
79,Joey,What?
80,Joey,"No, the only reason  I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move."
81,Joey,I'm gonna make them stay here.
82,Phoebe,"Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do."
83,Phoebe,"Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just..."
84,Phoebe,"All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house."
85,Phoebe,You are not gonna talk them into staying here.
86,Joey,"Hey, hey..."
87,Joey,"I can convince people to do anything, you know."
88,Joey,"I bet I can even get Mike to do that ""thing""."
89,Joey,What is it?
90,Joey,I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT!
91,Joey,Goodbye!
92,Rachel,"Hi, I'm here to see mr Campbell... with Gucci."
93,Rachel,The reservation is probably under Gucci.
94,Rachel,"It's spelled like Gukki, which could be confusing."
95,Rachel,Maitre d'
96,Rachel,Oh my God!
97,Rachel,That's my boss.
98,Rachel,You have to seat us somewhere else.
99,Rachel,Maitre d'
100,Rachel,But my... but my boss cannot see me.
101,Rachel,I'm interviewing for another job.

105,Rachel,Hi...
106,Rachel,I'm on a date... Mr

108,Rachel,"Yeah, you know, it's tough."
109,Rachel,"Single mom, career... You gotta get out there."
110,Rachel,Mr
111,Rachel,Oh.
112,Rachel,Mr
113,Rachel,"Yes, hi!"
114,Rachel,Mr
115,Rachel,Hi!

120,Rachel,Mr
121,Rachel,Wha... My resumé?
122,Rachel,I wouldn't...
123,Rachel,I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resumé.
124,Rachel,Mr
125,Rachel,Whatever happened to just singing for  no reason?
126,Rachel,Huh?
127,Rachel,Mr
128,Rachel,What?
129,Rachel,I-I don't.
130,Rachel,Mr
131,Rachel,"No, I-I-I love it there."
132,Rachel,Mr
133,Phoebe,This place is so depressing.
134,Phoebe,If I had to work here I'd kill myself.
135,Phoebe,But you obviously haven't.
136,Phoebe,"I need to change my name, please."
137,Phoebe,"See, I need to change it because I'm-I'm hiding from the law."
138,Phoebe,You're fun.
139,Phoebe,"Okay, well, I just don't, I don't know how it works exactly."
140,Phoebe,"See, my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?"
141,Phoebe,"Well, not anything, I mean..."
142,Phoebe,"Oh, this could take a while."
143,Phoebe,Okay.
144,Phoebe,Hey!
145,Monica,Hey Pheebs.
146,Phoebe,"Oh, not anymore."
147,Phoebe,I changed it today.
148,Monica,"Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan."
149,Phoebe,Wrong again!
150,Phoebe,Apparently you can change it to anything you want.
151,Phoebe,"So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative."
152,Phoebe,So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.
153,Chandler,That's what we were gonna name the baby.
154,Monica,Phoebe!
155,Phoebe,Uh!
156,Phoebe,Princess Consuela.
157,Monica,You seriously changed your name to that?
158,Phoebe,Uh-huh!
159,Monica,"Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?"
160,Phoebe,"Uhm, no."
161,Phoebe,I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.
162,Chandler,"Hey, how'd the interview go?"
163,Rachel,Oh!
164,Rachel,It's not good.
165,Chandler,"You know, I always feel that way after an interview."
166,Chandler,I'll bet it went better than you think.
167,Rachel,"Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren."
168,Chandler,That is a bad interview.
169,Phoebe,"What are you, what are you talking about?"
170,Phoebe,How did this happen?
171,Rachel,"Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything."
172,Rachel,"So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player."
173,Rachel,"And I said ""Wait a minute!"
174,Rachel,"Yes I am."""
175,Rachel,and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.
176,Monica,Oh God.
177,Monica,I'm so sorry.
178,Ross,Hey!
179,Ross,Wha-hoo!
180,Ross,What's this?
181,Ross,"Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne."
182,Ross,Why is this here?
183,Phoebe,Ross...
184,Ross,I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!
185,Ross,All
186,Ross,This is the single greatest day of my professional career.
187,Ross,"Gunther, six glasses!"
188,Ross,"Oh, I thought Joey was here."
189,Ross,Five is good.
190,Ross,"Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow."
191,Chandler,Ooh!
192,Chandler,Israeli champagne.
193,Chandler,And it's vanilla!
194,Ross,I got tenure.
195,Ross,"I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?"
196,Rachel,Oh it... good!
197,Rachel,"Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days."
198,Ross,"Oh, you know what?"
199,Ross,You're gonna get it.
200,Ross,I-I-I-I can feel it.
201,Phoebe,Can you?
202,Rachel,"Ah, all right."
203,Rachel,Here's to Ross!
204,Ross,And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.
205,Phoebe,And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything.
206,Ross,But also knowing it means a lot.
207,Monica,But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.
208,Ross,...that center around work.
209,Chandler,To Ross!
210,Chandler,All
211,Ross,You know what the best part about this is?
212,Ross,I can never be fired.
213,Phoebe,Oh God!
214,Ross,No seriously.
215,Ross,I have job security for life.
216,Ross,"You know, I never have to worry."
217,Ross,"Oh, look at you."
218,Ross,Look  how happy you are for me.
219,Rachel,"No, it's not that."
220,Rachel,I got fired today.
221,Rachel,And I didn't get the other job.
222,Ross,"Rach, I'm so sorry."
223,Rachel,Oh!
224,Ross,Great.
225,Ross,I feel like an idiot.
226,Rachel,"No, it's okay, you didn't know."
227,Ross,Oh...  Little heads-up would have been nice.
228,Monica,Thank you for letting us see the house again.
229,Chandler,And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means...
230,Chandler,"I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you."
231,Monica,"Ah, so glad you decided to come."
232,Joey,Me too.
233,Joey,"Yeah, this place is great."
234,Joey,I'm so happy for you guys.
235,Joey,"Although, you know, I hope you like fungus."
236,Chandler,What?
237,Joey,Fungus!
238,Joey,Yeah.
239,Joey,Place is full of it.
240,Monica,No it's not.
241,Monica,We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.
242,Joey,Okay.
243,Joey,Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.
244,Monica,Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.
245,Joey,Maybe.
246,Joey,So this is the living room huh?
247,Joey,"Ooh, it's pretty dark."
248,Monica,No it's not!
249,Joey,Are you kiddin'?
250,Joey,I think I just saw a bat in the corner!
251,Chandler,"When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?"
252,Joey,Maybe.
253,Joey,"Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know?"
254,Joey,Or any other house for that matter.
255,Monica,"Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here."
256,Joey,"FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay?"
257,Joey,I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound.
258,Joey,Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...
259,Monica,"Joey, we know that's you."
260,Joey,no... hmmmmm... it's not... hmmmmmmmmmm
261,Phoebe,Welcome back!
262,Phoebe,"Oh, me too!"
263,Phoebe,"Well, I'm no longer Phoebe Buffay."
264,Phoebe,Yes I did!
265,Phoebe,Nope.
266,Phoebe,Yep.
267,Phoebe,Why?
268,Phoebe,"It's fun, it's different, no-one else has a name like it."
269,Phoebe,"Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to?"
270,Phoebe,"You're not serious, right?"
271,Phoebe,"Uhu, uhu, well, then, great."
272,Phoebe,"If you love it, I love it."
273,Phoebe,And I love Crap.
274,Joey,Ow!
275,Joey,"Oh, hi, I'm Joey."
276,Joey,My stupid friends are buying this house.
277,Joey,Who are you?
278,Joey,Oh.
279,Joey,I hate my friends.
280,Joey,"Alright, look."
281,Joey,There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening.
282,Joey,Uhm... oh!
283,Joey,Okay.
284,Joey,"You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!"
285,Joey,"Woah, uh!"
286,Joey,"Okay, let's hear your great idea."
287,Joey,Ahh!
288,Joey,There's gotta be a way.
289,Joey,"I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike."
290,Joey,"That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?"
291,Joey,"What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends."
292,Joey,"Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young."
293,Joey,"Me, I'm set in my ways."
294,Joey,"Yeah, yeah, I guess."
295,Joey,"Yeah, maybe."
296,Joey,"I hate to admit it, but you're probably right."
297,Joey,How did you get to be so smart?
298,Joey,Just when I thought we could be friends.
299,Rachel,"Oh, thank you..."
300,Rachel,"Well, now I don't have to."
301,Rachel,"Ross, what is taking you so long?"
302,Ross,"I'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!"
303,Rachel,Mark?
304,Rachel,Oh my God!
305,Rachel,I'm fantastic.
306,Rachel,You remember Ross?
307,Ross,"Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so..."
308,Rachel,"Oh, well,  you're not catching me on my best day."
309,Rachel,"No, but it's good, you know, I'm gonna take some time off and do some charity work."
310,Rachel,"Well, screw charity work."
311,Rachel,What've you got?
312,Rachel,Great!
313,Rachel,I'll call ya!
314,Ross,Yeah!
315,Ross,"yeah, I got tenure!"
316,Rachel,Oh my God!
317,Ross,See?
318,Ross,I told you something good would come along.
319,Ross,And he seemed really nice.
320,Ross,I've met him before?
321,Rachel,Ross!
322,Rachel,That's Mark.
323,Rachel,From Bloomingdales?
324,Rachel,You were insanely jealous of him.
325,Ross,That is Mark?
326,Rachel,Yes.
327,Ross,I hate that guy.
328,Rachel,Oh.
329,Ross,"No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him."
330,Rachel,What?
331,Rachel,You don't want me to get a job?
332,Ross,"Oh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job."
333,Ross,Maybe make you his SEXretary.
334,Rachel,Ugh.
335,Ross,I'm serious.
336,Ross,"I just don't trust that guy, okay?"
337,Rachel,"Ross, you know what?"
338,Rachel,"Okay, let's talk about it later, there comes security."
339,Monica,"Oh, I love this street."
340,Monica,"The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences."
341,Chandler,"Man, those two dogs are going at it!"
342,Joey,Hey!
343,Chandler,Hey.
344,Monica,"Hey, where have you been?"
345,Joey,"Oh, just er... you know, looking around."
346,Joey,But you know what?
347,Joey,This house... is great.
348,Chandler,Really?
349,Chandler,What changed your mind?
350,Joey,"Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing."
351,Chandler,"Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago."
352,Joey,What?
353,Chandler,Ha!
354,Chandler,I'm just messing with you.
355,Joey,That's not funny!
356,Joey,You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts!
357,Monica,"Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?"
358,Joey,What?
359,Joey,I get my own room?
360,Chandler,You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
361,Joey,Oh my God!
362,Joey,Oh!
363,Joey,"Hey, can I have an aquarium?"
364,Joey,And a sex swing?
365,Joey,Chandler and
366,Monica,No!
367,Joey,Why not?
368,Joey,I'll keep the tank clean.
369,Phoebe,"Thank you, mister Bag."
370,Phoebe,Oh hi Rita!
371,Phoebe,Good!
372,Phoebe,"Oh, Rita's a massage client."
373,Phoebe,"Er, Rita, this is my husband."
374,Phoebe,Yeah.
375,Phoebe,"Okay, I will."
376,Phoebe,This is my husband Crap Bag.
377,Phoebe,Yeah... Ogh...
378,Phoebe,"Okay, fine."
379,Phoebe,You made your point.
380,Phoebe,Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again?
381,Phoebe,How about uhm... How about Buffay-Hannigan?
382,Phoebe,Yeah.
383,Phoebe,I'm Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan Banana Hammock.
384,Phoebe,It's a funny word.
385,Phoebe,...Oh crap!
386,Ross,"Hey, is Rachel here?"
387,Monica,No.
388,Ross,She's still at dinner?
389,Monica,I guess.
390,Monica,Why?
391,Monica,Who's she with?
392,Ross,That guy Mark.
393,Ross,From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her.
394,Ross,But I know he really wants to sleep with her.
395,Chandler,It's seven years ago.
396,Chandler,My time machine works!
397,Ross,We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her.
398,Ross,But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
399,Monica,So what if he wants to sleep with her?
400,Monica,"I mean, she's single and he's cute."
401,Chandler,Excuse me?
402,Monica,Oh please!
403,Monica,Yesterday on the subway?
404,Monica,You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.
405,Chandler,"For your information, I was staring at her baby."
406,Chandler,We're about to be parents.
407,Monica,"Oh, sorry!"
408,Rachel,Hi you guys!
409,Ross,"Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?"
410,Rachel,"Oh, it was great."
411,Rachel,Mark is so sweet.
412,Ross,Oh yeah?
413,Ross,Yeah?
414,Ross,I wonder why?
415,Ross,What could that smarmy letch possibly want?
416,Rachel,"Oh Ross, come on."
417,Rachel,He's happily married.
418,Rachel,His wife just had twins.
419,Ross,Should we send something?
420,Chandler,How did the job stuff go?
421,Rachel,He offered me one.
422,Chandler,That's great!
423,Ross,Congratulations!
424,Rachel,"I know, it's amazing."
425,Rachel,It's amazing.
426,Rachel,It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren.
427,Rachel,The money is great...
428,Ross,"Can we, can we just stop for a second?"
429,Ross,"Who said something better would come along, huh?"
430,Ross,You didn't believe me.
431,Ross,I told you everything was gonna work out.
432,Ross,You know what?
433,Ross,This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
434,Rachel,The job is in Paris.
435,Rachel,COMMERCIAL BREAK
436,Joey,"I mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am I missing opportunities?"
437,Joey,"You know, I've always thought of myself as a serious actor."
438,Joey,"I mean, should I be trying to do more independent movies?"
439,Joey,"Hey bear, I need some career advice."
440,Joey,THE END
