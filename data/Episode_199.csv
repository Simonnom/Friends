10,Monica,"Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine"
11,Phoebe,Yes!!!
12,Phoebe,Oh!
13,Rachel,Hypothetically!
14,Phoebe,Still.
15,Monica,If Phoebe were my maid of honor
16,Rachel,Uh-hmm.
17,Monica,"Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset."
18,Rachel,Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea.
19,Phoebe,"Yeah, I'll do that."
20,Phoebe,So who gets to be yours?
21,Monica,Well that's the best part.

24,Monica,Because then I don't have to!
25,Rachel,Well of course we will help you decide!
26,Rachel,We will do anything we can to help you!

110,Chandler,"So uh, what did this woman look like?"
111,Monica,"She was like 30, dark hair, attractive."
112,Chandler,"Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?"
113,Monica,"Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?"
114,Chandler,"No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive  Hold on one second; let me check this out."

144,Rachel,All right that's it!
145,Rachel,I am maid of honor!
146,Phoebe,"Na-uh, I am!"
147,Rachel,How come you are?
148,Phoebe,Because I cared enough to lie!
149,Joey,"Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it!"
150,Joey,"Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you'd handle maid of honor type situations."
151,Phoebe,What are you talking about?
152,Joey,"Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see, they give me the part."
153,Phoebe,"Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?"
154,Joey,"Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges."
155,Phoebe,"Well, it's better than us deciding."
156,Rachel,"Oh, come on!"
157,Rachel,This is crazy!
158,Rachel,Can't we just flip a coin?
159,Phoebe,No!
160,Phoebe,Coins hate me!

175,Ross,I I don't know what you are talking about.
176,Joey,Come on!
177,Joey,Admit it!
178,Joey,That was the best nap you ever had!
179,Ross,I've had better.
180,Joey,Okay!
181,Joey,When?
182,Ross,All right!
183,Ross,All right!
184,Ross,It was the best nap ever!
185,Joey,Uh-huh!
186,Ross,I've said it!
187,Ross,Okay?!
188,Ross,But it's over Joey!
189,Joey,I want to do it again.
190,Ross,We can't do it again.
191,Joey,Why not?
192,Ross,Because it's weird!
193,Joey,Fine!
194,Joey,Do you want something to drink?
195,Ross,"Sure, what do you got?"
196,Joey,Warm milk and Excedrin P.M.  Commercial Break
197,Monica,Chandler!
198,Monica,Chandler!
199,Monica,I just figured out who you are!
200,Chandler,Can you figure out what I'm doing?
201,Monica,You're Lewis Posin.
202,Chandler,Who?
203,Monica,Lewis Posin!
204,Monica,"He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no."
205,Monica,Do you know why?
206,Chandler,Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?
207,Monica,No!
208,Monica,But because he thought I was to faaaaa.
209,Monica,"And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade!"
210,Monica,"Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie."
211,Chandler,What?
212,Chandler,Are you kidding?
213,Chandler,That was like 16 years ago.
214,Monica,"No, I know."
215,Monica,But y'know what?
216,Monica,It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
217,Chandler,"Okay, I will do it."
218,Chandler,But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
219,Joey,"Okay, all right, this is how it's going to work."
220,Joey,"We're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest."
221,Ross,"No, 10 is the highest."
222,Joey,Why is 10 the highest?
223,Ross,Because it's the highest.
224,Ross,"Okay, Rachel you're up first."
225,Ross,Situation No.
226,Joey,I don't want to marry Chandler!
227,Rachel,"Okay, uh"
228,Joey,I've got cold feet.
229,Rachel,it's gonna be okay!
230,Joey,"No, one man for the rest of my life?"
231,Joey,I don't know if I can do it!
232,Joey,This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey!
233,Rachel,"Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common."
234,Rachel,"Y'know, it's-it's just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler."
235,Rachel,"And also, I ran out on a wedding."
236,Rachel,You don't get to keep the gifts.
237,Joey,Very good!
238,Joey,"Drawing on your own experience, I like that!"
239,Rachel,Thanks!
240,Ross,"Yes, very nice Rachel."
241,Rachel,Thank you judges.
242,Phoebe,"Ugh, what a kiss ass."
243,Rachel,Oh!
244,Joey,"Okay, Phoebe"
245,Phoebe,Yes!
246,Phoebe,Your honor?
247,Joey,"We're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, ""I do"" when her drunk uncle starts yelling."
248,Joey,What do you do?
249,Joey,Go!
250,Ross,"When Monica was a little girl, I remember thatOoh!!"
251,Ross,Ow!
252,Ross,Very good!
253,Phoebe,Oh!
254,Joey,Yes!
255,Joey,Excellent!
256,Joey,Perfect score!
257,Rachel,Wait a minute!
258,Rachel,She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
259,Phoebe,Hey!
260,Phoebe,Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?
261,Ross,It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
262,Rachel,"Ohh, wait a minute, we haven't pre"
263,Ross,Go!
264,Rachel,Okay!
265,Rachel,Okay!
266,Rachel,"Umm, Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as  Okay!!"
267,Rachel,Forget that!
268,Rachel,That sucks!!
269,Rachel,"Okay, never mind!"
270,Rachel,Forget it!
271,Rachel,"Umm, umm, okay, uh I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old."
272,Rachel,Ross and
273,Joey,Oh!
274,Joey,That's nice.
275,Rachel,Thank you.
276,Rachel,Thank you very much.
277,Rachel,"Umm, I've known them separately and I've known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love."
278,Rachel,So I would like to raise my glass  to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together.
279,Rachel,I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
280,Joey,Wow.
281,Joey,Good speech.
282,Ross,"Yeah, it really was!"
283,Rachel,"Aw, thanks!"
284,Ross,"Okay Phoebe, I guess you're next  although I really don't see the point."
285,Joey,Yeah.
286,Phoebe,"Okay, I can't believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married."
287,Phoebe,"I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked."
288,Joey,And she's back in the game.
289,Chandler,Julie hi!
290,Chandler,"Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me."
291,Chandler,"It's a nickname, I'll explain later."
292,Monica,It's pretty clear.
293,Chandler,"Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology."
294,Chandler,I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
295,Chandler,You-you-you didn't know that.
296,Chandler,"Well, I guess my work here is done!"
297,Joey,"All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well."
298,Joey,Okay?
299,Joey,You should be proud of yourselves.
300,Joey,And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers.
301,Joey,"Well, except for RachelDamnit!"
302,Phoebe,Really?!
303,Phoebe,I won!
304,Rachel,What?
305,Ross,"I'm sorry Rach, it was, it was really close."
306,Rachel,Well then I demand a recount!
307,Ross,"Actually, it wasn't that close."
308,Rachel,No!
309,Rachel,Y'know what?
310,Rachel,No!
311,Rachel,No!
312,Rachel,"You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculousWe're gonna flip a coin!"
313,Rachel,All right?!
314,Rachel,Heads!
315,Phoebe,The coins have finally forgiven me!
316,Rachel,Well y'know what?
317,Rachel,"I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower!"
318,Phoebe,"Rach, it's gonna be okay!"
319,Phoebe,You guys are the best!
320,Joey,"Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me."
321,Ross,Yeah?
322,Joey,Yeah!
323,Joey,I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
324,Ross,Why-why would I care about that?
325,Joey,"No reason, I'm just saying that uh That's where I'll be."
326,Chandler,As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself.
327,Chandler,I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
328,Monica,Why don't you just stop doing stupid things?
329,Monica,Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
330,Chandler,I would really love it if could do both.
331,Monica,"All right, II have to ask."
332,Chandler,What?
333,Monica,Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
334,Chandler,What?
335,Monica,"Well, you broke up with Julie Grath!"
336,Monica,How much weight could she have gained?
337,Chandler,A hundred and forty-five pounds.
338,Monica,In one year?!
339,Monica,My God what did she eat?
340,Monica,Her-her family!
341,Monica,That's not the point.
342,Chandler,"Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!"
343,Monica,Well That's not the only time this was an issue.
344,Monica,"You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us?"
345,Monica,You called me fat.
346,Chandler,Okay.
347,Chandler,"Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different."
348,Monica,How?
349,Chandler,You were not supposed to hear that!
350,Chandler,I said that behind you back!
351,Monica,"What if I have babies, okay?"
352,Monica,I mean I'm gonna look different.
353,Monica,"I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!"
354,Chandler,"Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman."
355,Chandler,See this is one of things that I can apologize for later!
356,Chandler,"Look, what I mean is you're Monica!"
357,Chandler,Okay?
358,Chandler,And I am in love with Monica.
359,Monica,Keep going.
360,Chandler,So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
361,Monica,Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
362,Chandler,I'd carry you around in my pocket.
363,Monica,I love you.
364,Chandler,Skidmark's still got a way with the ladies.
365,Rachel,Hi Pheebs.
366,Phoebe,Hi!
367,Rachel,Hi!
368,Rachel,I just want to apologize.
369,Rachel,I'm really sorry I was a baby.
370,Phoebe,"That's ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once."
371,Phoebe,"Oh, you mean today."
372,Rachel,Yeah.
373,Rachel,"Yeah, and y'know you-you deserve to win."
374,Rachel,"And-and y'know I was thinking about it, if-if you're Monica's maid of honor that means I get to be yours."
375,Phoebe,Oh yeah!
376,Rachel,Yeah!
377,Rachel,"Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y'know just in case"
378,Phoebe,Oh that's so sweet thanks.
379,Rachel,Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves.
380,Rachel,"And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride."
381,Rachel,"And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman."
382,Rachel,Oh and here's a little purse that I found.
383,Rachel,Y'know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
384,Phoebe,Ohh.
385,Rachel,"And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y'know cause, people cry at weddings."
386,Rachel,I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.
387,Phoebe,This stuff is great!
388,Rachel,"Oh, I forgot this was in here."
389,Rachel,"Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica's something borrowed and it's blue."
390,Rachel,Yeah
391,Phoebe,"Y'know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica's made of honor."
392,Rachel,You do?
393,Rachel,Why?
394,Phoebe,Because I think it means more to you.
395,Rachel,"But Pheebs, y'know you earned it."
396,Phoebe,Its fine.
397,Phoebe,"I mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14?"
398,Rachel,"No, I was ten."
399,Rachel,I just developed early.
400,Phoebe,Man alive!
401,Monica,"Hey, what's going on?"
402,Rachel,Hey!
403,Phoebe,"Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor."
404,Monica,"Ohh, wow!"
405,Monica,That's great!
406,Monica,Oh wow!
407,Monica,We really have to start planning!
408,Monica,"I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas!"
409,Monica,We should probably get together like four times per week.
410,Monica,You can come over to my place; we'll get together before work!
411,Monica,"What do you say,"
412,Rachel,"Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she's gonna be yours."
413,Rachel,Ending Credits
414,Joey,Great nap.
415,Ross,It really was.
