1,Joey,Thank you.
2,Rachel,Cappuccino.
3,Ross,Grazie.
4,Rachel,And a nice hot cider for Monica.
5,Monica,"Aww, thank you."
6,Monica,Uh Rach?
7,Rachel,Yeah?
8,Monica,Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
9,Rachel,Oh!
10,Rachel,That's why.
11,Rachel,I'm sorry!
12,Rachel,Opening Credits
13,Chandler,Mrs. Tedlock.
14,Chandler,You're looking lovely today.
15,Chandler,"And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you."
16,Chandler,Mrs.
17,Chandler,"Oh, listen."
18,Chandler,"If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them."
19,Chandler,Really.
20,Chandler,Nothing at all.
21,Chandler,Really.
22,Chandler,Nothing.
23,Phoebe,Hey you guys!
24,Phoebe,"Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know..."
25,Chandler,Hey!
26,Phoebe,Never mind.
27,Phoebe,But it was going to be really good.
28,Ross,What's going on?
29,Chandler,"So, it's a typical day at work."
30,Chandler,"I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor."
31,Chandler,So....
32,Chandler,I quit.
33,Chandler,Why?
34,Chandler,This was supposed to be a temp job!
35,Monica,"Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years."
36,Chandler,"If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do."
37,Phoebe,So was it a lot more money?
38,Chandler,It doesn't matter.
39,Chandler,I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
40,Rachel,... the WENUS?
41,Chandler,Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems.
42,Chandler,A processing term.
43,Rachel,Oh.
44,Rachel,That WENUS.
45,Joey,So what're you going to do?
46,Chandler,I don't know.
47,Chandler,That's the thing.
48,Chandler,I don't know what I want to do.
49,Chandler,I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
50,Phoebe,Oooh!
51,Phoebe,I have something you can do!
52,Phoebe,I have this new massage client... Steve?
53,Phoebe,"Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef."
54,Monica,Um... hi there.
55,Phoebe,Hi!
56,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah, no, I know."
57,Phoebe,You're a chef.
58,Phoebe,"I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so...."
59,Chandler,Yeah...
60,Chandler,I just don't have that much cheffing experience.
61,Chandler,Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
62,Phoebe,"Yeah, yeah!"
63,Monica,"Well, what kind of food is he looking for?"
64,Phoebe,"Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu."
65,Monica,Oh my God!
66,Phoebe,"Yeah, I know!"
67,Phoebe,"So, what do you think?"
68,Chandler,"Thanks, Phoebe."
69,Chandler,But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
70,Phoebe,OK.  Oh Monica!
71,Phoebe,Guess what!
72,Chandler,Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
73,Rachel,No.
74,Rachel,"But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there."
75,Phoebe,"Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?"
76,Chandler,"Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo."
77,Chandler,"I added the ""a-gogo."""
78,Rachel,Career counselor?
79,Chandler,"Hey, you guys all know what you want to do."
80,Rachel,I don't!
81,Chandler,"Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do."
82,Chandler,"You know, you have goals."
83,Chandler,You have dreams.
84,Chandler,I don't have a dream.
85,Ross,"Ah, the lesser-known ""I don't have a dream"" speech."
86,Monica,"Oh, I love my life, I love my life!"
87,Phoebe,Ooh!
88,Phoebe,Brian's Song!
89,Rachel,The meeting with the guy went great?
90,Monica,So great!
91,Monica,He showed me where the restaurant's going to be.
92,Monica,"It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street."
93,Monica,"Not too big, not too small."
94,Monica,Just right.
95,Chandler,Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
96,Monica,"So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night."
97,Monica,"You know, kind of like an audition."
98,Monica,"And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises."
99,Rachel,What are you going to make?
100,Phoebe,Yummy noises.
101,Rachel,"And Monica, what are you going to make?"
102,Monica,I don't know.
103,Monica,I don't know.
104,Monica,It's just going to be so great!
105,Phoebe,Ooh!
106,Phoebe,I know what you could make!
107,Phoebe,I know!
108,Phoebe,"Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff?"
109,Phoebe,"You know, that thing... with the stuff...?"
110,Phoebe,"OK, I don't know."
111,Ross,"Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?"
112,Joey,How about Tony's?
113,Joey,"If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free."
114,Ross,"OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?"
115,Chandler,Who are you going out with?
116,Phoebe,"Oh, is this the bug lady?"
117,Rachel,Bzzzz....
118,Rachel,"I love you, Ross."
119,Ross,Her name is Celia.
120,Ross,She's not a bug lady.
121,Ross,She's curator of insects at the museum.
122,Rachel,So what are you guys going to do?
123,Ross,"Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey."
124,Chandler,And he's not speaking metaphorically.
125,Joey,"So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe...  huh-huh?"
126,Ross,"Well, I don't know....  huh-huh.... but I'm hoping  huh-huh."
127,Joey,"I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet!"
128,Joey,"She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal."
129,Ross,"Celia, don't worry!"
130,Ross,Don't scream!
131,Ross,He's not going to hurt you!
132,Ross,"Soothing tones, Celia."
133,Ross,Soothing tones!
134,Ross,Marcel...
135,Ross,Alright...
136,Monica,"OK, try this salmon mousse."
137,Joey,Mmmm.
138,Joey,Good.
139,Monica,Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
140,Joey,It's creamier.
141,Monica,"Yeah, well, is that better?"
142,Joey,I don't know.
143,Joey,"We're talking about whipped fish, Monica."
144,Joey,"I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?"
145,Rachel,My God!
146,Rachel,What happened to you?
147,Chandler,"Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?"
148,Chandler,"""You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."""
149,Phoebe,That's so great!
150,Phoebe,'Cause you already know how to do that!
151,Chandler,Can you believe it?
152,Chandler,"I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool?"
153,Chandler,"You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something."
154,Rachel,"Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey!"
155,Rachel,You can see your nipples through this shirt!
156,Monica,"Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up."
157,Chandler,"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you."
158,Monica,It's supposed to be that small.
159,Monica,It's a pre-appetizer.
160,Monica,The French call it an amouz-bouche.
161,Chandler,Well.... it is amouz-ing...
162,Monica,Hello?
163,Monica,"Oh, hi Wendy!"
164,Monica,"Yeah, eight o'clock."
165,Monica,What did we say?
166,Monica,Ten dollars an hour?...
167,Monica,"OK, great."
168,Monica,"All right, I'll see you then."
169,Monica,Bye.
170,Phoebe,Ten dollars an hour for what?
171,Monica,"Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out."
172,Rachel,Waitressing?
173,Joey,Uh-oh.
174,Monica,Well... of course I thought of you!
175,Monica,But... but...
176,Rachel,"But, but?"
177,Monica,"But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know?"
178,Monica,"And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress."
179,Rachel,Oh!
180,Rachel,I see.
181,Rachel,And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
182,Chandler,"You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76."
183,Chandler,Amouz-bouche?
184,Ross,"OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning..."
185,Ross,"Wha... what, here?"
186,Ross,Ah....
187,Ross,Er.... um.....
188,Ross,Um... uh.... vulva.
189,Ross,Commercial Break
190,Joey,Vulva?
191,Ross,"Alright, I panicked, alright?"
192,Ross,She took me by surprise.
193,Ross,"You know, but it wasn't a total loss."
194,Ross,"I mean, we ended up cuddling."
195,Joey,Whoaa!!
196,Joey,You cuddled?
197,Joey,How many times?
198,Ross,Shut up!
199,Ross,It was nice.
200,Ross,I just...
201,Ross,"I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?"
202,Joey,What's the big deal?
203,Joey,You just say what you want to do to her.
204,Joey,Or what you want her to do to you.
205,Joey,Or what you think other people might be doing to each other.
206,Joey,I'll tell you what.
207,Joey,Just try something on me.
208,Ross,Please be kidding.
209,Joey,Why not?
210,Joey,Come on!
211,Joey,"Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now."
212,Ross,OK.
213,Ross,I'm in my apartment...
214,Joey,....yeah... what else?
215,Ross,That's it.
216,Ross,"I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation."
217,Joey,"Alright, look, I'll start, OK?"
218,Ross,"Joey, please."
219,Joey,Come on.
220,Joey,Come on.
221,Joey,"Alright, ready, look!"
222,Joey,Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot.
223,Joey,I want your lips on me now.
224,Ross,Wow.
225,Joey,"Alright, now you say something."
226,Ross,I... ahem...
227,Ross,I really don't think so.
228,Joey,Come on!
229,Joey,"You like this woman, right?"
230,Ross,Yeah.
231,Joey,"You want to see her again, right?"
232,Ross,Sure.
233,Joey,"Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her?"
234,Joey,Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
235,Ross,"OK, turn around."
236,Ross,I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
237,Joey,"Alright, alright."
238,Joey,I'm around.
239,Joey,Go ahead.
240,Ross,Ahem...
241,Ross,"I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips."
242,Joey,There you go!
243,Joey,Keep going.
244,Joey,Keep going!
245,Ross,"I, er..."
246,Ross,I want to take my tongue... and...
247,Ross,....and....
248,Joey,Say it... say it!
249,Ross,...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
250,Chandler,....with?
251,Ross,Funny story!
252,Joey,You're not going to believe this!
253,Chandler,It's OK.
254,Chandler,It's OK.
255,Chandler,I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
256,Joey,"Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again."
257,Chandler,Again?
258,Joey,"And again, and again, and again...  Hello?"
259,Joey,And again.
260,Chandler,Hey Mr. Kostelic!
261,Chandler,How's life on the fifteenth floor?
262,Chandler,"Yeah, I miss you too."
263,Chandler,"Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know?"
264,Chandler,"Well, that's very generous  er, but look, this isn't about the money."
265,Chandler,I need something that's more than a job.
266,Chandler,I need something I can really care about....  And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier?
267,Chandler,"Look, Al, Al..."
268,Chandler,"I'm not playing hardball here, OK?"
269,Chandler,"This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection!"
270,Chandler,No!
271,Chandler,No!
272,Chandler,"No, stop saying numbers!"
273,Chandler,"I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy!"
274,Chandler,You've got the wrong guy!
275,Chandler,I'll see you on Monday!
276,Chandler,Well?
277,Phoebe,Wow!
278,Phoebe,It's huge!
279,Phoebe,It's so much bigger than the cubicle.
280,Phoebe,"Oh, this is a cube."
281,Chandler,Look at this!
282,Phoebe,Oh!
283,Phoebe,You have a window!
284,Chandler,Yes indeedy!
285,Chandler,With a beautiful view of...
286,Phoebe,Oh look!
287,Phoebe,That guy's peeing!
288,Chandler,"OK, that's enough of the view."
289,Chandler,"Check this out, look at this."
290,Chandler,"Sit down, sit down."
291,Phoebe,OK.
292,Chandler,This is great!
293,Chandler,"Helen, could you come in here for a moment?"
294,Chandler,"Thank you Helen, that'll be all."
295,Chandler,"Last time I do that, I promise."
296,Monica,"Wendy, we had a deal!"
297,Monica,"Yeah, you promised!"
298,Monica,Wendy!
299,Monica,Wendy!
300,Monica,Wendy!
301,Rachel,Who was that?
302,Monica,Wendy bailed.
303,Monica,I have no waitress.
304,Rachel,Oh... that's too bad.
305,Rachel,Bye bye.
306,Monica,Ten dollars an hour.
307,Rachel,No.
308,Monica,Twelve dollars an hour.
309,Rachel,Mon.
310,Rachel,"I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around."
311,Monica,"You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you."
312,Monica,"I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you...  twenty dollars an hour."
313,Rachel,Done.
314,Rachel,Well hello!
315,Rachel,Welcome to Monica's.
316,Rachel,May I take your coat?
317,Monica,Hi Steve!
318,Monica,This is Rachel.
319,Phoebe,Mmmmmm!
320,Phoebe,Everything smells so delicious!
321,Phoebe,"You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of  of, OK, smells."
322,Monica,"Oh, thank you."
323,Monica,Would you like a tour?
324,Rachel,What's up?
325,Phoebe,"In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie."
326,Rachel,What?
327,Phoebe,Smoked a joint?
328,Phoebe,"You know, lit a bone?"
329,Phoebe,Weed?
330,Phoebe,Hemp?
331,Phoebe,Ganja?
332,Rachel,"OK, OK."
333,Rachel,"I'm with you, Cheech."
334,Rachel,OK.
335,Rachel,"Let me, let me get you some wine!"
336,Monica,"Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course."
337,Monica,"OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger."
338,Monica,I'm so glad you liked them!
339,Monica,"Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these."
340,Monica,"But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets."
341,Rachel,Excuse me?
342,Rachel,Can I help you with anything?
343,Monica,You know that?
344,Monica,You don't want to spoil your appetite.
345,Monica,"You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes..."
346,Monica,"No, we don't."
347,Monica,Why don't you just have a seat here?
348,Monica,OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
349,Monica,Give them to me.
350,Monica,"No, give me the..."
351,Monica,That's it!
352,Monica,Dinner is over!
353,Monica,What?
354,Monica,Why?
355,Monica,"It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?"
356,Joey,What a tool!
357,Rachel,You don't want to work for a guy like that.
358,Ross,Yeah!
359,Monica,I know... it's just...
360,Monica,"I thought this was, you know... it."
361,Ross,"Look, you'll get there."
362,Ross,You're an amazing chef.
363,Phoebe,Yeah!
364,Phoebe,You know all those yummy noises?
365,Phoebe,I wasn't faking.
366,Joey,"So, er... how did it go with Celia?"
367,Ross,"Oh, I was unbelievable."
368,Joey,"All right, Ross!"
369,Ross,I was the James Michener of dirty talk.
370,Ross,It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard.
371,Ross,"I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers."
372,Joey,Whoa!
373,Joey,And the...  huh-huh?
374,Ross,"Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh..."
375,Joey,You cuddled.
376,Ross,"Yeah, which was nice."
377,Phoebe,You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
378,Rachel,"Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?"
379,Joey,"Yeah, where the hell is he?"
380,Chandler,"Yes, Fran."
381,Chandler,"I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!..."
382,Chandler,"Oh, really, really, really?"
383,Chandler,"Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it!"
384,Chandler,You got it?
385,Chandler,Good!
386,Chandler,Whooooaaaa....
387,Chandler,Closing Credits
388,Phoebe,How's this?
389,Phoebe,Sorry.
390,Phoebe,How about over here?
391,Phoebe,"See, that just means it's working."
392,Phoebe,Does this hurt?
393,Phoebe,What about this?
394,Phoebe,There you go!
395,Phoebe,End
