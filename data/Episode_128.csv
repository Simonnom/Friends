,Person,Said
0,Chandler,How did the job stuff go?
1,Rachel,He offered me one.
2,Ross,You know what?
3,Ross,This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
4,Rachel,The job is in Paris.
5,Rachel,FADE OUT
6,Rachel,"Oh, God!"
7,Rachel,"Please, somebody  say something."
8,Ross,So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?
9,Chandler,Or facing a bitch of a commute.
10,Rachel,"I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away    from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me."
11,Rachel,"And I've already    talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever    we need to make us feel comfortable."
12,Ross,Okay.
13,Rachel,"I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out..."
14,Rachel,Anything we want.
15,Chandler,My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle.
16,Ross,"All right, we'll work it out."
17,Rachel,Thank you!
18,Rachel,Thank you!
19,Ross,"Yeah, yeah!"
20,Ross,You sure this is what you want?
21,Rachel,I think it is.
22,Phoebe,"Ooh, what's going on?"
23,Rachel,I got a really incredible job offer.
24,Joey,"Hey, great!"
25,Joey,All right!
26,Phoebe,Good for you!
27,Rachel,It's in Paris.
28,Joey,What?
29,Joey,"No, no, no!"
30,Joey,"No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing,    okay?"
31,Joey,"First, Phoebe getting married  Congratulations!"
32,Joey,... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid    suburbs...
33,Monica,"Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive..."
34,Joey,"Well, it comes and goes."
35,Joey,I wouldn't trust it.
36,Rachel,"Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me."
37,Rachel,And it means    a lot if you could try to get on board.
38,Phoebe,Of course we can.
39,Phoebe,Congratulations.
40,Phoebe,Yay!
41,Phoebe,Joey...
42,Joey,"No, no, no."
43,Joey,My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.
44,Rachel,"Joey, it would mean so..."
45,Joey,Hey!
46,Joey,No!
47,Joey,Get your France-going-arms away from me.
48,Rachel,Joey...
49,Phoebe,You okay with this?
50,Chandler,"Well, it makes me feel sad, but..."
51,Phoebe,Talking to Ross.
52,Chandler,I see.
53,Ross,"Well, Rachel moving to another country?"
54,Ross,Not being able to see her every    day.
55,Ross,How can I be okay with this?
56,Monica,"I know, but what are we gonna do?"
57,Monica,She really needs this job.
58,Ross,"Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back,    she would take it?"
59,Monica,How is that gonna happen?
60,Chandler,Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
61,Ross,I don't know.
62,Ross,I could talk to her boss.
63,Ross,Yeah!
64,Ross,I met him at that Christmas    party.
65,Ross,We really hit it off.
66,Monica,You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?
67,Ross,I didn't say we were brothers.
68,Ross,OPENING CREDITS
69,Monica,Hey Phoebe.
70,Monica,"Hey, tell me what you think."
71,Monica,All right.
72,Monica,The house next    door to the one that we're buying in Westchester?
73,Monica,Just went on the market.
74,Monica,"I wanna    take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't."
75,Chandler,"We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse    us, and we're easily confused."
76,Chandler,We're not very bright.
77,Monica,But what if it is better than ours?
78,Monica,Should we at least look?
79,Chandler,What do you think Pheebs?
80,Phoebe,"Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin    Robbins..."
81,Phoebe,"Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?"
82,Chandler,Yeah.
83,Phoebe,She died.
84,Chandler,You're kidding!
85,Monica,That's terrible!
86,Phoebe,"Yeah, last Saturday."
87,Phoebe,Wow!
88,Phoebe,She was the first black man to fly solo across    the Atlantic.
89,Phoebe,"Oh, wait a minute, I read the    wrong one."
90,Chandler,Oh yeah?
91,Phoebe,"Yeah, she was just an agent."
92,Monica,Joey's gonna be *so* upset.
93,Chandler,I know.
94,Chandler,*He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the    Atlantic.
95,Phoebe,"Well, we cannot tell Joey about this."
96,Phoebe,He's already flipping out about    everything that's changing.
97,Phoebe,This will push him over the edge.
98,Monica,"Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?"
99,Phoebe,"Well, not for a little while."
100,Phoebe,Let's just give him a few days to get    used to everything else.
101,Monica,What if he reads it in the paper?
102,Chandler,"Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay."
103,Ross,"Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's."
104,Ross,"Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas    party about two years ago."
105,Ross,Mr
106,Ross,Close.
107,Ross,Ron.
108,Ross,Mr
109,Ross,"Uhm, well..."
110,Ross,I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.
111,Ross,Mr
112,Ross,"Oh, no."
113,Ross,At first I have to get you to agree.
114,Ross,Then we'll    see if she wants to come back.
115,Ross,Mr
116,Ross,"Look, she loved her job here."
117,Ross,And let's face
118,Ross,"Huh, I took a shot there."
119,Ross,Mr
120,Ross,I see...
121,Ross,Thanks very much.
122,Ross,Is this your son?
123,Ross,Mr
124,Ross,"Oh, nothing, it’s just, it’s close to Ron."
125,Ross,Does he..
126,Ross,Does    little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?
127,Ross,Mr
128,Ross,"How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after    everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants."
129,Ross,I just heard it as you must have heard it and that’s    not good.
130,Ross,Let me start again.
131,Ross,"I’m a paleontologist, you’ll be there    with us and the touching refers only to bones… fossils!"
132,Ross,Mr
133,Ross,"You let Rachel come back, and it’s done."
134,Ross,Mr
135,Ross,Yeah!
136,Ross,Yes!
137,Ross,Thank you!
138,Ross,This is great.
139,Ross,Thank you so much.
140,Ross,"And I swear,    your kid is going to have the time of his life."
141,Ross,Mr
142,Ross,He’ll be fine.
143,Joey,Hey Phoebe.
144,Phoebe,Hey.
145,Phoebe,Everything ok?
146,Joey,I’m just mad at my agent.
147,Phoebe,Estelle?
148,Phoebe,Why?
149,Joey,There’s a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I    didn’t even be put up for it!
150,Joey,She’d better have a good reason.
151,Phoebe,I’m guessing she does.
152,Joey,"Well  I’m wanna hear it,    because she keeps doing this."
153,Phoebe,"Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait."
154,Phoebe,"All right, I gotta go."
155,Phoebe,Just listen.
156,Phoebe,"Promise me, that you    will wait a minute before you call her."
157,Joey,Ok. Why?
158,Phoebe,Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.
159,Joey,I love that saying!
160,Joey,Hello?
161,Joey,Phoebe
162,Joey,I was just gonna call you!
163,Joey,That’s weird.
164,Joey,Phoebe-Estelle
165,Joey,"Yeah, actually I am!"
166,Joey,Phoebe-Estelle
167,Joey,That’s it?
168,Joey,"You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball."
169,Joey,Phoebe-Estelle
170,Joey,"No, no, look."
171,Joey,"All I’m saying is that you’re my agent, ok?"
172,Joey,And you’re not getting me into any auditions and I’m tired of it.
173,Joey,Phoebe-Estelle
174,Joey,I’m saying that… .
175,Joey,"This isn't  working for me    anymore, ok?"
176,Joey,"Estelle, you’re fired."
177,Joey,Goodbye.
178,Phoebe,"Man, tough week for Estelle!"
179,Ross,Hi.
180,Rachel,Hi.
181,Ross,Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house.
182,Ross,You know she can’t sleep    without it.
183,Rachel,"Oh, well, she’s asleep now."
184,Rachel,Stop forcing that thing on her.
185,Ross,Ok.
186,Rachel,"Oh, you’re not gonna believe what happened to me today!"
187,Rachel,"Ralph    Lauren called, and gave me my job back!"
188,Ross,Nooo!
189,Rachel,Yee.
190,Rachel,"I mean, it was so weirdest thing."
191,Rachel,They fired me and then out    of nowhere they just hire me back!
192,Rachel,"I mean, that place must have been falling    apart without me."
193,Ross,"So, you’re not going to Paris."
194,Rachel,"No, I’m still going."
195,Ross,Wh… wh…what?
196,Rachel,"When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back,    the offered me more money!"
197,Rachel,Isn’t that great?
198,Ross,Yeeeah!
199,Monica,Hi.
200,Monica,"We’re buying the house next door, and we were wondering if we  could just take a look around."
201,Monica,Thanks.
202,Chandler,It feels like we’re cheating on our house.
203,Chandler,"And if we’re gonna cheat, shouldn’t it be with like a hot, younger house,    that does stuff that our house won’t do?"
204,Monica,Ours is so much better!
205,Monica,"This living room is smaller, the dining room looks    like a cave!"
206,Monica,What a hole!
207,Monica,Love it!
208,Monica,"They could be our neighbors, what are they like?"
209,Phoebe,"Hey Joey, want come with me to… are you ok?"
210,Joey,"Yeah, I just… I just feel bad about firing Estelle."
211,Joey,This is got to be    killing her.
212,Phoebe,"No, that wouldn’t kill her."
213,Phoebe,Ordinary embolism might.
214,Joey,I don’t know.
215,Joey,"She’s got to be taking it hard, I was like    her only client."
216,Joey,Except for this guy who eats paper.
217,Joey,And I’m guessing    he eats more money than he makes.
218,Joey,"Look, I know she’s not a great agent, but    she did stick with me for ten years."
219,Joey,I’m gonna call her and hire her again.
220,Phoebe,"No, no, no!"
221,Phoebe,Don't call her!
222,Phoebe,You wait for her to call    you
223,Joey,Why?
224,Phoebe,Because patience is the road to understanding  which ...    is the key... to a happy heart.
225,Joey,You blow me away.
226,Phoebe,"All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her    to call you?"
227,Joey,I promise.
228,Joey,"And that means, never having to give a reason."
229,Chandler,And yet I never run into Beyonce!
230,Chandler,"Don't, don't!"
231,Monica,"No, actually, we're buying the house next door."
232,Chandler,Why!
233,Monica,I don't know    why.
234,Chandler,This can not be happening!
235,Monica,"Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer."
236,Monica,Maybe the Janice's won't get it!
237,Monica,Maybe the other couple will.
238,Chandler,"The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple    are the Hitlers."
239,Monica,"Okay, Okay,     All right."
240,Monica,What if we got both houses?
241,Monica,Huh?
242,Monica,We can turn this house    into a guest house.
243,Chandler,That is a great idea!
244,Chandler,"And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful,    but when did you start crapping money!"
245,Monica,"Okay, you come up with an idea."
246,Chandler,"Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on    our house."
247,Chandler,We can still get out.
248,Monica,But we love our house.
249,Chandler,Will we love it so much with her next door?
250,Chandler,And she's gonna be louder    out here too.
251,Chandler,"Just the crickets and  ""Oh My God""!"
252,Monica,"Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever    we go!"
253,Monica,"I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise."
254,Monica,"I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls    jump back up inside your body."
255,Chandler,"Well, we    have to do something."
256,Chandler,We can't have her living next door.
257,Chandler,"Oh, that does it too."
258,Ross,It's me.
259,Ross,Ron.
260,Ross,"Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might    be able to get her to come back."
261,Ross,Mr
262,Ross,Just hear me out.
263,Ross,How would you feel about offering her a raise?
264,Ross,Mr
265,Ross,Perhaps I can persuade you.
266,Ross,What if you can give your son this  genuine pterodactyl egg  replica.
267,Ross,Mr
268,Ross,Huh?
269,Ross,So?
270,Ross,We have a deal?
271,Ross,Mr
272,Ross,Yes!
273,Ross,yes!
274,Ross,Mr
275,Ross,"Oh,  Believe me, the ladies, they love it!"
276,Ross,Mr
277,Ross,"Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much."
278,Joey,Oh my God.
279,Joey,Hello?
280,Phoebe,"Joey,    it's Estelle."
281,Joey,Estelle?
282,Phoebe,"Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for    firing me."
283,Joey,Ok-ay.
284,Joey,"I just, I can't believe you're calling me?"
285,Phoebe,"Well, I didn't think I should just drop by..."
286,Joey,"No, no, no!"
287,Joey,"Don't drop by,    don't drop by!"
288,Phoebe,"Anyway, you did what you had to do."
289,Phoebe,I'm okay.
290,Joey,Can I ask you something?
291,Joey,"Uhm, what's it like there?"
292,Phoebe,It's alright.
293,Phoebe,"Look kiddo, I gotta go."
294,Phoebe,Good luck with    the career.
295,Phoebe,You're gonna be huge.
296,Joey,Thanks for everything Estelle.
297,Joey,Bye.
298,Joey,"""out of area""."
299,Joey,"Boy, I'll say."
300,Chandler,The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
301,Chandler,Wait!
302,Chandler,I just want you to know that...
303,Chandler,I'm so happy you're going to    be here.
304,Chandler,Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
305,Chandler,I never stopped loving you.
306,Chandler,"Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
307,Chandler,I want you...
308,Chandler,I need you...
309,Chandler,I must have you Janice    Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.
310,Chandler,"Now that you live next door, we can be together every day."
311,Chandler,Sid and    Monica never have to know a thing.
312,Chandler,Obviously.
313,Chandler,Don't say that.
314,Chandler,Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
315,Chandler,I understand.
316,Chandler,They're never coming down now.
317,Rachel,Hi!
318,Ross,Hey!
319,Rachel,You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
320,Ross,What?
321,Rachel,Ralph Lauren called again and they offered    me more money.
322,Ross,They did?
323,Rachel,Yeah.
324,Rachel,It was the weirdest thing.
325,Rachel,Zelner called me and he said we'll    do everything we can to get you back.
326,Rachel,And that I should thank some Ron...
327,Rachel,I    don't even know what department that guy's in.
328,Ross,"So, what are you gonna do?"
329,Rachel,"Well, I took it."
330,Ross,That's great!
331,Ross,So you're staying in New York!
332,Ross,"You're excited, right?"
333,Rachel,Ye-ah.
334,Rachel,Yeah!
335,Rachel,"You know, the money's great."
336,Rachel,It's certainly the easier choice...
337,Ross,Right!
338,Rachel,"Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to    Paris?"
339,Rachel,Sure.
340,Rachel,"You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital    of the world?"
341,Rachel,"Ooh, absolutely... Oh...!"
342,Rachel,"Yeah, but you know, this is... it's    fine."
343,Rachel,I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of    that I possibly can...
344,Ross,"Uhm, I hadn't no you..."
345,Ross,I had no idea you were so excited about Paris.
346,Ross,"Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared."
347,Rachel,"Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know?"
348,Rachel,Like when    I-moved-to-New-York scared.
349,Rachel,"Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared..."
350,Rachel,But this is... fine.
351,Rachel,This is gonna be good.
352,Ross,You should go.
353,Rachel,What?
354,Ross,It's what you want.
355,Ross,You should go.
356,Rachel,You really think so?
357,Ross,I really do.
358,Rachel,But I already told Zelner that I would come back...
359,Ross,I'm sure he'll    understand.
360,Rachel,All right.
361,Rachel,ALL RIGHT!
362,Rachel,I'm gonna do it.
363,Rachel,I'm gonna go to Paris.
364,Ross,Yeah...
365,Rachel,Yeah!
366,Rachel,I'm going to Paris.
367,Rachel,"Thank you, Ross!"
368,Ross,"Yeah, yeah, oh!"
369,Rachel,Oh!
370,Rachel,"Oh, I'm so happy."
371,Ross,Then I'm happy too.
372,Ross,COMMERCIAL BREAK
373,Joey,Thank you all for coming.
374,Joey,We're here today to pay respects    to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman...     ..inside.
375,Joey,As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words.
376,Joey,"Dude, where's    my speech?"
377,Joey,That is    entertaining.
378,Joey,Al Zebooker everybody.
379,Joey,THE END
