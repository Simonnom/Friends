5,Phoebe,Y'know?
6,Phoebe,A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.
7,Joey,Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him.
8,Phoebe,No!
9,Phoebe,No!
10,Phoebe,It's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
11,Chandler,I'll give up my ticket.
12,Joey,Me too.
13,Phoebe,Okay that's so generous!
14,Chandler,And I think Ross is generous too.
15,Phoebe,Great!
16,Phoebe,Okay then it's just us girls!
17,Phoebe,Monica and
18,Rachel,Great.
19,Phoebe,Yeah.
20,Rachel,So what-what is the exhibit.

23,Ross,Hey!
24,Rachel,Hi!
25,Chandler,Hey!
26,Joey,Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!

31,Monica,I mean think about all the money that you're gonna make!
32,Ross,Why?
33,Ross,What?
34,Monica,"Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?"
35,Ross,"No, no, that's funny."
36,Ross,"But maybe it's time to move on, let it go, y'know?"
37,Ross,Stop it!
38,Ross,"Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth's father, so ah, he's much older than she is."
39,Ross,"Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils, huh?"
40,Rachel,I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
41,Ross,"Okay, okay."
42,Ross,"Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings  in his ear."
43,Chandler,Ross.
44,Ross,"Oh, come on you guys; that's funny!"
45,Ross,Y'know?
46,Ross,"Because he's needhe's got like a hearing aide y'know, cause-cause y'know, cause he's all old, and"
47,Ross,Really?
48,Ross,"That okay, that's great."
49,Ross,"All right look, I-I realize it upsets you."
50,Ross,"But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don't think there's really anything you can do about it."
51,Ross,Ohh!
52,Ross,A man with a plan!
53,Ross,Opening Credits
54,Phoebe,"Oh, this is so exciting!"
55,Phoebe,You get your picture back up on the wall of fame!
56,Phoebe,Eek!
57,Joey,I know.
58,Joey,It was so cool when I was up there before.
59,Joey,Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin' up about something Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down.
60,Joey,Now he's just laughing at me.
61,Joey,"Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I'll"
62,Phoebe,"Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer."
63,Phoebe,"Look at him, smiling at me."

80,Monica,"Oh, I love museums!"
81,Rachel,Umm.
82,Monica,Soakin' up all the culture.
83,Rachel,Yeah.
84,Monica,Where do you want to start?
85,Rachel,"Ooh, the gift shop!"
86,Monica,Yeah!
87,Phoebe,"Hey, and then lunch."
88,Rachel,"Oh, wait yes, but I can't eat too much."
89,Rachel,"Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned."
90,Phoebe,Oh wow.
91,Phoebe,"What, do you think maybe he's gonna tell you that he's gay?"
92,Rachel,What?!
93,Rachel,No!
94,Rachel,Why?
95,Phoebe,No reason!
96,Phoebe,"That would just be a really big surprise, right?"
97,Phoebe,The Museum
98,Rachel,I didn't know you could get married here.
99,Monica,"This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there!"
100,Monica,I mean you'd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch.
101,Monica,The Museum
102,Rachel,Oh sorry didn't mean to interrupt.
103,Rachel,It's just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
104,Rachel,The Museum
105,Rachel,"Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list"
106,Monica,What?!
107,Monica,Are you crazy?!
108,Monica,I'm not getting married!
109,Monica,I'm not even engaged.
110,Phoebe,"Yeah, but there's a two-year wait."
111,Phoebe,And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place.
112,Phoebe,That's four years.
113,Phoebe,Chandler's not gonna wait that long.
114,Phoebe,"He's gonna find somebody else, y'know?"
115,Phoebe,"Someone, someone who did put their name on the list."
116,Rachel,"Yeah hon, it can't hurt to put your name down!"
117,Rachel,I mean in if two years if you're not engaged you just don't use it.
118,Monica,"Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down."
119,Rachel,I'm gonna do it too!
120,Phoebe,Me too!
121,Rachel,Really?
122,Rachel,"Who would, who would you marry?"
123,Phoebe,"I don't know, I don't have anyone right now."
124,Phoebe,Y'know?
125,Rachel,Oh Pheebs.
126,Phoebe,Don't feel too sorry for me.
127,Phoebe,At least my boyfriend isn't gay.
128,Monica,"Phoebe, that stuff is"
129,Phoebe,Don't even get me started on yours!

296,Rachel,Don't go in there!
297,Rachel,I need another soda!
298,Rachel,Oh my God Ross!
299,Rachel,What in heaven's name are you doing here?
300,Ross,And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
301,Ross,"Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain"
302,Ross,"All right, fine!"
303,Ross,Fine!
304,Ross,Have me fired!
305,Ross,"But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different."
306,Ross,"I mean, I too am a neat guy."
307,Ross,And I too am just a love machine.
308,Monica,I'm so sorry.
309,Monica,"Please, stop freaking out."
310,Chandler,I'm not freaking out.
311,Chandler,Why would I be freaking out?
312,Chandler,"A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday."
313,Monica,"Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun!"
314,Monica,"I mean, what's the harm in that?"
315,Chandler,Right here!
316,Monica,"Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you."
317,Monica,Phoebe and Rachel
318,Chandler,Phoebe and Rachel!
319,Chandler,"So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!"
320,Monica,It was a mistake.
321,Monica,"Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't."
322,Chandler,Okay.
323,Monica,Really?
324,Chandler,"Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready"
325,Monica,I know!
326,Monica,I know.
327,Chandler,Okay.
328,Monica,I'm gonna go tell Joey that  that you're back.
329,Monica,I was really worried about you.
330,Phoebe,"Hey, did she buy it?"
331,Chandler,Totally.
332,Phoebe,So did Heldi show you the place?
333,Chandler,"Yeah, it's beautiful."
334,Phoebe,I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you!
335,Chandler,I know.
336,Chandler,Ending Credits
