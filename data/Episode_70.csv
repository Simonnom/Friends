166,Rachel,"Monica, what is so amazing?"
167,Rachel,"I gave up, like, everything."
168,Rachel,And for what?
169,Phoebe,You are just like Jack.

171,Phoebe,"No, Jack and the Beanstalk."
172,Monica,"Ah, the other Jack."
173,Phoebe,"Yeah, right!"
174,Phoebe,"See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans."
175,Phoebe,"And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village.."
176,Rachel,"Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist."
177,Rachel,"Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-"

181,Rachel,"It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like..."
182,Phoebe,Floopy?
183,Rachel,Yeah.
184,Monica,"So what, you're not the only one."
185,Monica,"I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going."
186,Monica,"You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy."
187,Phoebe,"Oh, like that's a word."
188,Rachel,"Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?"
189,Monica,...Pheebs?
190,Phoebe,"Oh, well... 'cause.... you just..."
191,Phoebe,I don't like this question.

258,Chandler,"I mean, that guy with the toe thing?"
259,Chandler,Who's he sleeping with?
260,Chandler,"Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad..."
261,Chandler,"I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other."

282,Ross,"Look, it's just a little more complicated..."
283,Chandler,"Well, what?"
284,Chandler,What?
285,Chandler,What is it?
286,Chandler,That she left you?

330,Monica,"Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!"
331,Joey,Man.
332,Joey,Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
333,Chandler,I think it's great.
334,Chandler,"Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic..."
335,Joey,Really?
336,Chandler,"No, you kidding?"
