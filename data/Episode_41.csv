43,Rachel,"No, you're not!"
44,Rachel,Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!
45,Phoebe,"Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it!"
46,Phoebe,"See, there's something going on with them."
47,Phoebe,"Look, he's getting into the car with her!"
48,Rachel,"Oh, that doesn't mean anything."
49,Phoebe,Oh yeah?
50,Phoebe,"Well, let's see."
51,Phoebe,"Ok, duck down."
52,Chandler,Hello.

54,Phoebe,It's Phoebe.
55,Phoebe,Uhm...
56,Phoebe,I know that Monica is working today so...
57,Phoebe,...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.
58,Chandler,"Oh, uhm..."
59,Chandler,I have to work too.
60,Chandler,"Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day."
61,Phoebe,"Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either ""Liar, Liar"" or ""Betrayal"", or... ""An Affair To Remember""."
62,Chandler,Those are all really old!
63,Phoebe,"Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm..."
64,Rachel,"""Dude, Where's My Car?"""
65,Phoebe,What?
66,Rachel,They're in a caaar...

70,Phoebe,Ok. Quick.
71,Phoebe,We gotta find a cab and follow them.
72,Rachel,"Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun."
73,Phoebe,I got them!
74,Chandler,Hi!
75,Monica,Hey!
76,Monica,You smell like perfume and cigarettes.
77,Chandler,I was in the car with Nancy all day.
78,Monica,Nancy doesn’t smoke!
79,Chandler,"Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!"
80,Monica,So?
81,Monica,What do you think of the house?
82,Chandler,It’s perfect.
83,Chandler,It’s everything we’ve been looking for.
84,Monica,Isn’t it?
85,Monica,Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?
86,Chandler,And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps?
87,Chandler,What were the things you said?
88,Monica,Don’t you love the huge yard?
89,Chandler,And the fireplace in the bedroom.
90,Monica,"And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!"
91,Chandler,This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
92,Monica,So?
93,Monica,Do you think we should get it?
94,Chandler,I don’t know.
95,Chandler,What do you think?
96,Monica,I think we should.
97,Chandler,I do too.
98,Monica,This is huge!
99,Chandler,I know.
100,Monica,"How bad you wanna smoke, right now."
101,Chandler,"I don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette!"
102,Chandler,"Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy’s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day."
103,Monica,Gotcha.
104,Monica,When do we tell them about this?
105,Chandler,We don’t.
106,Chandler,Not until it's a hundred percent.
107,Chandler,"I mean, why upset everybody over nothing."
108,Monica,Okay.
109,Monica,Right.
110,Monica,Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.
111,Chandler,I know.
112,Chandler,Gooooood luck with it.
113,Ross,I just can’t see Chandler cheating!
114,Rachel,"I’m telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!"
115,Joey,Chandler?
116,Joey,Forty-five minutes?
117,Joey,"Well, something is not right."
118,Joey,I just can’t believe he would do this to Monica!
119,Ross,"I know, and with the baby coming?"
120,Phoebe,"So, should we tell her?"
121,Ross,I don’t know.
122,Ross,"Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?"
123,Phoebe,Why?
124,Phoebe,Who’d you seen him with?
125,Ross,"No one, I’m just saying if..."
126,Phoebe,TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!
127,Ross,I know nothing!
128,Ross,"Mike’s a great guy, it was hypothetical!"
129,Phoebe,All right.
130,Phoebe,He is a good guy.
131,Phoebe,"You’re right, he wouldn’t cheat."
132,Ross,"Believe me, if I did see with someone, there’s no way I...  Phoebe"
133,Rachel,"Oh, look at her, so happy!"
134,Monica,If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
135,Joey,"Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?"
136,Monica,"No, he’s picking up dinner, why, what’s up?"
137,Phoebe,"Well, look, whatever happens, we’re here for you and we love you."
138,Phoebe,Monica
139,Ross,We think Chandler might be having an affair.
140,Monica,What?
141,Rachel,Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.
142,Phoebe,They went in together.
143,Phoebe,So sorry.
144,Monica,Oh my God!
145,Monica,Oh my God that’s awful!
146,Monica,What did you think of the house?
147,Phoebe,What?
148,Joey,"Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?"
149,Monica,"Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously...  Did you think the neighborhood was homey?"
150,Chandler,Hey!
151,Joey,You son of a bitch!
152,Chandler,"Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?"
153,Monica,Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.
154,Rachel,Who's Nancy?
155,Ross,What's going on?
156,Monica,"Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big."
157,Chandler,Yeah  I'm not having an affair.
158,Chandler,Nancy is our realtor.
159,Joey,I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!
160,Phoebe,Why do you have a realtor?
161,Monica,"Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city."
162,Joey,What?
163,Rachel,Are you serious?
164,Monica,"When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city."
165,Phoebe,So you're gonna move?
166,Ross,Oh my God.
167,Joey,Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?
168,Rachel,What is wrong with raising a kid in the city?
169,Rachel,"I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!"
170,Monica,"And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset..."
171,Chandler,...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
172,Ross,So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?
173,Phoebe,Have you thought about what you would be giving up?
174,Phoebe,"You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am?"
175,Phoebe,Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?
176,Ross,"You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay."
177,Joey,"No, no, it's not, don't listen to him!"
178,Joey,I'm gonna thump you!
179,Ross,"It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be."
180,Chandler,"Actually, we already found a house we love."
181,Ross,What?
182,Monica,"And about an hour ago, we made an offer."
183,Chandler,"Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?"
184,Chandler,TIME LAPSE
185,Ross,You put an offer on a house?
186,Monica,It's so sweet.
187,Monica,It really is.
188,Monica,It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees...
189,Phoebe,Wha..?
190,Phoebe,"Again with the nature, what are you?"
191,Phoebe,Beavers?
192,Chandler,I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
193,Joey,Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food?
194,Joey,"Because I can stop doing that,  I really, really think I can!"
195,Chandler,You know that's not the reason Joe.
196,Monica,"We think if you saw it, you'd understand."
197,Monica,I mean you guys were there.
198,Monica,"It is beautiful, isn't it?"
199,Rachel,Yeah it is.
200,Joey,What the hell are you doin'?
201,Rachel,"Well, it is, all right?"
202,Rachel,"When we were out there today, all I kept thinking"
203,Phoebe,"Yeah, but so is this."
204,Ross,"Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here."
205,Ross,"I mean, how can you leave this place?"
206,Rachel,"C'mon Daddy, listen to me!"
207,Rachel,"All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe!"
208,Rachel,"You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'."
209,Rachel,"And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe?"
210,Rachel,"What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know?"
211,Rachel,Or a- or a hat!
212,Rachel,"No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!"
213,Ross,You can see where he'd have trouble.
214,Rachel,Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
215,Monica,"Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica..."
216,Ross,"That money is mine, Green!"
217,Rachel,"You're fly is open, Geller!"
218,Phoebe,"You guys, you know what I just realized?"
219,Phoebe,'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.'
220,Phoebe,Coincidence?
221,Chandler,"Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!"
222,Phoebe,"Eww, look."
223,Phoebe,Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
224,Rachel,"Ow, that had to hurt!"
225,Phoebe,"Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help."

238,Joey,It smells really bad in here.
239,Phoebe,"Well, of course it smells really bad."
240,Phoebe,You have your head inside a turkey's ass!
241,Monica,"Hey, did you get the turkey bast-Oh my God!"
242,Monica,Oh my God!
243,Monica,Who is that?
244,Joey,It's Joey.
245,Monica,I got it!
246,Monica,"How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?"
247,Rachel,Oooohh that’s interesting.
248,Chandler,"If you win, we give up the birds."
249,Joey,Dah!
250,Chandler,"But if we win, we get your apartment."

329,Monica,"Well, this is the last box of your clothes."
330,Monica,"I’m just gonna label it, ""What were you thinking?"""
331,Rachel,"Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler."
332,Phoebe,"Ok, you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore."
333,Phoebe,Monica and
334,Rachel,What?
335,Phoebe,You’re just so mean to each other!
336,Phoebe,And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel.

339,Monica,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her!"
340,Monica,"Y’know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate."
341,Monica,"She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like."
342,Phoebe,What else?
343,Monica,"When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror."
344,Rachel,"Yeah, I do."
345,Rachel,"I-I do, do that."
346,Phoebe,That’s nice.
347,Phoebe,I like having things to read in the bathroom.
348,Monica,"When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket."
349,Rachel,"Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold."
350,Monica,"And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive."
351,Monica,You were so great.

361,Monica,Can I ask you a question?
362,Chandler,Sure!
363,Monica,What the hell is that dog doing here?
364,Chandler,Little toast here.
365,Chandler,"I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting."
366,Chandler,"Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?"
367,Chandler,So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
368,Ross,"And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas."
369,Rachel,And a crappy New Year.
370,Chandler,"Here, here!"
371,Rachel,You can't move.
372,Rachel,You just... you just can't.
373,Joey,Rachel's right.
374,Joey,This is where you guys belong.
375,Phoebe,"Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester."
376,Phoebe,That's like the worst of the Chesters.
377,Ross,"You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better."
378,Ross,"And now when I look over, who am I gonna see?"
379,Ross,"The Gottliebs, the Yangs?"
380,Ross,They don't make me feel so good.
381,Rachel,Yeah.
382,Rachel,"So don't move, okay?"
383,Rachel,Just stay here and...  maybe close your blinds at night.
384,Chandler,Hello?
385,Chandler,"It's Nancy, they responded to our offer."
386,Monica,And?
387,Chandler,"Okay, thanks..."
388,Chandler,They passed.

390,Monica,We can't afford that.
391,Chandler,I know.
392,Monica,"Well, there you go."
393,Joey,I'm really sorry you guys.
394,Ross,Yeah.
395,Ross,I'm sorry too.
396,Ross,I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.
397,Rachel,"Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone."
398,Phoebe,You're gonna be okay?
399,Monica,"Yeah, we'll be okay."
400,Ross,Love you guys.
401,Joey,"You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before."
402,Chandler,"That's okay, we understand."
403,Joey,And about this Nancy thing...
404,Joey,"If you're not sleeping with her, should I?"
405,Monica,"I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so..."
406,Monica,I love that one so much.
407,Chandler,"Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then."
408,Monica,What?
409,Chandler,We got the house.
