7,Chandler,Yeah?
8,Chandler,Opening Credits
9,Ross,"Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand."
10,Chandler,"Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand."
11,Ross,Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
12,Chandler,I was shrieking... like a Marine.
13,Ross,All right here.
14,Ross,Watch me execute the three P's of championship play.
15,Ross,Power.
16,Ross,Precision.
17,Ross,and penache.

24,Ross,"Well, I'm gonna go see her."
25,Ross,"I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like?"
26,Monica,"Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk..."
27,Rachel,I'm gonna get back to retraining.
28,Ross,"All right, see you guys."
29,Chandler,"Look out kids, he's coming!"
30,Joey,And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
31,Phoebe,Have fun.
32,Phoebe,"Oh wait, no, don't!"
33,Phoebe,I forgot I am totally against that now.
34,Joey,What?
35,Joey,Me having a job?
36,Phoebe,"No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights."
37,Phoebe,"Hey, how do you sleep at night?"
38,Joey,"Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day."
39,Joey,"Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong."
40,Joey,"Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy."
41,Phoebe,Really?
42,Chandler,Yes.
43,Chandler,"Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York."
44,Rachel,"Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there."
45,Rachel,Huh.
46,Rachel,"Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs."
47,Rachel,"Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too."
48,Rachel,"Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to."
49,Rachel,"Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry."
50,Ross,"So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh?"
51,Ross,"I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore."
52,Ross,"Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?"
53,Ross,I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
54,Ross,Huh.
55,Ross,"Well, good luck to Dad."
56,Ross,"Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?"
57,Ross,Yeah.
58,Ross,"Four hundred, huh?"
59,Ross,"Well, that sounds do-able."
60,Ross,How much are the boxes?
61,Ross,And what is second prize?
62,Ross,"Well, that makes sense."
63,Ross,"Yeah, Sarah, anything."
64,Ross,"Hi, I'm selling Brown Bird cookies."
65,Ross,"No, hi, I'm, I'm an honorary Brown Bird"
66,Ross,"Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs."
67,Ross,"No, please, please, um, it's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world."
68,Ross,"Okay, okay!"
69,Ross,I'm going.
70,Ross,I'm going.
71,Ross,All right!
72,Phoebe,Hey.
73,Joey,Hey.
74,Joey,"What, what are you doing here?"
75,Phoebe,"Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental."
76,Phoebe,"Yeah,  oh, but oh..."
77,Joey,"Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas...."
78,Phoebe,Destiny.
79,Joey,Sure.
80,Phoebe,Yes.
81,Joey,All right.
82,Phoebe,Okay.
83,Phoebe,Yikes!
84,Phoebe,That one doesn't look very fulfilled.
85,Joey,"Oh, that's, that's ah, one of the old ones, he's just taking it to the back."
86,Phoebe,"You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist."
87,Joey,Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
88,Phoebe,"So, what happens to the old guys?"
89,Joey,"Well, they go into the chipper."
90,Phoebe,"Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds?"
91,Phoebe,No!
92,Phoebe,Nooooo!!
93,Joey,Hey!
94,Joey,Hey!
95,Ross,"...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus."
96,Joey,"All right, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's."
97,Ross,"Wait a minute, one box!"
98,Ross,"Come on, I'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes."
99,Ross,"Chandler, what about you?"
100,Chandler,"Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?"
101,Ross,"No, but ah, there's coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes."
102,Ross,"I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night."
103,Ross,Mon?
104,Monica,"All right, I'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it."
105,Monica,I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds.
106,Monica,"Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?"
107,Ross,"Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all."
108,Ross,"But ah, y'know I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time, why don't I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph's."
109,Monica,No.
110,Ross,"Oh, come on, now you know you want em."
111,Monica,"Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this."
112,Ross,"I'll tell you what Mon, I'll give you the first box for free."
113,Monica,Oh God!
114,Monica,I gotta go!
115,Ross,Come on!
116,Ross,All the cool kids are eating em!
117,Rachel,"I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks."
118,Joey,"Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing?"
119,Joey,I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
120,Rachel,"Well, yeah!"
121,Rachel,I'm still pursuing that.
122,Chandler,How... exactly are you pursuing that?
123,Chandler,"Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?"
124,Rachel,"Well, I'm also sending out.... good thoughts."
125,Joey,"If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one."
126,Joey,You need the fear.
127,Rachel,The fear?
128,Chandler,"He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want."
129,Rachel,"Well then how come you're still at a job that you hate, I mean why don't you quit and get the fear'?"
130,Chandler,"Because, I'm too afraid."
131,Rachel,"I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here."
132,Chandler,"Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here."
133,Rachel,Yeah.
134,Rachel,Can't I just look at the handles on them?
135,Rachel,"Okay, fine."
136,Rachel,"Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress?"
137,Rachel,"Because, I don't care."
138,Rachel,I don't care.
139,Rachel,"I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do."
140,Rachel,So I don't think I should do it anymore.
141,Rachel,I'm gonna give you my weeks notice.
142,Rachel,"Gunther, I quit."
143,Chandler,Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee?
144,Chandler,Commercial Break
145,Ross,"....and 12, 22, 18, four...  What?"
146,Chandler,I spelled out boobies.

148,Monica,"Where, where are the mint treasures?"
149,Ross,"Ah, we're out."
150,Ross,I sold them all.
151,Monica,What?
152,Ross,"Monica, I'm cutting you off."
153,Monica,No.
154,Monica,"No, just, just, just a couple more boxes."
155,Monica,"It-it-it's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool."
156,Monica,You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
157,Ross,"Mon, look at yourself."
158,Ross,You have cookie on your neck.
159,Monica,Oh God!
160,Chandler,"So, how many have you sold so far?"
161,Ross,Check this out.
162,Ross,Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
163,Chandler,"Oh my God, how did you do that?"
164,Ross,"Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes!"
165,Ross,"That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, the munchies.'"
166,Ross,"So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight."
167,Ross,I am selling cookies by the case.
168,Ross,They call

178,Rachel,You wanna know what else is really funny?
179,Chandler,Something else I might have said?
180,Rachel,"I don't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do."
181,Rachel,Ha!
182,Rachel,Ha!
183,Rachel,Ha!

185,Rachel,Ha!
186,Ross,"Sweetie, calm down, it's gonna be okay."
187,Rachel,"No, it's not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead."
188,Rachel,"Okay, y'know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna call Gunther and I'm gonna tell him, I'm not quitting."
189,Chandler,You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
190,Rachel,You and your stupid fear.
