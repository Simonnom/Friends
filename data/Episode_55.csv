10,Monica,"Oh yeah, I remember mine!"
11,Monica,"Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, andit bent."
12,Ross,Yeah.
13,Phoebe,I never had a bike of my own.
14,Ross,What?
15,Phoebe,"Well, we didn't have a lot of money."
16,Phoebe,But the girl across the street had the best bike!
17,Phoebe,"It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on."
18,Chandler,That sounds like my first bike.
19,Chandler,My dad gave me his old one.
20,Ross,Ohh.
21,Monica,Did the girl ever let you ride it?
22,Phoebe,No!
23,Phoebe,But she gave me the box that it came in.
24,Phoebe,It had a picture of the bike on the front.
25,Phoebe,So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.
26,Ross,That is so unfair!
27,Phoebe,"Not really, I got to drag him around too!"

42,Rachel,Gooood morning!
43,Chandler,"Eh, somebody's in a good mood!"
44,Rachel,"Well, why shouldn't I be?"

47,Monica,Where you can make out with your assistant.
48,Rachel,"Come on, it's not a big deal!"
49,Rachel,We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
50,Monica,"Oh yeah, what's the plan?"
51,Rachel,We We are not going to let it be a problem.
52,Monica,Wow!

67,Rachel,That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us.
68,Rachel,"Okay, you hard worker!"
69,Rachel,I'll remember to put that in your evaluation.
70,Rachel,"Well, you've been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation."
71,Rachel,"But y'know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate."
72,Rachel,"No, I've just always wanted to do that."
73,Rachel,Can you help me clean this up?
74,Monica,The basket is totally empty!
75,Monica,"My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!"
76,Chandler,"Well, either that or uh"
77,Monica,Joey!
78,Joey,Yeah?

82,Phoebe,They love it!
83,Monica,They love my candy?
84,Monica,Oh man!!!

135,Rachel,I'm thinkin' no.
136,Rachel,"Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie."
137,Rachel,"Well, it gets worse."
138,Rachel,"When asked if you take initiative I wrote, ""Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision,"" and under Problems with Performance I wrote, ""Dear God, I hope not,"" and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch."
139,Monica,Ross!

167,Monica,And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs.
168,Monica,Did you hear that Chandler?
169,Monica,No such thing!
170,Chandler,What happened?
171,Chandler,I'm just eating candy.
172,Rachel,Maybe it's not as bad as I think.
173,Rachel,"Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it."
174,Chandler,Absolutely!
175,Chandler,"Y'know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker."
176,Rachel,"Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!"

195,Monica,The
196,Joey,"Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?"
197,Chandler,"Maybe, isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?"
198,Monica,"All right, I'll do it just this once!"

221,Phoebe,"Perhaps, like an airplane seator a beanbag chair!"
222,Ross,"Phoebe, you can't get out of this!"
223,Ross,Okay?
224,Ross,You have to learn how to ride a bike!
225,Phoebe,Why?
226,Phoebe,Why do I have to learn?
227,Ross,WellIn-in case of emergency.
228,Phoebe,What kind of an emergency?
229,Ross,"Well let therewhat if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, ""You ride this bike or I'll shI'll shoot you."""
230,Phoebe,"Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star."
231,Ross,"Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike andHey!"
232,Ross,I'll hold you up and-and push you.
233,Ross,Okay?

258,Phoebe,Oh!
259,Phoebe,Oh no!!
260,Phoebe,You swore!
261,Ross,I-I just thought you were doing so well.
262,Phoebe,I am shocked!
263,Phoebe,Shocked!
264,Ross,It's a legitimate learning technique.
265,Ross,Wow!
266,Ross,"Hey, there's uh, some people outside, askin' about candy."
267,Monica,"Well, they're just gonna have to wait aren't they?"
268,Monica,I've only got two hands!
269,Ross,Need some help?
270,Monica,No!
271,Monica,You don't know the system!
272,Monica,There'll be nobody messing with the system!
273,Ross,"By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me."
274,Phoebe,"Oh, hello liar."
275,Ross,"Look, I-I'm really sorry I let go of the bike."
276,Phoebe,I could've been killed I hope you know!
277,Ross,I know.
278,Ross,I know.
279,Ross,"But, can we please try it again?"
280,Ross,Huh?
281,Ross,"I mean, you were so close Phoebe!"
282,Phoebe,"Well, I would love to butthe bike got stolen and the police have no suspects."
283,Ross,Phoebe.
284,Phoebe,What?!
285,Phoebe,What the hell?
286,Ross,"All right, y'know what?"
287,Ross,"If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I'm sorry, I'm just gonna have to take it back."
288,Phoebe,What?!
289,Phoebe,Why?
290,Ross,Because!
291,Ross,"Because, it-it-it's It'd be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it."
292,Ross,"Okay, this guitar wants to be played!"
293,Ross,And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don't ride it you-you're-you're killing its spirit!
294,Ross,The bike is dying.
295,Phoebe,All right.
296,Phoebe,"If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay."
297,Ross,Great!
298,Ross,Great!
299,Ross,You're making the bike very happy.
300,Phoebe,Okay Ross!
301,Phoebe,Please don't die!
302,Rachel,"Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we're gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner's office."
303,Rachel,"Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk."
304,Rachel,"Yeah, well Betty's kinda sad."
305,Rachel,Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.
306,Rachel,"Now, while I distract her, you get in the office."
307,Rachel,Let's roll!
308,Rachel,Mr.
309,Rachel,"Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anythingminute."
310,Rachel,Okay.
311,Rachel,Fine.
312,Rachel,"Abort the plan, abort the plan."
313,Rachel,Mr.
314,Rachel,Okay.
315,Rachel,"Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner?"
316,Rachel,Maybe some chocolates?
317,Rachel,Mr.
318,Rachel,Oh my God.
319,Rachel,Can you imagine if there was?!
320,Rachel,"I mean,  what would happen exactly."
321,Rachel,Mr.
322,Rachel,Well
323,Rachel,Oh no-no-no
324,Rachel,You're lookin' at it upside downy'know what?
325,Rachel,It doesn't matter.
326,Rachel,Mr.
327,Rachel,Whoa!
328,Rachel,I can't believe you did that.
329,Rachel,That was really sweet.
330,Rachel,"No, you could've lost your job."
331,Rachel,Thank you!
332,Rachel,You're great!
333,Rachel,What?
334,Rachel,I It justit took me so long to get that desk organized.

348,Monica,The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
349,Chandler,All right everybody!
350,Chandler,Just be quiet!
351,Chandler,Be quiet!
352,Chandler,Be quiet!!
353,Chandler,Pipe-pipe-pipe down!
354,Chandler,What is the matter with you people?!
355,Chandler,This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you.
356,Chandler,"She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name!"
357,Chandler,Am I right?
358,Chandler,The
359,Chandler,No not  Candy Lady.
360,Joey,"Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!"
361,Chandler,"All right, y'know what?"
362,Chandler,"Forget it, all of you forget it!"
363,Chandler,You've ruined it!
364,Chandler,Go home!
365,Chandler,You've ruined it!
366,Chandler,You've ruined it!
367,Joey,"That's right, it's all ruined!"
368,Joey,You guys ruined everything!
369,Joey,You ruined it!
370,Monica,Thank you.
371,Chandler,You're welcome.
372,Monica,Did you smoke?
373,Chandler,No!
374,Chandler,Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth.
375,Chandler,Eh-uhare you okay?
376,Monica,"I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while."
377,Monica,"I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door."
378,Joey,"Oh yeah, sorry about that."
379,Joey,"Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know  Ending Credits"
380,Phoebe,I can't believe it!
381,Phoebe,I did it!
382,Phoebe,I rode a bike!
383,Phoebe,I never thought I'd be able to do that!
384,Phoebe,Thank you Ross.
385,Ross,"Oh hey, don't thank me, thank yourself."
386,Ross,You're the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
387,Phoebe,"Don't be so corny Ross, it's not an after-school special."
388,Phoebe,End
