141,Monica,It could be Amanda!
142,Phoebe,"Oh, you’re right!"
143,Phoebe,I was just kidding about   Rachel.
144,Phoebe,Babysitting is a gas!

186,Joey,I'm an expert at taking off bras!
187,Joey,I can do it with one hand!
188,Joey,I can   do it with my eyes closed!
189,Joey,"One time I just looked at one, and it popped open!"
190,Joey,I blame your bra!
191,Rachel,It’s a standard issue bra clasp!
192,Joey,Then I blame you!
193,Joey,Yeah!
194,Joey,That's right!
195,Joey,You threw me   off with all your slapping!
196,Rachel,"Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey,   but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take   off my bra?"
197,Joey,NAH!
198,Joey,I don't have another level!
199,Chandler,Hold on!
200,Chandler,There is something different.
201,Ross,I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
202,Chandler,Was that place...
203,Chandler,The Sun?
204,Ross,Oh!
205,Ross,And it gets worse!
206,Chandler,Oh My God!
207,Chandler,You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory   all by yourself!
208,Monica,How could you mess this up?
209,Monica,It's   so easy?
210,Monica,"You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!"
211,Ross,How do you count to five?

218,Rachel,What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
219,Chandler,How was your date with Joey?
220,Rachel,"Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment,   and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and   I kept slapping it away!"
221,Chandler,You didn't like that?
222,Rachel,"Well, it wasn't just me, alright?"
223,Rachel,He freaked out   too!
224,Rachel,He couldn't even undo my bra!
225,Monica,"Wow, really?"
226,Monica,One time he just looked   at my bra and it popped open.
227,Rachel,"I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have   kissed before and that's been great!"
228,Rachel,But this time it was leading somewhere   and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
229,Monica,"Well, you guys have been friends   forever."
230,Monica,Remember the first time that you kissed Ross?
231,Monica,How weird that was?
232,Monica,You couldn't stop laughing?
233,Monica,You got through that.
234,Rachel,"Ok, that's true."
235,Rachel,"That's true,   we can do this."
236,Rachel,"You're right, you're right, we can do this."
237,Rachel,We're just gonna   power through!
238,Joey,Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second .
239,Rachel,No need!!
240,Rachel,"Problem solved, we are powering through   ."

246,Monica,Is Amanda here yet?
247,Phoebe,No.
248,Monica,Oh good.
249,Monica,"Good, look   I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan."
250,Monica,But I have a new plan.
251,Monica,Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.
252,Phoebe,Oh!
253,Phoebe,"Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both   out of here?"
254,Monica,"Well, what do you think of Mike   and Chandler being in a car accident?"
255,Phoebe,"Are you kidding, I love it!"
256,Phoebe,Hi!
257,Monica,Hi!

264,Monica,You were going to cut   me out?
265,Phoebe,Well...kinda.
266,Monica,Oh My God!
267,Phoebe,"Yeah well, in America you're just an ""ass""."
268,Monica,Hello?
269,Monica,"Chandler,   what's wrong?"
270,Monica,"Oh my God, are you alright?"
271,Monica,"Yeah, I'll be right there."
272,Monica,"I'm so sorry,   but Chandler was in a car accident."
273,Phoebe,Oh my   God.

284,Rachel,Alright!
285,Rachel,Lets do it!
286,Joey,"Ok, you're scaring me a little bit."
287,Rachel,Oh!
288,Rachel,"Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this!"
289,Rachel,Ok. Aha!
290,Rachel,You like   that huh?
291,Joey,Oh!

295,Joey,uh uh!
296,Rachel,"Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!"
297,Joey,"No, no, no!"
298,Joey,You kneed me in my misters!
299,Rachel,What?
300,Rachel,Oh my God!
301,Rachel,I'm so sorry.
302,Rachel,Joey?
303,Rachel,Are you ok?
304,Joey,Soldier down!
305,Monica,We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.
306,Chandler,"If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!"
307,Phoebe,Oh Chandler!
308,Phoebe,Thank God you're alive.
309,Phoebe,"Monica, can   I talk to you outside for a minute?"
310,Monica,I have nothing to say to   you.
311,Phoebe,"Please, Monica?"
312,Phoebe,In the hall?
313,Chandler,"Well, aren't you a treat."
314,Monica,I can't believe you tried to cut   me out.
315,Monica,"Why Phoebe, why?"
316,Phoebe,"It was right after we were living together and you   were driving me crazy, okay?"
317,Phoebe,You were really controlling and compulsive and   shrill.
318,Monica,I'm still all those things!
319,Phoebe,You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!
320,Monica,I am scrappy.
321,Phoebe,Exactly!
322,Phoebe,"Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't   keep you out of my life."
323,Phoebe,"Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only   one who ever clawed her way back in."
324,Monica,It's because I'm scrappy.
325,Phoebe,"Yeah, you are."
326,Phoebe,"And I'm so glad that you fought your   way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you."
327,Monica,I won't know what I would do without   you.
328,Monica,"Well, I guess we should go back   in."
329,Monica,"When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda."
330,Phoebe,"Yeah, I guess you're right."
331,Ross,"I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda."
332,Ross,Okay?
333,Ross,"Does   it look like this is my first time, huh?"
334,Ross,Now I want 4 two's... and I want them   all on my back.
335,Ross,"Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one   is it?"
336,Ross,Which... which... which...
337,Ross,Which one is it?
338,Ross,OH!
339,Ross,SON OF A BITCH!
340,Rachel,What is the matter with us?
341,Joey,"Well, I know what's the matter with me."
342,Rachel,"No, I mean with us, you know."
343,Rachel,"I mean, is it supposed   to be this... difficult?"
344,Joey,I don't know.
345,Chandler,"That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she   sure can dance... Hey!"
346,Rachel,Hi!
347,Rachel,"Hey, listen, can we ask you a question?"
348,Rachel,"When   you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more   than that?"
349,Chandler,"Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide   from you guys..."
350,Rachel,"No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally..."
351,Joey,"Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it   was... really wrong?"
352,Chandler,"Actually, no."
353,Chandler,"No, it felt right."
354,Chandler,"You know, it felt   like uhm..."
355,Chandler,I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.
356,Chandler,"I can tell from your expressions that that's the   good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the   joy."
357,Rachel,"Well, just because it happened that way for them   doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us."
358,Joey,"Yeah, yeah..."
359,Joey,Absolutely.
360,Joey,"I mean, just because something's   difficult doesn't mean that you quit."
361,Rachel,"Right, totally."
362,Joey,"Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we...   do it."
363,Rachel,"Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one   of those couples that never have sex."
364,Joey,That's a... pla-an.
365,Joey,Wow...
366,Joey,I did not see this coming.
367,Rachel,I know.
368,Joey,I don't get it.
369,Joey,"I mean, I was so sure this was what   I wanted."
370,Rachel,Hmmm... Me too...
371,Rachel,I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
372,Joey,I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
373,Rachel,Aah...
374,Rachel,I bet you're right.
375,Joey,So...
376,Rachel,Yeah.
377,Joey,I love ya.
