0,Ross,Hey!
1,Ross,"I just got uh, my teacher evaluations!"
2,Ross,"Check out what this one student wrote, ""I loved Dr. Geller's class."
3,Ross,Mind blowing lectures!
4,Ross,"Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"""
5,Chandler,"Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there's a big selling calendar, eh?"
6,Rachel,Who wrote it?
7,Ross,"Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous."
8,Joey,"Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?"
9,Ross,Yeah.
10,Joey,"Oh, cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer."
11,Chandler,A hot girl's at stake and all of the sudden he's Rain Man.
12,Rachel,"Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?"
13,Ross,It's a girl!
14,Ross,"Anyway, it wouit wouldn't matter."
15,Ross,Okay?
16,Ross,Because I'm a teacher and she's a student.
17,Chandler,"Oh, is that against the rules?"
18,Ross,"No, but it is frowned upon."
19,Chandler,I see.
20,Ross,"Besides, there's a big age difference."
21,Joey,"Oh, well think of it like this, when you're 90"
22,Ross,I know when I'm 90 she'll be like 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.
23,Joey,No that's not what I was going to say at all.
24,Joey,"No, what I was going to say is when you're 90 you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old."
25,Joey,Opening Credits

177,Monica,"So, now you're going on a date with this girl?"
178,Chandler,"Honey, it is not a date!"
179,Chandler,I haven't talked to her in ten years!
180,Chandler,You can't just call up somebody you haven't talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor.
181,Chandler,"There are rules, y'know?"
182,Chandler,"You gotta, you got to put in some time."
183,Monica,"You're right, I'm sorry."
184,Monica,"It's not like you're y'know, going out with an ex-girlfriend."
185,Chandler,"No, we only went out once."
186,Monica,You dated her!
187,Chandler,Not once!
188,Monica,"All right, well why don't I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?"
189,Joey,"Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey."
190,Chandler,"Oh that's great, my friend Joey's in the movie business."

197,Rachel,Oh my God!
198,Rachel,It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
199,Monica,I know!
200,Monica,"Now look, there's only one problem though."
201,Monica,"There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's."
202,Phoebe,"Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess  you should get to stay here."
203,Rachel,Hey!
204,Rachel,"Hey-hey, now this was no one's fault Pheebs."
205,Rachel,Okay?
206,Rachel,It was an accident.
207,Phoebe,"Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room."
208,Rachel,Okay!
209,Monica,So Rach!
210,Monica,You're the first guest at Hotel Monica!
211,Monica,"Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning."

213,Monica,"Oh, you have been through so much."
214,Rachel,I have.
215,Joey,This right here is where I keep the pizza.

218,Joey,I know!
219,Ross,What?
220,Ross,Of course I did!
221,Ross,"You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson."
222,Ross,"Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone's name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames."
223,Ross,Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
224,Ross,"Umm, no."
225,Ross,No.
226,Ross,"Umm, it's Cutie McPretty."
227,Ross,"Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I'm having a great time!"
228,Ross,"Y'know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it's not."
229,Ross,I mean it's not at all.
230,Ross,Burt!
231,Phoebe,So did you sleep well last night?
232,Rachel,I did.
233,Phoebe,Yeah?
234,Rachel,"I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow."

254,Joey,Commercial Break
255,Monica,Now there you go!
256,Monica,I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes!
257,Phoebe,Thanks Monica!
258,Monica,Does that smell bother you?
259,Phoebe,What the smell from Joey's?
260,Phoebe,"No, I can hardly smell it over here."
261,Monica,"Well you let me know if you can, because y'know I can bake a pie to cover it."
262,Phoebe,"I can smell it a little, bake the pie."
263,Monica,Okay!
264,Phoebe,Okay.
265,Monica,Hello?
266,Monica,"Oh yes, one minute please."
267,Monica,It's for you.
268,Monica,It's the fire inspector.
269,Phoebe,Oh!
270,Phoebe,Hello?
271,Phoebe,Yeah this is Phoebe.
272,Phoebe,Really?
273,Joey,"Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair straightener that started the fire."
274,Joey,"No-no, it was the candles."
275,Joey,It's very not good leaving candles unattended.
276,Joey,"In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is  Uhh Uhh Okay."
277,Joey,"Well, I have to go now."
278,Ross,We had such a great time!
279,Ross,She's-she's incredible!
280,Ross,"I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't."
281,Ross,It wasn't at all.
282,Ross,Elizabeth is very mature for her age.
283,Ross,A concept lost on some people!
284,Monica,So it's okay to date a student.
285,Ross,"Well, not really."
286,Ross,"I mean technically it's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon."
287,Ross,"Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou."
288,Monica,"Well Ross, you be careful now."
289,Monica,You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents.
290,Ross,Yeah.
291,Ross,What-what should I do?
292,Joey,"Well Ross, it seems pretty clear."
293,Joey,I mean what's more important?
294,Joey,"What people think or how you feel, huh?"
295,Joey,"Ross, you gotta follow your heart."
296,Monica,Joey that is so sweet.
297,Chandler,Hey.
298,Joey,Hey-hey-hey!
299,Joey,"So, how did it go with Dana?"
300,Joey,Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
301,Chandler,I couldn't do it.
302,Joey,You couldn't do it?
303,Chandler,"Hey, relax I just need more time."
304,Chandler,We're going to dinner tonight.
305,Monica,What?!
306,Monica,You're going out with her again!

328,Chandler,"Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend."
329,Chandler,"This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?"
330,Chandler,"Well, the heart wants what it wants."
331,Chandler,I'll see you later.
332,Monica,Hey!
333,Monica,How's it goin'?
334,Phoebe,"Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes."
335,Monica,Yes it has!
336,Monica,I made cookies!
337,Phoebe,Oh that's all right.
338,Phoebe,I'm still full from your homemade potato chips.
339,Monica,But you should eat them now because they're hot from the oven.
340,Phoebe,Okay.
341,Monica,Oh-ho!

366,Ross,Huh?
367,Ross,You wanna go get a drink?
368,Ross,"Oh, you have some studying to do?"
369,Ross,"Y'know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to"
370,Ross,"Nothing, I'm-I'm just, I'm so comfortable with you!"
371,Ross,What?
372,Ross,No!
373,Ross,"Of course, of course I do!"

375,Ross,What?!
376,Ross,No!
377,Ross,No!

407,Rachel,Hi!
408,Phoebe,"Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!"
409,Rachel,Uh-huh.
410,Phoebe,"Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I'm partly at fault."
411,Phoebe,"You see, I didn't, I didn't tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y'know let's just face it, that's just kindling!"
412,Phoebe,So I think it's better that I stay at Joey's.
413,Rachel,"No, no-no-no."
414,Rachel,"Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y'know what?"
415,Rachel,I'm fine here.
416,Phoebe,Okay.

440,Ross,Wow!
441,Ross,It actually is in the handbook.
442,Ross,I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office.
443,Ross,I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
444,Ross,"I know, I know I really like you too."
445,Ross,But we-we can't date.
446,Ross,It's against the rules.
447,Ross,It's forbidden.
