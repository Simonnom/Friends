4,Monica,Like if the Queen of England comes over.
5,Chandler,"Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint."
6,Monica,"What if something gets broken, they're so expensive."

88,Joey,"Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a   raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said ""Hey   don't eat that-that's Phoebe's"" and he said.. <pause> He said.. ""Joey   you stink at lying."""

104,Ross,"Sure, we don't live there but..."
105,Rachel,"Yeah, no."
106,Rachel,Ross has a PhD.
107,Rachel,God she is unbelievable.
108,Ross,"I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD."
109,Rachel,"Oh sure Ross, yeah."
110,Rachel,"If I have a heart attack in a   restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush."
111,Rachel,Amy storms
112,Rachel,What?

114,Ross,Don't say that.
115,Rachel,"Oh Amy, don't cry Amy."
116,Rachel,"Um.. Ross, could I talk   to you in private?"
117,Ross,"Sure, you want to go upstairs?"
118,Ross,<Ross and Rachel go in the kitchen>
119,Rachel,Um look I was thinking..
120,Rachel,If its ok with Monica I   would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.
121,Ross,"You know, I think thats a great idea."
122,Ross,It'll be like   the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.
123,Rachel,Look I know she's a little tough to take.
124,Rachel,"She has   no where else to go, and she's my sister."
125,Rachel,"Alright, she's Emma's aunt."
126,Rachel,And I   would like them to bond.
127,Ross,"Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much."
128,Ross,I   don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.
129,Rachel,"Ross, you know what?"
130,Rachel,She may need one..We're just   going to have to make our peace with that!
131,Rachel,<Rachel grabs Ross' hand for support and starts to cry a little> Monica and Chandler's apartment Rachel opens their

138,Joey,"Pheebs, I still need some help here"
139,Phoebe,"Oh right, ok um."
140,Phoebe,Ok so its not just the lie you tell.
141,Phoebe,but its the way you tell it.
142,Phoebe,"For example if you look down at the ground when   you're talking, people know you're lying."
143,Joey,Oh..
144,Joey,I don't know why this is so hard for me.
145,Joey,you know..
146,Joey,I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor.
147,Joey,Phoebe looks
148,Rachel,Oh we just put her down for a nap.
149,Phoebe,Thats a great movie.
150,Phoebe,<she claps> <Joey nods in agreement>

152,Ross,Amy turns around to
153,Phoebe,"Emma, Ross wants you."
154,Phoebe,PHOE-BE.
155,Phoebe,Amy turns to Ross and
156,Rachel,Why does she keep making that   noise?
157,Rachel,"Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um,   if something were to happen to Ross or to myself <Ross and Rachel knock   on wood> um you wouldn't get the baby."
158,Ross,"Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would   want Monica and Chandler."
159,Chandler,I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
160,Monica,"yeah oh my god, I'm so moved."
161,Rachel,"See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler."
162,Rachel,We see them every day.
163,Rachel,"And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected   to the baby."
164,Chandler,"You know, guys I got to say."
165,Chandler,This means so much   to me.
166,Chandler,That you would trust me with your child.
167,Chandler,"I mean, we all know that Monica   and I have been trying to have a baby of our own."
168,Chandler,"You know I've had my doubts   about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts   to cry>"
169,Monica,Okay!
170,Monica,It's time for dinner.
171,Monica,Everyone we're using   our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.
172,Monica,Ross starts playing with a
173,Monica,"Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will   not be well recieved."
174,Monica,<pinches Ross' arm> Ross makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt.
175,Joey,Hey!
176,Joey,How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's?
177,Joey,Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?
178,Monica,"No, honey, its."
179,Monica,thats a special plate.
180,Monica,"See   its a game, whoever gets that plate wins."
181,Joey,I can't believe I won.
182,Rachel,Monica is Ross' sister.
183,Monica,That was me.
184,Rachel,Hey.
185,Rachel,Amy.
186,Rachel,You've got to stop doing that.
187,Rachel,"<Amy gets pissed and starts cutting food on the fancy plate very harshly,   you can hear the silveware scraping the fancy plate>  Monica about to have a heart"
188,Monica,"Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets   face it you have fun."
189,Chandler,"No, if crazy plate lad.. <sees Monica frustrated   at this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?"
190,Chandler,<Ross and Rachel pause and ponder this>
191,Rachel,Well actually...
192,Chandler,Actually what?
193,Ross,well.. its just.
194,Ross,"its just in that case, then um."
195,Ross,Emma   would go to my parents.
196,Chandler,What?
197,Chandler,"So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough   to raise Emma?"
198,Chandler,Ross looks
199,Joey,Yeah he's lying.
200,Joey,He looked down.
201,Joey,<Joey looks to Phoebe and she nods in agreement>
202,Chandler,Well what is wrong with me?
203,Chandler,Am I .. am I incomptent?
204,Chandler,Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!
205,Rachel,"Honey, you're taking this the wrong way."
206,Rachel,We think   you're going to be a wonderful parent.
207,Rachel,It's just.. you're more the fun parent.
208,Ross,Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like   Monica who is more uh.
209,Ross,uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.
210,Monica,"Thats not how you see me, is it?"
211,Monica,Phoebe while cutting a sweet potatoe in the
212,Chandler,"Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do   you really think I'm not capable?"
213,Ross,"No, you both are equally capable."
214,Ross,Its just.. you're   strongest when.. when you're together.
215,Chandler,Ok.
216,Chandler,So if we both had Emma and I die <knocks   on table> she'd have to give her up.
217,Ross,"Sure, Monica would have to give her up."
218,Joey,"I lie better then that, right?"
219,Chandler,So.. let me get this straight.
220,Chandler,"So my two friends   die, I get Emma."
221,Chandler,"Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left   in my life gets taken away from me?"
222,Phoebe,There's your movie!
223,Phoebe,<claps>  Later on.
224,Phoebe,Monica opens her front door.
225,Phoebe,Chandler is sitting in the hallway.
226,Monica,Hey.
227,Monica,There you are.
228,Monica,You disappeared after dinner.
229,Chandler,Oh?
230,Chandler,Did somebody miss me?
231,Chandler,Is there a child to raise   poorly?
232,Monica,Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about.
233,Monica,I mean its not like their so responsible.
234,Monica,Emma is a product of a bottle of   Merlot and a five year old condom.
235,Chandler,Yeah but they're right.
236,Chandler,"I mean, I'm not a strong   father figure and I never will be."
237,Monica,No you learn these things.
238,Monica,You grow into it.
239,Chandler,"Yeah, but its not who I am."
240,Chandler,Everything they said   was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid.
241,Chandler,And its true.
242,Chandler,And look everybody   knows it.
243,Monica,I don't know it!
244,Monica,I want to have a kid with you because   I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard   parts.
245,Chandler,"Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying ""Go   to your room!"
246,Chandler,"You're grounded""?"
247,Monica,"Can you hear me say ""You're grounded""?"
248,Chandler,You said that to me last week.
249,Monica,How hard is it?
250,Monica,No shoes on the furniture.
251,Monica,Back to Monica and Chandler's apartment.
252,Monica,Amy is sitting on a chair by the bay window looking mad.
253,Monica,Joey groans and gets off the
254,Phoebe,It's ok.
255,Phoebe,I thought of the perfect lie for you.
256,Phoebe,It's   easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions.
257,Phoebe,You weren't at the   parade because you had a family emergency.
258,Joey,"Oh, I like that, yeah."
259,Joey,Wasn't at the parade because   I had a family emergency.
260,Phoebe,"Ooh, what happened?"

266,Monica,Oh wait.. What are you doing?
267,Joey,Setting the table.
268,Phoebe,Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy   china for dessert too.
269,Monica,Oh how nice.
270,Monica,Maybe later we can all go blow our noses   on my wedding dress.
271,Monica,Ross comes out of the guest bedroom with the diaper bag and the car seat carrying   thingy.. yeah.. thats the techinal term..
272,Monica,He goes to Chandler.
273,Ross,"Hey dude, you okay?"
274,Ross,Sorry about before.
275,Chandler,"Oh no thats okay, you're totally right."
276,Chandler,I don't   know anything about disciplining a child.
277,Chandler,"But it did hurt my feelings and I   want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey."
278,Chandler,Ross walks away with a face of yeah ok. Amy walks over to the couch and sits down next to

295,Rachel,You want to know why I'm not giving   Emily to you.
296,Ross,Emma.
297,Ross,Rachel turns to
298,Ross,Oh whose side are you on?
299,Ross,<back   to Amy> I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle   the responibility of a child.
300,Joey,ooh oooh..
301,Rachel,uh huh.
302,Rachel,Jealous of what?
303,Rachel,Of your lack of responsiblity?
304,Rachel,"You,   your immaturity?"

337,Chandler,Alright!
338,Chandler,That is it.
339,Chandler,This is our apartment and   you can not behave this way.
340,Chandler,Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't   be here at all.
341,Chandler,"Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones   I picked out, but they're very important to Monica."
342,Chandler,I want you to apologize   to her right now.
343,Rachel,"Mon, I'm so sorry."

353,Chandler,Oh yeah?
354,Chandler,Well thanks.
355,Ross,"So, so now do I get Joey?"
356,Chandler,"Okay, but you should know he eats five times a   day and shoves pennies up his nose."
