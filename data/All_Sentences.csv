2,Joey,I know.
3,Joey,Ross is getting married.
4,Chandler,"Phoebe is, making people."
5,Joey,Everybody's doing stuff!
6,Chandler,And we just sit here.
7,Chandler,"I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair!"
8,Chandler,"Look, we have to do something."
9,Chandler,Okay?
10,Chandler,Something huge!
11,Joey,We could climb Mt.
12,Joey,Everest!
13,Chandler,"No-no, not something stupid, something huge."
14,Joey,"No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday!"
15,Joey,We could totally do that!
16,Chandler,Why not?!
17,Chandler,"I mean it's just, it's just climbing!"
18,Chandler,"It's just, it's just steep!"
19,Joey,Yeah!
20,Chandler,We're going to Everest!

25,Joey,We're gonna climb Mt.
26,Joey,Everest!
27,Chandler,Yeah baby!
28,Phoebe,Really?!
29,Phoebe,I looked into that.
30,Phoebe,"Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y'know you can die."
31,Phoebe,"And, you would die!"
32,Chandler,"Yeah, well"
33,Joey,We could get that Everest video though.
34,Chandler,"Yeah, we could do that without y'know risking our lives at all!"
35,Joey,"And while we're down at the video store, you know what else we could rent?"
36,Joey,Die Hard!
37,Joey,"Oh, y'know what?"
38,Joey,"I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order."
39,Chandler,"Oh, well"
40,Phoebe,So you guys'll stay here and hang out with me?

48,Ross,"Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he's so cheap, he'd never fly to London in a million years."
49,Ross,"Yeah, invite him?"
50,Ross,"Hey, did I do these neat enough?"
51,Ross,Yeah?
52,Ross,Sure.
53,Ross,Why not?
54,Ross,Yeah?
55,Ross,"Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn't invite her?"
56,Ross,Yeah sure.
57,Ross,Huh?

63,Monica,Rachel?
64,Rachel,Oh God Monica hi!
65,Rachel,"I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!"
66,Monica,"Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor."
67,Monica,"This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?"
68,Rachel,"Hi, sure!"
69,Ross,Hi.
70,Ross,"You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you."
71,Rachel,I knew.
72,Ross,You did!
73,Ross,Oh....
74,Ross,I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
75,Rachel,I did.
76,Ross,Oh.
77,Ross,"Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor herebut do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?"
78,Ross,Sometime?
79,Ross,Maybe?
80,Rachel,"Yeah, maybe..."
81,Ross,"Okay... okay, maybe I will..."
82,Ross,"See, I see.... big passion in your future."
83,Rachel,Really?
84,Ross,I do.
85,Rachel,"Oh Ross, you're so great."
86,Joey,It's never gonna happen.
87,Ross,"Hey, I have a question."
88,Ross,"Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment."
89,Rachel,Okay.
90,Ross,Okay.
91,Ross,"Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um...."
92,Rachel,Ohhh!!!
93,Ross,"Yes, yes, that's right..."
94,Rachel,"Oh, look at the little cat!"
95,Rachel,Look at it!
96,Ross,What?
97,Ross,Ow!
98,Ross,"Monica, Joey, and"
99,Phoebe,"I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find..."
100,Rachel,"All right, listen, missy."
101,Rachel,"If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!"
102,Rachel,Yes!
103,Rachel,Did you see that?
104,Ross,You were incredible!
105,Ross,"Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen."
106,Rachel,I could not have done this without you.
107,Ross,"Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer?"
108,Ross,"I'm fine, I'm fine."
109,Ross,You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
110,Rachel,What?
111,Ross,I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
112,Rachel,"Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you."
113,Rachel,You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
114,Ross,The point is I...
115,Ross,"I don't need this right now, OK."
116,Ross,"It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy."
117,Ross,This ship has sailed.
118,Rachel,"Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross."
119,Ross,Fine.
120,Rachel,'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
121,Ross,Good.
122,Rachel,Good.
123,Rachel,Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about.
124,Rachel,This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at.
125,Rachel,I mean.
126,Rachel,if you don't get that...
127,Ross,"No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time."
128,Ross,"And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine!"
129,Ross,"Okay, I don't know what to do anymore."
130,Rachel,Well neither do I!
131,Ross,Is this about Mark?
132,Rachel,Oh my God.
133,Ross,"Okay, it's not, it's not."
134,Rachel,Oh my God.
135,Rachel,"I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard."
136,Ross,"Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard."
137,Ross,"Okay, what do you want me to do."
138,Rachel,"I don't know, I don't know."
139,Rachel,Urrrgh!
140,Rachel,"Look, maybe we should take a break."
141,Ross,"Okay, okay, fine, you're right."

156,Rachel,Can I be your girlfriend again?
157,Ross,"Yes, you can, very much."
158,Ross,Ahhhh!
159,Rachel,"Y'know what, I want you to leave!"
160,Rachel,Get outta here!

176,Rachel,"You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!!"
177,Rachel,How was she?
178,Ross,She was...
179,Joey,Awful!
180,Joey,Horrible!
181,Chandler,She was not good.
182,Chandler,Not good.
183,Joey,She was nothing compared to you.
184,Ross,"She, she was different."
185,Joey,Ewwwww!
186,Chandler,Uh-oh.
187,Rachel,Good different?
188,Ross,Nobody likes change.
189,Ross,What?
190,Ross,"Okay, okay, okay, okay."
191,Rachel,"...the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown."
192,Rachel,Y'know?
193,Rachel,I mean my Mom never thought this would work out.
194,Rachel,"It was all, Once a cheater, always a cheater. Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective..."
195,Ross,WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!
196,Rachel,You seem to really like her.
197,Ross,"Yeah, I really do."
198,Ross,"Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment."
199,Rachel,"Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks."
200,Ross,You think?
201,Rachel,"Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip."
202,Ross,"Hey, you're right."
203,Rachel,Yeah.
204,Rachel,Commercial Break
205,Monica,"Ohh, this is soo amazing!"

222,Joey,We'll show him.
223,Phoebe,I'm so jealous you're all going!
224,Phoebe,I can't believe I never knew that you can't fly in your third trimester!
225,Chandler,I didn't know that.
226,Monica,I never knew that either.
227,Joey,I knew that!
228,Joey,"I sooo didn't know that, but you should see your faces."
229,Rachel,Hey guys!
230,Rachel,What's up?
231,Joey,Heyyy.
232,Monica,We're hanging out.
233,Rachel,What's this?
234,Rachel,Is this Ross's wedding invitation?

236,Rachel,"Oh, no!"
237,Rachel,No you guys!
238,Rachel,"Come on, you don't have to do that!"
239,Rachel,I'm happy for him!

242,Monica,I'm sorry honey.
243,Rachel,Yeah.
244,Monica,"Rach, you're gonna come though aren't you?"
245,Rachel,"Oh, honey, I don't know."
246,Chandler,"This isn't one of those uh, y'know ""If she doesn't come, we-we don't, we don't come?"""
247,Chandler,Right?
248,Chandler,Because I already bought my ticket
249,Monica,You know what would be real weird?
250,Monica,Is if you weren't there.
251,Monica,"Just say you'll think about it, okay?"
252,Rachel,"No, I'll think about it."
253,Rachel,Yeah.
254,Rachel,Who's this from?
255,Chandler,"Oh, that's Ross's."
256,Rachel,Oh...  Oh my God.
257,Rachel,He remembered.
258,Phoebe,Remembered what?
259,Rachel,It was like months ago.
260,Rachel,"We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl."
261,Rachel,Oh!
262,Rachel,I can't believe he remembered!
263,Phoebe,"Oh, it's so pretty."
264,Phoebe,This must have cost him a fortune.
265,Monica,I can't believe he did this.
266,Chandler,"Come on, Ross?"
267,Chandler,"Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?"
268,Rachel,What did you just say?
269,Chandler,F-hah.... flennin....
270,Rachel,Oh.... my God.
271,Rachel,Oh my God.
272,Ross,But we haven't seen each other since then.
273,Ross,"Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig."
274,Rachel,Julie!
275,Rachel,"Julie, isn't that great?"
276,Rachel,"I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?"
277,Ross,"Oh, that is so sweet."
278,Ross,"No, no, ok, you hang up."
279,Ross,"Ok, ok, one, two, three."
280,Ross,Well you didn't hang up either.
281,Rachel,She didn't hang up either...
282,Ross,"Ok, no, no, you hang up."
283,Ross,"You, you, y"
284,Rachel,"Ross, hi, it's Rachel."
285,Rachel,"I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat......I am over you."
286,Rachel,"I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure."
287,Ross,"Rach, I got a message from you."
288,Rachel,Oh my God.
289,Rachel,"Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the."
290,Ross,You're over me?
291,Rachel,Ohhhhhhhh God.
292,Ross,"Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?"
293,Rachel,"Ohh, ohh."
294,Ross,"When, when were you... under me?"
295,Rachel,"Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you."
296,Ross,"OK, I need to lie down."
297,Joey,He broke up with Julie.
298,Joey,"Well, go hug her, for god's sakes."
299,Rachel,Really?
300,Ross,Really.
301,Ross,"It's always been you, Rach."
302,Rachel,"Oh, god."
303,Rachel,Chandler and
304,Joey,Ohhh.
305,Ross,"I've no idea, could be."
306,Ross,"Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight."
307,Rachel,"Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight."
308,Rachel,"Ah, oh God."
309,Rachel,"Oh, honey, oh that's OK."
310,Ross,What.
311,Ross,"Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box."
312,Ross,Gunther!
313,Ross,Gunther.
314,Ross,"Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place."
315,Ross,"Y'know, hey!"
316,Ross,"You're the one who ended it, remember?"
317,Rachel,"Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!"
318,Ross,You still love me?
319,Rachel,Noo.
320,Ross,What does this mean?
321,Ross,"What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?"
322,Rachel,Noo!
323,Rachel,Maybe!
324,Rachel,"I, I don't know."
325,Ross,What?
326,Rachel,"I just, I feel, I-I just..."
327,Rachel,Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again!
328,Rachel,We are so over!
329,Ross,FINE BY ME!
330,Rachel,And hey!
331,Rachel,"Just so you know, it's not that common!"
332,Rachel,It doesn't happen to every guy!
333,Rachel,And it is a big deal!
334,Chandler,I KNEW IT!!!
335,Rachel,Oh my God.
336,Monica,"You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom."
337,Rachel,Oh.
338,Ross,"You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this."
339,Monica,"Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds."
340,Chandler,"Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?"
341,Monica,"Oh, dad, turn it off."
342,Monica,Mr.
343,Joey,Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
344,Rachel,"I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late."
345,Monica,If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
346,Monica,Mrs.
347,Ross,Y'know what?
348,Ross,"I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off."
349,Ross,"OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright."
350,Ross,Mr.
351,Ross,Okay dad.
352,Ross,Mr.
353,Monica,I can't believe you did that.
354,Ross,"Yeah, well."
355,Phoebe,"See, he's her lobster."
356,Monica,Nooooo.
357,Monica,You're really not going?
358,Rachel,Yeah.
359,Rachel,It's just gonna be too hard.
360,Rachel,Y'know?
361,Rachel,"I mean, it's Ross."
362,Rachel,How can I watch him get married?
363,Rachel,"Y'know it's just, it's for the best, y'know it is, it's Y'know, plus, somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe!"
364,Rachel,"Y'know she's gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour."
365,Monica,You don't have a car.
366,Monica,And your license expired.
367,Rachel,I know.
368,Rachel,"Yeah, see, there's so much to do and I have so little time to do it in."
369,Rachel,Closing Credits
370,Chandler,"All right, check it out."
371,Chandler,Check this out.
372,Chandler,It says here that there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums!
373,Chandler,"""It's almost as good as being there."""
374,Joey,It's better!
375,Joey,You can't go to a museum in your underwear!
376,Chandler,"Well, You could, but... probably just the one time."
377,Joey,"I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!"
378,Chandler,"If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard."
379,Joey,Oh-ho!
380,Joey,I bet the British version is gooooood!
381,Joey,End

1,Ross,Happy Thanksgiving!
2,Chandler,"No, no, no."
3,Chandler,No-no-no.
4,Chandler,"Joey, Rachel, and"
5,Phoebe,Shhhh!
6,Ross,"What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?"
7,Chandler,"No, we're playing this game I learned at work."
8,Chandler,You have to name all the states in six minutes.
9,Ross,What?
10,Ross,That's like insanely easy!
11,Chandler,"Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds."
12,Chandler,"You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen ."
13,Monica,"It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose."
14,Ross,What?
15,Ross,You forgot fourteen states?
16,Monica,Nobody cares about the Dakotas.
17,Chandler,"Oh, okay, time's up!"
18,Rachel,"All right, I got 48."
19,Chandler,"Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?"
20,Phoebe,"Oh, I got tired of naming states."
21,Phoebe,"So I decided to list the types of celery, and I have"
22,Chandler,"Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead invegetables, Joey?"
23,Joey,Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
24,Ross,"Wow, how many have you got?"
25,Joey,Fifty-six!
26,Joey,Opening Credits
27,Joey,Hey!
28,Joey,How is New England not a state?
29,Joey,Huh?
30,Joey,They have a sports-team!
31,Chandler,Does South Oregon have a sports-team?
32,Chandler,There you go.
33,Rachel,How come we have one extra place setting?
34,Monica,'Cause you invited your assistant.
35,Rachel,"Oh, right."
36,Rachel,Sorry.
37,Rachel,"But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her."
38,Monica,Oh!
39,Monica,Why didn't you tell me?
40,Monica,I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
41,Rachel,"Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things."
42,Monica,"Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake,  but I still do."
43,Phoebe,Regular Celery!
44,Phoebe,"Oh, I already have that."
45,Ross,Done!
46,Ross,With time a-to-spare.
47,Chandler,Oooh that may be a New World's record
48,Ross,"You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states."
49,Ross,"Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called ""a globe?"""
50,Ross,Hmm?
51,Chandler,"Uh, Magellan?"
52,Chandler,You got 46 states.
53,Ross,What?
54,Ross,That's impossible.
55,Joey,46.
56,Joey,Wow!
57,Joey,"Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?"
58,Monica,"All right, I'm out of oven space."
59,Monica,I'm gonna turn on Joey's.
60,Monica,"Please, watch him!"
61,Monica,Do not let Joey eat any of the food!
62,Chandler,I am only one man!
63,Chandler,"Okay Ross, time is up!"
64,Ross,"No, just give me another minute."
65,Chandler,"Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay?"
66,Chandler,That is the beauty of this game.
67,Chandler,It makes you want to kill yourself.
68,Ross,This-this is crazy!
69,Ross,I can do this!
70,Ross,"All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner."
71,Chandler,"Okay, but if you can'tno dinner!"
72,Ross,You're on!
73,Joey,All right.
74,Joey,"Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have."
75,Monica,"Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?"
76,Joey,"But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?"
77,Monica,"Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?"
78,Ross,Pshhshhh!
79,Monica,Chandler?
80,Monica,Can you give me a hand?
81,Chandler,"Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment."
82,Joey,"Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States."
83,Phoebe,Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
84,Ross,"Phoebe, why is your bag moving?"
85,Phoebe,"Oh, it's not!"
86,Rachel,"Seriously, it's moving!"
87,Joey,What the hell is in there?
88,Phoebe,It's just my knitting that's all!
89,Phoebe,Yes!
90,Phoebe,I knit this.
91,Phoebe,I'm very good.
92,Monica,Ross's apartment is nice!
93,Monica,How come we don't hang out here more often?
94,Chandler,I don't know.
95,Chandler,Maybe it's because it smells a little weird.
96,Chandler,It's like old pumpkins or something.
97,Monica,That's my pie!
98,Chandler,Which smells delicious!
99,Monica,Uh-oh!
100,Monica,Uh-oh!
101,Chandler,What?
102,Monica,We left Joey alone with the food!
103,Monica,Yep!
104,Monica,"Yep, I knew it!"
105,Monica,There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!
106,Phoebe,Hi Geller-Bing residence.
107,Phoebe,How can I help?
108,Monica,"Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?"
109,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, who's this?"
110,Monica,"Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!"
111,Chandler,"Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!"
112,Phoebe,"No, there's no dog here?"
113,Monica,Yes there is!
114,Monica,He's black and white and shaggy and  he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
115,Phoebe,Oh my god!
116,Phoebe,Where are you?
117,Monica,I'll be right there!
118,Phoebe,They're here already?
119,Phoebe,How are they doing this?
120,Rachel,Hi Tag!
121,Rachel,What are you doing here?
122,Rachel,"Well, sure!"
123,Rachel,Come in!
124,Rachel,"Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?"
125,Rachel,"Oh, I'm sorry."
126,Ross,Ohio!!
127,Ross,Thank you!
128,Chandler,Huh!
129,Chandler,Where is the dog?
130,Ross,What dog?
131,Ross,There-there's no dog here.
132,Joey,Yeah that dog left!
133,Monica,Phoebe!
134,Monica,"Phoebe, open up!"
135,Phoebe,There's no dog in here.
136,Chandler,"Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!"
137,Phoebe,No that's just me coughing!
138,Phoebe,"Oh, good, there you are!"
139,Phoebe,"Listen, um, I have a dog in my room."
140,Chandler,What is it doing here?
141,Phoebe,"Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town."
142,Phoebe,Wait.
143,Phoebe,"Hello, my name is Clunkers."
144,Phoebe,May I please stay with you nice people?
145,Monica,"Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!"
146,Chandler,"Extremely allergic, okay?"
147,Chandler,"If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!"
148,Phoebe,"That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days"
149,Chandler,Really?
150,Monica,"Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?"
151,Chandler,"Well, it still has to go, right?"
152,Chandler,Monica and
153,Phoebe,Why?
154,Chandler,"Okay, it's um"
155,Joey,Don't do it!
156,Monica,Don't do what?
157,Chandler,I have to!
158,Chandler,Okay?
159,Chandler,It's time!
160,Chandler,"Okay, I hate dogs."
161,Phoebe,Are you crazy?
162,Ross,Are you out of your mind?
163,Phoebe,Why?
164,Joey,Told ya.
165,Chandler,"They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit."
166,Ross,"Right, they are scary."
167,Ross,"Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!"
168,Rachel,Wait a minute.
169,Rachel,Do you not like all dogs?
170,Rachel,"I mean, not even puppies?"
171,Chandler,Is there a puppy here?
172,Chandler,"Okay, you are new!"
173,Joey,"Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing."
174,Joey,It's like Ross not likin' ice cream.
175,Phoebe,You don't like ice cream?
176,Ross,It's too cold.
177,Chandler,"Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable."
178,Ross,It hurts my teeth.
179,Chandler,"And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore."
180,Chandler,"Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go."
181,Chandler,Oh my god!
182,Ross,How can I not get this?
183,Ross,I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.
184,Monica,1250.
185,Ross,"Damn, I forgot you were here."
186,Phoebe,All right.
187,Phoebe,We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross's.
188,Phoebe,We'll be back in a minute.
189,Rachel,"Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?"
190,Monica,Yeah.
191,Rachel,"When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?"
192,Phoebe,"Oh, I'd say about a month."
193,Monica,Really?
194,Monica,I'd say 3 to 4.
195,Joey,Half hour.
196,Rachel,Interesting.
197,Monica,"When it's your assistant, I would say never."
198,Joey,"All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you?"
199,Joey,All right?
200,Joey,"Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point."
201,Rachel,Huh.
202,Rachel,A moo-point?
203,Joey,"Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion."
204,Joey,It just doesn't matter.
205,Joey,It's moo.
206,Rachel,"Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?"
207,Monica,"Please, don't listen to Joey, okay."
208,Monica,Would you look at him?
209,Monica,He-he's obviously depressed.
210,Monica,He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers.
211,Monica,What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
212,Rachel,"You're right, I'm sorry."
213,Rachel,Thank you.
214,Rachel,"Okay, that's what I'm gonna do."
215,Joey,Fine!
216,Joey,Take their advice.
217,Joey,No one ever listens to me.
218,Joey,"When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside."
219,Rachel,Hey!
220,Rachel,How are you holding up?
221,Rachel,Yeah?
222,Rachel,I'm sorry about your girlfriend.
223,Rachel,So were you guys together a long time?
224,Rachel,Now that she broke up with you?
225,Rachel,Yeah.
226,Rachel,Hmmmm.
227,Rachel,"NoYeah, all the time, constantly."
228,Rachel,It's terrifying.
229,Rachel,But you know that I figure itit has to work out.
230,Rachel,"Because, uhit has to."
231,Rachel,"Yeah, I know, I do."
232,Rachel,I really do.
233,Rachel,"Well, what is a boss for?"
234,Rachel,Hug it out!
235,Joey,"All right, he likes you back!"
236,Joey,Huh?
237,Joey,"Told ya, you should go for it!"
238,Joey,Street noise drowned any of that out?
239,Joey,"No, all right, I see you later, okay...   Commercial Break"
240,Rachel,"Uh, yeah, well, see, he Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, andyou're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!"
241,Rachel,No?
242,Rachel,"All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you."
243,Rachel,"Yeah, I admit it."
244,Rachel,"I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable."
245,Rachel,Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
246,Rachel,What?
247,Rachel,"Okay, that's gonna take them a minute."
248,Rachel,Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
249,Rachel,"Wait, we still have time to talk and they're-they're not even in the car yet!"
250,Rachel,"Oh look, there they go, okay."
251,Monica,"Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now."
252,Phoebe,"Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely."
253,Monica,Stop it.
254,Monica,Stop!
255,Monica,Okay let's go.
256,Monica,We can be strong.
257,Phoebe,"Yeah, okay."
258,Monica,Oh my god!
259,Monica,Did you hear that?
260,Monica,She said Monica!
261,Monica,"Oooh, I can't leave her!"
262,Phoebe,"You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know."
263,Monica,That's not gonna work.
264,Phoebe,I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea.
265,Phoebe,He's not so smart.
266,Monica,Hey!
267,Monica,I didn't know either.
268,Phoebe,"Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?"
269,Monica,"Yeah, I knew."
270,Phoebe,Where's Chandler?
271,Chandler,Here I am.
272,Phoebe,Wash your hands!!
273,Chandler,How did youknow?
274,Ross,Hey!
275,Ross,What's she doing back here?
276,Monica,"Relax, Ross."
277,Monica,She's not made of ice cream!
278,Ross,"Hey look, Phoebe."
279,Ross,"I, uh, I laid out the states geographically..."
280,Phoebe,"No, no, we don't really have time for this right now."
281,Phoebe,"Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom."
282,Ross,"Yeah, but, but look what I'm..."
283,Phoebe,"See, this is exactly what we do not have time for."
284,Chandler,Where's Monica?
285,Ross,"Um, in Phoebe's room."
286,Ross,You can't go in there.
287,Chandler,Why not?
288,Ross,Monica's crying.
289,Ross,She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.
290,Chandler,"Well, I, I should go in there."
291,Ross,No.
292,Ross,"No, no."
293,Ross,She doesn't want to see you right now.
294,Chandler,Why not?
295,Ross,Because you sent away the dog!
296,Chandler,This is ridiculous.
297,Ross,"Oh, is it?"
298,Ross,Is it?
299,Ross,"Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover."
300,Ross,"And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs."
301,Ross,So Monica and her friendPhyllistake away the dog.
302,Ross,And that was the last time we ever saw him.
303,Ross,Don't you see?
304,Ross,This is just like that.
305,Ross,Only with a few details changed.
306,Joey,"Okay, I'm in my sweat pants."
307,Joey,Bring on the food!
308,Joey,What's the matter?
309,Chandler,"Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away."
310,Joey,So?
311,Joey,"Bring the dog back, you're a hero."
312,Chandler,"Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that."
313,Chandler,"I could, I could do..."
314,Chandler,"I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?"
315,Joey,"Chandler, it's like a big gerbil."
316,Chandler,And that doesn't scare you?
317,Joey,"Ross, you need some help?"
318,Ross,From you?
319,Ross,"Yes, please!"
320,Joey,"First of all, Utah?"
321,Joey,"Dude, you can't just make stuff up!"
322,Ross,I hate America!
323,Ross,"When I finish this game, I swear I am moving."
324,Joey,Hey!
325,Joey,Tag's still talking to the police.
326,Rachel,"Yeah, ohh!"
327,Rachel,"Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth?"
328,Rachel,I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you.
329,Rachel,"Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out"
330,Joey,"If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah."
331,Phoebe,"Hey, is Chandler here?"
332,Chandler,"No, no he went for a walk."
333,Phoebe,"Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!"
334,Rachel,Hi!
335,Joey,Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
336,Joey,He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
337,Phoebe,"Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!"
338,Joey,You think?
339,Monica,"Hi, honey."
340,Chandler,"Please, please, please, don't be mad at me."
341,Monica,What?
342,Monica,"Why, why would..."
343,Phoebe,"Shh, wait and see."
344,Phoebe,"Maybe we will, maybe we won't."
345,Chandler,"Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers."
346,Chandler,"Y'know, for you, and I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed."
347,Chandler,"I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry."
348,Chandler,But I do know where we could all go ease the pain.
349,Phoebe,"We have good news, look whose back!"
350,Rachel,Hi!
351,Chandler,Clunkers?!
352,Chandler,Oh my god!
353,Monica,"That's right, she came back all by herself."
354,Phoebe,It's a Thanksgiving miracle!
355,Chandler,It is so good to see you!
356,Phoebe,"Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building."
357,Phoebe,"Oh, the things she must have seen!"
358,Phoebe,"And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in I went to far, didn't I?"
359,Phoebe,When should I have stopped?
360,Ross,"Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states."
361,Ross,"Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more!"
362,Ross,"I-I think, I should be able to eat something."
363,Chandler,It's up to you.
364,Rachel,"Oh, hi!"
365,Rachel,How are you doing?
366,Rachel,Oh.
367,Ross,Tag?
368,Ross,Y-You're going?
369,Ross,"Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk."
370,Ross,"Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?"
371,Ross,"Ah, what good are you."
372,Rachel,"Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace."
373,Rachel,"Ah, I-I never should have said what I said."
374,Rachel,Ity'know what?
375,Rachel,It just doesn't matter how I feel.
376,Rachel,"I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay?"
377,Rachel,Big day Monday lots to do.
378,Rachel,"So, we're okay?"
379,Rachel,"Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out."

52,Phoebe,I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
53,Rachel,I know.
54,Phoebe,"What, so what are you gonna tell him?"
55,Rachel,"Well, I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no."
56,Phoebe,Huh.
57,Rachel,I mean I think I'd say no to anybody right now.
58,Rachel,"Oh, but it was so strange."
59,Rachel,"I mean I'm standing there with this charming, cute guy, who's asking me to go out with him, which I'm allowed to do, and I felt guilty."
60,Rachel,"Y'know, like I'd be cheating on Ross or something."
61,Phoebe,Wow.
62,Phoebe,"So, okay, maybe that means that, you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father."
63,Rachel,I don't have any issues with my Father.
64,Phoebe,"Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing then."
65,Joey,I hate this woman!!
66,Joey,I hate her!
67,Joey,"She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks."
68,Joey,"Okay, and whenever I can't do it, they're all like-like laughing at me."
69,Ross,Hello.
70,Ross,Chandler and
71,Joey,Hey!
72,Ross,So Rachel called.
73,Ross,Wants to see me.
74,Ross,Going over in a minute.
75,Joey,"Wow, what-what do you think she wants?"
76,Ross,"Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks."
77,Chandler,It's possible.
78,Chandler,"You are very loveable, I'd miss you if I broke up with you."
79,Chandler,I was just trying to be supportive.
80,Ross,Then be supportive like a guy.
81,Chandler,"If I broke up with you, I'd miss you."
82,Ross,Hi.
83,Rachel,Hi!
84,Ross,"You ah, wanted to see me?"
85,Rachel,Yeah.
86,Rachel,"Ahh, here's a box of your stuff."
87,Ross,What?
88,Rachel,"Oh, y'know, it's just like hats, and a shirt, and CD's, just sort of stuff that you've left here."
89,Ross,What are you doing?
90,Ross,Are you trying to hurt me?
91,Ross,Or something?
92,Rachel,No.
93,Rachel,"Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it's time we-we y'know, move on."
94,Rachel,"I mean, I mean don't' you think?"
95,Ross,Yes.
96,Rachel,Yeah?
97,Ross,"Yes, I do."
98,Rachel,Good.
99,Ross,"Yeah, I-I really do."
100,Ross,Hey!
101,Ross,This-this was a gift?
102,Rachel,"Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop."
103,Ross,It's still a gift!
104,Ross,I got it from the gift shop!
105,Rachel,"Okay, all right, give me the mug!"
106,Rachel,I'll keep the mug.
107,Ross,No!!
108,Ross,Y'know-y'know don't do me any favours.
109,Ross,"In fact, where, where's the rest of my stuff?!"
110,Ross,Huh?
111,Ross,"Like-like my umm,  Hey, this book is mine!!"
112,Ross,"And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in?"
113,Ross,I'd like that back too.
114,Ross,"Yes, I do."
115,Rachel,You know how much I love that T-shirt!
116,Rachel,You never even where that T-shirt!
117,Ross,"I'm just trying to help you, move on."
118,Rachel,"Oh, you are a petty man."
119,Rachel,"You are a petty, petty...."
120,Ross,Petty...
121,Rachel,Petty...
122,Ross,Petty...
123,Rachel,Petty...
124,Ross,Petty...
125,Rachel,Small...
126,Ross,Small...
127,Rachel,You are so just doing this out of spite.
128,Ross,"Awwwahuh, no, no, no!"
129,Rachel,Huh?
130,Ross,I'm-I'm gonna wear this all the time!
131,Ross,I love this shirt!
132,Rachel,You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!!
133,Rachel,It doesn't even fit you anymore!
134,Ross,"Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah..."
135,Rachel,yeah-yeah-yeah!
136,Ross,"Oh-oh, okay, okay!"
137,Ross,"If you don't mind I'm gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt."
138,Ross,You have a pleasant evening.
139,Phoebe,"So, you're like a zillionaire?"
140,Chandler,And you're our age.
141,Chandler,You're our age.
142,Phoebe,"Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself."
143,Phoebe,"Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete."
144,Joey,"Oh, oh, I got it!"
145,Joey,Pete-Chicago.
146,Chandler,That's not a state Joe.
147,Joey,"Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?"
148,Chandler,You're our age!
149,Monica,Absolutely!
150,Monica,Now get out of here you!!
151,Monica,"Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him!"
152,Monica,"Look, is there something wrong with me?"
153,Monica,I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future?
154,Monica,"Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on!"
155,Monica,"I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?"
156,Phoebe,"Yeah, kinda."
157,Joey,"Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be!"
158,Joey,Huh?
159,Joey,Because I sure as hell can't figure it out!
160,Joey,I talk to you and nothin'.
161,Joey,"You look at me, and it's nothin'."
162,Joey,Nothing.
163,Joey,The
164,Joey,Yeah.
165,Joey,"Oh, hey, how about this one."
166,Joey,"Ah, it's says so in the script!"
167,Joey,"Y'know ah, I-I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch."
168,Joey,It does in mine!
169,Chandler,I can blow dry it.
170,Chandler,I can put gel on it.
171,Chandler,"It doesn't matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head."
172,Chandler,It's so annoying.
173,Chandler,Does it bug you?
174,Ross,You bug me.
175,Chandler,Is there any chance you didn't see that?
176,Chandler,Commercial Break
177,Chandler,Ross!
178,Chandler,You gotta stop!
179,Chandler,Okay?!
180,Chandler,You can't just stare through the peep hole for three hours!
181,Chandler,You're gonna get peep eye!
182,Ross,I knew it!
183,Ross,I knew it!
184,Ross,I always knew she liked him!
185,Ross,"Y'know, she'd say no, but here we are!"
186,Ross,Right?
187,Ross,"We just broke up, first thing she does!"
188,Chandler,You didn't just break up.
189,Ross,"Hey, it's been like three weeks!"
190,Chandler,You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up.
191,Chandler,I mean bullets have left guns slower!
192,Ross,"Here they come, here they come."
193,Ross,"Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I'm gonna kill myself, I swear."
194,Ross,"I can't, I can't watch this."
195,Ross,"Come on, date over!"
196,Ross,Date over!
197,Ross,"Uh-oh, here we go, she's going in."
198,Chandler,Okay.
199,Ross,She's going in.
200,Ross,Wait!
201,Ross,He's going in!
202,Ross,He's going in!!
203,Ross,The door's closed!
204,Ross,"I, I can't see anything but the door closed!"
205,Chandler,And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
206,Ross,"Okay, I have to do something."
207,Ross,"I mean, I have, I have to stop it!"
208,Chandler,Stop what?
209,Ross,"I don't know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it."
210,Ross,I'll go over and I will borrow something.
211,Ross,Juice!!
212,Ross,I need juice!
213,Chandler,No!!
214,Chandler,You can't!
215,Ross,"Look, they must be stopped!"
216,Chandler,"I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!!"
217,Chandler,You are surprisingly strong!
218,Ross,I need juice!
219,Ross,People need juice!
220,Chandler,Look man!
221,Ross,People need juice!
222,Chandler,Listen to me!
223,Ross,"Juice, I need..."
224,Chandler,She's moving on!
225,Chandler,"Okay, if it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else!"
226,Chandler,"And unless you're thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over!"
227,Chandler,"Okay, man?"
228,Chandler,It's over.
229,Ross,"Yeah, okay."
230,Chandler,Okay.
231,Ross,It's just I miss her so much.
232,Chandler,I know.
233,Rachel,Oh.
234,Rachel,That's so Monica can keep track.
235,Rachel,"That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, Where's number 27?!'"
236,Rachel,Y'know what?
237,Rachel,I can't do this.
238,Rachel,"Well, oh, Mark, I'm doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know?"
239,Rachel,I'm just doing it to get back at Ross.
240,Rachel,"I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you."
241,Rachel,Oh God.
242,Rachel,I'm sorry about this.
243,Rachel,You sure?
244,Monica,Sure.
245,Monica,"Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I'm gonna say, midget rodeo."
246,Monica,Okay.
247,Monica,"Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship."
248,Monica,So I did tell you.
249,Monica,"Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing."
250,Monica,"Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me."
251,Monica,Y'know what I mean?
252,Monica,I so wanna be attracted to you.
253,Monica,I'm sorry.
254,Monica,It's not?
255,Monica,"Well, um, look I-I don't want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted too."
256,Chandler,I don't think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in.
257,Chandler,Draw!
258,Chandler,I wasn't doing anything.
259,Chandler,"Uh-oh, what did she do now?"
260,Joey,"Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she's like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!"
261,Chandler,"Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth."
262,Joey,"God, I just, I hate her!"
263,Joey,I hate her!!
264,Joey,"With her, Oh, I'm so talented.'"
265,Joey,"and Oh, I'm so pretty,' and Ooh, I smell so good.'"
266,Chandler,I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
267,Joey,"Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?!"
268,Joey,Y'know?
269,Chandler,I'm talking about you.
270,Chandler,"You big, big freak."
271,Joey,Oh.
272,Joey,Ohh.
273,Joey,"Ohh, you're out of your mind."
274,Chandler,"Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours!"
275,Chandler,If you were in a school yard you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
276,Joey,"Oh, yeah?!"
277,Joey,Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?
278,Joey,"Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be!"
279,Joey,Huh?
280,Joey,Because I sure as hell can't figure it out!
281,Joey,I talk to you and it's nothin'.
282,Joey,"You look at me, and nothin'."
283,Joey,Nothing.
284,Joey,The
285,Joey,Better?
286,Joey,"Ah, Kate?"
287,Joey,"You ah, you forgot your shoes."
288,Joey,"Hey, listen you ah...."
289,Joey,...feel like getting a cup of coffee?
290,Joey,"Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight."
291,Phoebe,Hey!
292,Phoebe,Why isn't it Spiderman?
293,Phoebe,"Y'know like Goldman, Silverman..."
294,Chandler,Cause it's-it's not his last name.
295,Phoebe,It isn't?
296,Chandler,"No, it's not like, like Phil Spiderman."
297,Chandler,"He's a spider, man."
298,Chandler,"Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there's no Gold Man."
299,Phoebe,"Oh, okay."
300,Phoebe,There should be Gold Man!
301,Rachel,Hey!
302,Monica,"Hey, Rach, how was work?"
303,Rachel,"Oh, great."
304,Rachel,Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
305,Monica,"By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff."
306,Rachel,"Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming."
307,Rachel,"I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and..."
308,Monica,Something wrong?
309,Rachel,No.
310,Rachel,Nothing.
311,Rachel,Closing Credits
312,Chandler,"So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?"
313,Phoebe,"Okay well, he would turn things to gold."
314,Chandler,What about things that are already gold?
315,Phoebe,"Ahh, his work is done."
316,Chandler,"Okay, let's play my game now."
317,Phoebe,Okay.
318,Phoebe,All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!!
319,Phoebe,End

1,Rachel,No.
2,Phoebe,"Tell him, tell him."
3,Monica,Just...please tell him.
4,Rachel,Shut up!
5,Chandler,Tell me what?
6,Monica,"Look at you, you won't even look at him."
7,Chandler,"Oh, come on tell me."
8,Chandler,I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
9,Rachel,"All right, all right, all right."
10,Rachel,"Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were..."
11,Phoebe,Doing it on this table.
12,Chandler,Wow!
13,Joey,Exellent dream score.
14,Ross,"Why, why, why would you dream that?"
15,Chandler,"More importantly, was I any good?"
16,Rachel,"Well, you were pretty damn good."
17,Chandler,"Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate."
18,Rachel,"Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table."
19,Ross,"I love it, when we share."
20,Chandler,You're okay there?
21,Ross,I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
22,Chandler,"I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing."
23,Chandler,I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
24,Chandler,Opening Credits
25,Chandler,Hello Rachel.
26,Rachel,Get off.
27,Phoebe,"Uh, uh, gimme."
28,Phoebe,Can you see me operating a drill press?
29,Joey,I don't know.
30,Joey,What are you wearing?
31,Ross,"Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?"
32,Phoebe,Just for some short-term-work.
33,Phoebe,"You know, until I get back some of my massage clients."
34,Chandler,Pirates again?
35,Phoebe,"No, nothing like that."
36,Phoebe,I was just...such a dummie.
37,Phoebe,"I taught this ""massage-yourself-at-home-workshop."""
38,Phoebe,And they are.
39,Joey,"Hey, hey, Chan."
40,Joey,She could work for you.
41,Chandler,"Thanks Joey, that's a good idea."
42,Phoebe,What...
43,Phoebe,"I could, I could do it."
44,Phoebe,What is it?
45,Chandler,"Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks."
46,Chandler,She is having one of her boobs redused.
47,Chandler,It's a whole big boob story.
48,Phoebe,I could be a secretary.
49,Chandler,"Well, you know Phoebs."
50,Chandler,"I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal."
51,Chandler,For a large portion of the day.
52,Phoebe,I could do that.
53,Rachel,What are you playing with?
54,Ross,"Oh, it's my new beeper."
55,Joey,What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
56,Monica,Is it like for dinosaur emergencies.
57,Monica,"'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'"
58,Ross,"No, it's for when Carol goes into labor."
59,Ross,She can get me wherever I am.
60,Ross,"I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO."
61,Chandler,"A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid."
62,Monica,"All right, I'll see you guys later."
63,Rachel,Off to see young Ethan?
64,Monica,Thank you.
65,Joey,How young is young Ethan?
66,Joey,Young?
67,Monica,He's... our age.
68,Chandler,When we were?
69,Monica,"Okay, he's a senior in college."
70,Ross,College?
71,Chandler,Whoa!
72,Chandler,And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
73,Monica,"No, of course not."
74,Monica,It's not even an issue.
75,Monica,Cause I told him I was 22.
76,Monica,"Oh, I can't pass for 22?"
77,Phoebe,"Well, maybe 25-26."
78,Monica,I am 26.
79,Phoebe,There you go.
80,Chandler,Can you hear that?
81,Phoebe,Yeah?
82,Chandler,See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
83,Phoebe,Oh.
84,Phoebe,"Uh, I'm on."
85,Phoebe,Mr. Bing's office.
86,Phoebe,"No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now."
87,Chandler,I'm not in a meeting.
88,Chandler,I'm right... Whoops.
89,Phoebe,Will he know what this is in reference to?
90,Phoebe,And he has your number?
91,Phoebe,"All right, I'll see that he gets the message."
92,Phoebe,Bye bye.
93,Chandler,What?
94,Phoebe,Ross says hi.
95,Chandler,Ah!
96,Phoebe,This is so fun.
97,Phoebe,"All right, what do we do now?"
98,Chandler,"Well, now, I actually have to get to work."
99,Phoebe,Most likely.
100,Phoebe,"Okay, I'm gonna be out there."
101,Chandler,Okay.
102,Phoebe,All right.
103,Phoebe,Bye bye.
104,Chandler,Bye bye.
105,Chandler,Yes?
106,Phoebe,Whatcha doin'?
107,Chandler,Ooh.
108,Monica,"Windows are clean, candels are lit."
109,Monica,"Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt."
110,Monica,Did I turn the fish?
111,Monica,"No, cause I made lasagne."
112,Monica,Am I out of control?
113,Rachel,Just a touch.
114,Rachel,"Mon, I don't understand."
115,Rachel,"I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms?"
116,Rachel,"I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh."
117,Monica,What?
118,Rachel,Could tonight be the Night?
119,Monica,I don't know.
120,Monica,Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know.
121,Monica,"Things happen, and they happen."
122,Monica,You don't plan these things.
123,Rachel,"So, did you shave your legs?"
124,Monica,Yeah.
125,Rachel,A-ha!
126,Joey,Would you let it go Ross.
127,Joey,It was just a dream.
128,Joey,It doesn't mean...
129,Ross,"Oh, oh."
130,Ross,"Oh, oh."
131,Ross,Oh this is it.
132,Ross,Oh my god it's baby time.
133,Ross,Baby time.
134,Joey,"All right, relax, relax."
135,Joey,"Just relax, just relax."
136,Joey,"Be cool, be cool."
137,Ross,"Yeah, hi, I was just beeped."
138,Ross,"No, André is not here."
139,Ross,Third time today.
140,Ross,"Yes, I'm sure... No, sir."
141,Ross,I don't perform those kind of services.
142,Joey,Services?
143,Joey,"Oh, services."
144,Ross,"Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO."
145,Ross,"Yeah, that's right."
146,Ross,"That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir."
147,Ross,"No, belive me, you don't want me."
148,Ross,"Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment."
149,Ross,"All rightie, bye bye."
150,Joey,"Hey, hey."
151,Joey,How was the first day?
152,Phoebe,"Oh, exellent."
153,Phoebe,"Everyone was so, so nice."
154,Chandler,"See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes."
155,Chandler,Me.
156,Phoebe,"No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you."
157,Chandler,Why not?
158,Phoebe,"Oh, because, you know... they don't like you."
159,Chandler,What?
160,Phoebe,I thought you knew that.
161,Chandler,Noho.
162,Chandler,Who doesn't they like me?
163,Phoebe,Everyone.
164,Phoebe,Except for uh... no everyone.
165,Chandler,What are you talking about?
166,Phoebe,Don't feel bad.
167,Phoebe,You know they used to like you a lot.
168,Phoebe,"But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like ""Mr. Boss Man""."
169,Phoebe,"You know, Mr. Bing."
170,Phoebe,"Mr. Bing, ""Boss Man Bing""."
171,Chandler,I can't belive it.
172,Phoebe,"Yeah, yeah."
173,Phoebe,They even do you.
174,Chandler,They do me?
175,Phoebe,You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
176,Chandler,I don't sound like that.
177,Ross,"Oh, oh Chandler..."
178,Joey,"Oh... Yeah, you do."
179,Ross,'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
180,Joey,My scones.
181,Joey,"Phoebe, Joey, and"
182,Ross,'My scones.'
183,Chandler,"Okay, I don't sound like that."
184,Chandler,That is so not true.
185,Chandler,"That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!"
186,Monica,Did not.
187,Monica,Young
188,Monica,How was that possible?
189,Monica,Young
190,Monica,Okay.
191,Monica,Young
192,Monica,Unless... Young
193,Monica,"Uh, ah."
194,Monica,Unless you wanna stay over?
195,Monica,"I mean, I'm going to, so... Young"
196,Monica,"Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'"
197,Monica,Young
198,Monica,Ethan?
199,Monica,Young
200,Monica,Are you a virgin?
201,Monica,Young
202,Monica,Really?
203,Monica,Young
204,Monica,You keep saying that.
205,Monica,Young
206,Monica,"Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you."
207,Monica,"And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to."
208,Monica,Young
209,Monica,No-no.
210,Monica,Nothing wrong about that.
211,Monica,Young

174,Chandler,What is it that I do?
175,Phoebe,Well it's just like you're trying too hard.
176,Phoebe,"Always making jokes, y'know, you justYou come off a little needy."

120,Phoebe,"Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England."
121,Phoebe,Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
122,Phoebe,I totally get symbolism.
123,Phoebe,The
124,Rachel,"Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story."
125,Rachel,The
126,Rachel,"Oh-oh-oh, symbolism!"

177,Joey,That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
178,Chandler,"No-no, wait!"
179,Chandler,There's got to be a better explanation.
180,Chandler,You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your  adult film class.
181,Joey,"Yeah, I like that."
182,Joey,"But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?"
183,Chandler,OhI don't know.

207,Ross,Dr.
208,Ross,You ate my sandwich?
209,Ross,Dr.

228,Rachel,Vogue!
229,Rachel,"Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman."
230,Phoebe,No!
231,Phoebe,You should've read it yourself!
232,Rachel,Come on Phoebe!
233,Rachel,Don't be such a goodie-goodie!
234,Phoebe,Fine!
235,Phoebe,"Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not."
236,Phoebe,She's a cyborg.
237,Rachel,A cyborg?!
238,Rachel,Isn't that like a robot?
239,Phoebe,"Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time."
240,Phoebe,The
241,Phoebe,"Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights."
242,Phoebe,The

258,Monica,Why?
259,Ross,On account of my rage.
260,Chandler,"Which I may say, right now, is out of control."
261,Ross,He gave me a pill for it.
262,Monica,A pill?
263,Ross,Uh-huh.
264,Ross,"Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer."
265,Ross,"And I thought was a good idea so, I took it."
266,Monica,"Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?"
267,Chandler,And you're okay with that?
268,Ross,I don't know.
269,Ross,"It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich."
270,Rachel,"Ugh, that was so embarrassing!"
271,Rachel,I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!
272,Phoebe,I'm sorry.

274,Rachel,That was not funny!
275,Phoebe,"Well, I snapped!"
276,Phoebe,Okay?
277,Phoebe,You weren't taking the class seriously.

281,Rachel,"Y'know, I thought it would be fun!"
282,Phoebe,"Well, yeah!"
283,Phoebe,"Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn."
284,Phoebe,"Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school."

340,Joey,Because you can also explain it with the truth!
341,Rachel,"Well, what is the truth?"
342,Ross,"Yeah, what's going on?"
343,Phoebe,What's going on?
344,Joey,I slept with Monica.
345,Chandler,Well let's.let's see what everybody thinks of that?
346,Monica,Oh no!
347,Ross,You slept with my sister?
348,Joey,"Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London."
349,Ross,This is not good for my rage.
350,Rachel,"Monica, is this true?"
351,Joey,Of course it's true!
352,Joey,How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
353,Monica,Yes it's true.
354,Rachel,"Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?"
355,Joey,Ahhoy!
356,Joey,That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London.
357,Joey,Right Monica?
358,Monica,I guess I wanted to keep it  as a souvenir.
359,Ross,My God Monica!
360,Chandler,Are you sure Joe?
361,Chandler,Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
362,Joey,No!
363,Joey,"If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica!"
364,Joey,Yeah.
365,Joey,Yeah.
366,Joey,She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
367,Phoebe,So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
368,Joey,That makes sense!
369,Rachel,And the video camera?
370,Joey,"Uhh, Monica?"
371,Monica,I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
372,Joey,But sadly I could not be enticed.
373,Ross,Unbelievable!
374,Ross,I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?!
375,Ross,Why?
376,Ross,Why would you do that?
377,Monica,I'm Monica.
378,Monica,I'm disgusting.
379,Monica,I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
380,Joey,"Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not."
381,Joey,Eh?
382,Joey,"All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket."

420,Ross,My hearing would be impaired.
421,Phoebe,I thought you were excellent!
422,Phoebe,"In fact for a minute there I was like, ""Ooh, where'd Ross go?"""
423,Ross,Thank you!
424,Ross,And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac
425,Phoebe,Yeah?
426,Ross,Oh my God.
427,Ross,I mean
428,Joey,Y'know what?
429,Joey,I think that's enough for today.
430,Joey,Thanks for your help!
431,Phoebe,He's holding us back.
432,Ross,Totally.
433,Ross,End
0,Ross,"Uh, Rach, we're running low on resumes over here."
1,Monica,Do you really want a job with Popular Mechanics?
2,Chandler,"Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for."
3,Rachel,"Hey, look, you guys, I'm going for anything here, OK?"
4,Rachel,"I cannot be a waitress anymore, I mean it."
5,Rachel,"I'm sick of the lousy tips, I'm sick of being called 'Excuse me...'"
6,Ross,"Rach, did you proofread these?"
7,Rachel,"Uh... yeah, why?"
8,Ross,"Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent compuper skills."
9,Rachel,Oh my Goood!
10,Rachel,"Oh, do you think it's on all of them?"
11,Joey,"Oh no, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few."
12,Joey,Opening Credits
13,Monica,"Hey, guys."
14,Monica,Chandler and
15,Ross,Hey.
16,Rachel,"Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything?"
17,Monica,Lots of responses.
18,Phoebe,Wow!
19,Rachel,What?
20,Rachel,Give me that!
21,Chandler,"You know, I can't believe you."
22,Chandler,Linda is so great!
23,Chandler,Why won't you go out with her again?
24,Ross,I don't know.
25,Chandler,Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
26,Ross,"No, it's not just that."
27,Ross,"It's justI want someone who... who does something for me, y'know?"
28,Ross,"Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh..."
29,Chandler,...little playthings with yarn?
30,Ross,What?
31,Chandler,Could you want her more?
32,Ross,Who?
33,Chandler,"Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening."
34,Ross,"Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just..."
35,Rachel,Hi!
36,Rachel,How are you?
37,Ross,"We're fine, we're fine."
38,Rachel,OK.
39,Joey,Shut up!
40,Chandler,We're notwe're not saying anything.
41,Phoebe,What?
42,Ross,Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
43,Joey,Thank you.
44,Chandler,"We were playing poker, alright..."
45,Joey,There was chocolate on the three.
46,Joey,"It looked like an eight, alright?"
47,Ross,"Oh, guys, you should've seen him."
48,Ross,'Read 'em and weep.'
49,Chandler,And then he did.
50,Rachel,"Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?"
51,Phoebe,"Yeah, what is that?"
52,Phoebe,"Like, some kind of guy thing?"
53,Phoebe,"Like, some kind of sexist guy thing?"
54,Phoebe,"Like it's poker, so only guys can play?"
55,Ross,"No, women are welcome to play."
56,Phoebe,"Oh, OK, so then what is it?"
57,Phoebe,"Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?"
58,Chandler,There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
59,Joey,"Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker."
60,Monica,"Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!"
61,Rachel,Really.
62,Monica,"I mean, that's a typical guy response."
63,Ross,"Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?"
64,Rachel,But you could teach us.
65,Chandler,"OK, so now we draw cards."
66,Monica,"So I wouldn't need any, right?"
67,Monica,Cause I have a straight.
68,Rachel,"Oh, good for you!"
69,Phoebe,Congratulations!
70,Chandler,"OK Phoebs, how many do you want?"
71,Phoebe,"OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs."
72,Ross,No.
73,Ross,"No, uh, Phoebs?"
74,Ross,You can'tyou can't do...
75,Rachel,"Oh wait, I have the ten of spades!"
76,Rachel,Here!
77,Ross,"No, no."
78,Ross,"Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that."
79,Rachel,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, I don't need them."
80,Rachel,I'm going for fours.
81,Ross,"Oh, you're..."
82,Monica,"Alright, here we go."
83,Monica,We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
84,Monica,Phoebe and
85,Rachel,OOooooo!
86,Joey,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'?"
87,Joey,This is a poker game.
88,Joey,You can't serve food with more than one syllable.
89,Joey,"It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz..."
90,Chandler,"OK, so at this point, the dealer..."
91,Monica,"Alright, you know, we got it, we got it."
92,Monica,Let's play for real.
93,Monica,High stakes... big bucks...
94,Ross,"Alright, now, you sure?"
95,Ross,Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...
96,Phoebe,But...
97,Phoebe,"I'm ready, so, just deal."
98,Chandler,"OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson."
99,Chandler,Joey... three... eight.
100,Chandler,Eight... three.
101,Chandler,"Alright babe, deal the cards."
102,Monica,"Dammit, dammit, dammit!"
103,Joey,About what?
104,Phoebe,About how good your cards were.
105,Joey,Heh...
106,Joey,I was bluffing.
107,Phoebe,A-ha!
108,Phoebe,And... what is bluffing?
109,Phoebe,Is it not another word for... lying?
110,Rachel,"OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow..."
111,Chandler,"Rach, Rach, we gotta settle."
112,Rachel,Settle what?
113,Chandler,The... Jamestown colony of Virginia.
114,Chandler,"You see, King George is giving us the land, so..."
115,Ross,"The game, Rachel, the game."
116,Ross,You owe us money for the game.
117,Rachel,Oh.
118,Rachel,Right.
119,Joey,"You know what, you guys?"
120,Joey,"It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?"
121,Monica,"Hell no, we'll pay!"
122,Phoebe,"OK, Monica?"
123,Phoebe,I had another answer all ready.
124,Monica,And you know what?
125,Monica,We want a rematch.
126,Ross,Well that's fine with me.
127,Ross,Could use the money.
128,Ross,...Yeah.
129,Chandler,"Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea."
130,Chandler,"You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less."
131,Ross,"Look, Rachel, this is poker."
132,Ross,"I play to win, alright?"
133,Ross,"In order for me to win, other people have to lose."
134,Ross,"So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK?"
135,Ross,Cause once those cards are dealt...
136,Joey,...Yeah?
137,Ross,I'm not a nice guy.
138,Ross,"Alright boys, let's eat."
139,Chandler,"Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?"
140,Ross,You still on that?
141,Chandler,"Oh, come on."
142,Chandler,What was with that whole Black Bart speech?
143,Ross,"You are way off, pal."
144,Joey,"No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her."
145,Ross,Um.... no.
146,Ross,"See, I might've had feelings for her at one timenot any more."
147,Ross,I justI...
148,Ross,Marcel!
149,Ross,Where are you going with that disc?
150,Ross,You are not putting that on again!
151,Ross,"Marcel, OKif you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble."
152,Rachel,Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
153,Monica,"Yeah, I know."
154,Monica,He can get really competitive.
155,Phoebe,Ha.
156,Phoebe,"Ha, ha."
157,Monica,What?
158,Phoebe,"Oh, hello, kettle?"
159,Phoebe,This is Monica.
160,Phoebe,You're black.
161,Monica,Please!
162,Monica,I am not as bad as Ross.
163,Rachel,"Oh, I beg to differ."
164,Rachel,The Pictionary incident?
165,Monica,That was not an incident!
166,Monica,"I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand."
167,Rachel,Oooooh.
168,Monica,You're kidding!
169,Monica,Where?
170,Monica,Where?
171,Monica,"Oh, Rachel!"
172,Phoebe,"Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home."
173,Monica,"Well, what's the job?"
174,Rachel,Assistant buyer.
175,Rachel,Oh!
176,Rachel,I would be shopping... for a living!
177,Monica,"OK, look."
178,Monica,That is Aunt Iris.
179,Monica,This woman has been playing poker since she was five.
180,Monica,You gotta listen to every word she says.
181,Monica,Hi!
182,Monica,Aunt
183,Rachel,No.
184,Monica,I don't think so.
185,Rachel,Why?
186,Rachel,Aunt
187,Monica,What?
188,Rachel,Oh my God!
189,Monica,Really?
190,Monica,Aunt
191,Phoebe,Thank y...  Aunt
192,Monica,"Uh, Aunt Iris?"
193,Monica,"This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel... Aunt"
194,Phoebe,"Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?"
195,Ross,Alright.
196,Ross,I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
197,Rachel,Hi!
198,Ross,Hey.
199,Rachel,Guys!
200,Rachel,"Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!"
201,Chandler,"Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?"
202,Rachel,Noooo... the interview!
203,Rachel,She loved me!
204,Rachel,She absolutely loved me.
205,Rachel,"We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, andoh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect."
206,Rachel,I can do this.
207,Rachel,I can do this well!
208,Rachel,"Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story..."
209,Monica,"OK, great."
210,Monica,You'll tell us and we'll laugh.
211,Monica,Let's play poker.
212,Joey,"Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand."
213,Chandler,"Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?"
214,Monica,"Ha, ha, very funny, very funny."
215,Monica,But I think we'd like to give poker another try.
216,Monica,"Shall we, ladies?"
217,Monica,Phoebe and
218,Rachel,"Yes, we should."
219,Rachel,I think we should.
220,Ross,"Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?"
221,Rachel,"No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go."
222,Ross,Alright.
223,Rachel,Alright...  Commercial Break
224,Ross,"So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones."
225,Joey,"But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary."
226,Joey,"You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game."
227,Phoebe,"Alright, here's my $7.50."
228,Phoebe,But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
229,Joey,What?
230,Phoebe,"Oh, I cursed it."
231,Phoebe,So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
232,Chandler,"That's alright, I'll take it."
233,Chandler,Bad things happen to me anyway.
234,Chandler,This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
235,Ross,"Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen..."
236,Rachel,Mmm-hmmm.
237,Rachel,"Oh, so typical."
238,Rachel,"Ooo, I'm a man."
239,Rachel,"Ooo, I have a penis."
240,Rachel,"Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women."
241,Monica,You know what?
242,Monica,This is not over.
243,Monica,"We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever."
244,Rachel,Hmm.
245,Rachel,"Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon."
246,Ross,"So, you gals wanna hand over your money now?"
247,Ross,"That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing."
248,Rachel,"Ooooh, that's fine."
249,Rachel,"We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy."
250,Monica,"OK, we done with the chit-chat?"
251,Monica,Are we ready to play some serious poker?
252,Phoebe,"Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go."
253,Phoebe,"Right, OK, serious poker."
254,Monica,"Excuse me, where are you going?"
255,Ross,Uh... to the bathroom.
256,Monica,"Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?"
257,Ross,I want to go to the bathroom.
258,Joey,"Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza."
259,Rachel,"Oh no-no-no-no-no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then."
260,Joey,That's fine.
261,Joey,I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
262,Monica,"Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante."
263,Phoebe,Yes!
264,Phoebe,.... or no.
265,Ross,Alright.
266,Rachel,"Your fly is open, Geller."
267,Phoebe,"You guys, you know what I just realized?"
268,Phoebe,'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.'

283,Rachel,I won!
284,Rachel,I actually won!
285,Rachel,Oh my God!
286,Rachel,Y'know what?
287,Rachel,I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile.
288,Rachel,"I think that one was Ross's, and I thinkohthat one was Ross's."
289,Rachel,Yes!
290,Rachel,And your fly's still open...
291,Rachel,"Ha, I made you look...."
292,Rachel,I couldn't be inner.
293,Rachel,Monica?
294,Phoebe,"Monica, in or out?"
295,Monica,I hate this game!
296,Phoebe,"OK Joey, your bet."
297,Joey,"Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face."
298,Joey,"Oh, I'm out."
299,Phoebe,Ross?
300,Ross,"Oh, I am very in."
301,Phoebe,Chandler?
302,Chandler,Couldn't be more out.
303,Phoebe,Me too.
304,Phoebe,Rachel.
305,Rachel,"Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you."
306,Rachel,What do you say... want to waste another buck?
307,Ross,"No, not this time."
308,Ross,So... what'd you have?
309,Rachel,I'm not telling.
310,Ross,"Come on, show them to me."
311,Rachel,No..!
312,Ross,Show them to me!
313,Rachel,Get your hands out of there!
314,Rachel,No!

316,Ross,Show them!
317,Chandler,"Y'know, I've had dates like this."
318,Rachel,"Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you?"
319,Rachel,Your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple...
320,Phoebe,Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
321,Ross,"First of all, I'm not losing..."
322,Rachel,"Oh, you are losing."
323,Rachel,Definitely losing.
324,Ross,Let's not talk about losing.
325,Ross,Just deal the...
326,Rachel,"Hel-lo, Rachel Green."
327,Ross,"Mee mee, mee-mee mee."

341,Rachel,Yeah.......OK. Where were we?
342,Rachel,"Oh, OK... five card draw, uh... jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante."

344,Rachel,"Yes, we do."
345,Monica,"Alright, check."
346,Joey,Check.
347,Ross,I'm in for fifty cents.
348,Chandler,Call.
349,Phoebe,I'm in.
350,Rachel,I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars.
351,Ross,"I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit."
352,Rachel,"Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks."
353,Rachel,Does anybody have a problem with that?
354,Ross,"No, I fold."
355,Rachel,"What do you mean, you fold?"
356,Rachel,"Hey, come on!"
357,Rachel,What is this?
358,Rachel,"I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.'"
359,Rachel,"I mean, what, were you just full of it?"
360,Ross,I'm in.

25,Chandler,"But hey, it's courtside."
26,Chandler,The cheerleaders are going to be right    in fr.
27,Chandler,That's not the way to convince you.
28,Monica,"Chandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, ""You    can't go to the game."
29,Monica,"You have to spend time with me."""
30,Monica,"So, if you could just    realize it on your own ."
31,Chandler,I know.

35,Chandler,He's really looking forward to this.
36,Monica,Tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time.

69,Ross,"You know,    maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation."
70,Rachel,Oh that's so
71,Ross,I don't know.
72,Ross,"But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know."
73,Ross,He plays piano; I played keyboards in college.
74,Ross,He's been divorced; I have some    experience in that area.
75,Rachel,Yeah.
76,Phoebe,Hi
77,Rachel,Hey.
78,Phoebe,Oooh.
79,Phoebe,Girl's night out indeed.
80,Rachel,Ok.
81,Rachel,"So now, I think Emma is probably down for the night,    but if you need anything Ross ."
82,Ross,"Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right?"
83,Ross,You go have fun.
84,Rachel,Okay.
85,Rachel,You too.
86,Rachel,And I hope you score.
87,Rachel,Bye.
88,Ross,So .
89,Ross,Welcome.
90,Ross,I got bottled breast milk.
91,Ross,Okay.
92,Ross,"So, um, Phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano."
93,Ross,"You know, I, I used to, ah, play keyboards in college."
94,Ross,No.
95,Ross,Um .
96,Ross,ah .
97,Ross,"you know, I'm divorced."
98,Ross,"Um, Phoebe, ah ."
99,Ross,Phoebe    said you .
100,Ross,You've been divorced?
101,Ross,That's okay.
102,Ross,We'll talk about  something else.
103,Ross,Yeah.
104,Ross,Ah?
105,Ross,"Well, he and I would probably have    a lot to talk about."
106,Monica,Hi.
107,Chandler,Hey.
108,Monica,Welcome home.
109,Chandler,"Oh well, look at you."
110,Monica,Yeah.
111,Monica,What do you think?
112,Chandler,"Well, it looks great."
113,Chandler,It's just that .
114,Chandler,"well, I'm wearing the    same thing underneath."
115,Chandler,So .
116,Monica,Oh.
117,Chandler,See what I mean .
118,Joey,Hey!
119,Joey,How come the door's locked?
120,Monica,Just a second.
121,Chandler,"No, no, no, no, no."
122,Chandler,Joey can't know that I'm here.
123,Monica,Why not?
124,Chandler,Because I didn't know how to tell him that I couldn't go to the Knicks    game.
125,Chandler,"So, I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa."
126,Monica,"So, you lied to him?"
127,Chandler,Achhh.
128,Chandler,It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.
129,Chandler,Except with you.
130,Joey,Hey!
131,Joey,Open the door.
132,Joey,What's going on?
133,Joey,What are you .
134,Joey,..  Why are you dressed    like that?
135,Monica,"Oh, because, um ."
136,Monica,"well, Chandler's going to be home in a couple    of days."
137,Monica,"So, I thought I would, you know, practice the art of seduction."
138,Joey,"Oh, I thought I heard a man's voice before."
139,Monica,Oh I was just doing Chandler's side of the conversation.
140,Monica,"You know,    like, ""Hi, How do I look?"""
141,Monica,"""Really sexy."
142,Monica,"Could I BE any more    turned on?"""
143,Joey,Okay.
144,Joey,"Whoa, whoa."
145,Joey,Why are there two glasses of wine out?
146,Monica,Because.
147,Monica,one of them is for you.
148,Monica,Cheers.
149,Monica,"Okay, buh-bye."
150,Chandler,"You know, it's funny."
151,Chandler,"I've been, ah, practicing the art of seduction    myself."
152,Chandler,Hi ya.
153,Monica,You might want to keep practicing.
154,Chandler,Yah.
155,Chandler,It's Joey.
156,Chandler,Hey Joe.
157,Joey,"Dude, come home!"
158,Chandler,What?
159,Chandler,Why?
160,Joey,COME .
161,Joey,HOME.
162,Chandler,"Look I, I can't."
163,Chandler,What's going on?
164,Joey,"I don't know how to tell you this but, uh ."
165,Joey,I think Monica's cheatin'    on ya.
166,Joey,I told you shouldn't have married someone so much hotter than you.
167,Joey,All right look.
168,Joey,"If you can't come home and    deal with this, then I'm gonna."
169,Chandler,NO!
170,Joey,I just heard him!
171,Chandler,Can you .
172,Chandler,hear him .
173,Chandler,now?
174,Joey,No.
175,Joey,"All right, I'm going in."
176,Chandler,No!
177,Chandler,Wait!
178,Joey,I heard him again!
179,Chandler,"All right, look."
180,Chandler,Just stay there.
181,Chandler,I'm    coming home.
182,Joey,Okay.
183,Joey,Great.
184,Joey,I'll see you when you get here.
185,Joey,I'm gonna wait out in    the hall in case the dude comes out.
186,Chandler,Is that really necessary?
187,Joey,Absolutely.
188,Joey,You'd do it for me.
189,Joey,Not that you ever have to because I    know how to keep my women satisfied.
190,Ross,Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?
191,Ross,"I mean, they said thirty minutes    or less."
192,Ross,"Well, how long has it been?"
193,Ross,I do.
194,Ross,I do.
195,Ross,"Although, it's actually a lager."
196,Ross,I don't know.
197,Ross,We could look it up.
198,Phoebe,Oh God.
199,Phoebe,Remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around    talking about you and Ross?
200,Rachel,Oh God.
201,Rachel,It seems like forever ago.
202,Phoebe,I know.
203,Phoebe,"So, what's going on with you and Ross?"
204,Rachel,"Well, um ."
205,Rachel,I don't know.
206,Rachel,"I mean, for a long time nothing."
207,Rachel,"But    you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a ."
208,Rachel,ah    .
209,Rachel,little thing.
210,Phoebe,Oh my God!
211,Phoebe,I love things.
212,Phoebe,What happened?
213,Rachel,"Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked."
214,Rachel,"And, ah, then we    had a little ."
215,Rachel,um .
216,Rachel,eye-contact.
217,Phoebe,Eye-contact?
218,Rachel,Mm-hmm.
219,Phoebe,I hope you were using protection.
220,Rachel,Oh.
221,Rachel,Should we send them something back?
222,Phoebe,Oooh.
223,Phoebe,Let's do.
224,Phoebe,Let's send them mashed potatoes.
225,Rachel,No!
226,Rachel,Wait!
227,Rachel,"No, no."
228,Rachel,Don't do that!
229,Rachel,That's going to make them think    they can come over here.
230,Phoebe,So?
231,Phoebe,What if they do?
232,Rachel,"Well, we're not here to meet guys."
233,Rachel,"You have a boyfriend, I have a    b. ."
234,Rachel,baby and a Ross.
235,Phoebe,"Yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen."
236,Phoebe,We're just having fun.
237,Phoebe,"You know, not everything had to go as far as ""eye-contact."""
238,Monica,"Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa."
239,Chandler,"Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating    on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him?"
240,Chandler,I heard it.
241,Monica,I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.
242,Chandler,All right.
243,Chandler,I've got a plan.
244,Chandler,I'll go down the fire escape.
245,Monica,"Yes, because all good plans start with, ""I'll go down the fire escape."""
246,Chandler,Hear me out woman.
247,Chandler,I'll go down the fire escape.
248,Chandler,"Then, I'll wait    for a while."
249,Chandler,"Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got    back from Tulsa."
250,Chandler,"Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy    in here."
251,Monica,Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out?
252,Monica,I heard it.
253,Chandler,I'm just going to wait for a little while.
254,Monica,Scary pigeon's back?
255,Chandler,It's huge.
256,Rachel,Oh my God.
257,Rachel,I can't believe you live in that building.
258,Rachel,My grandmother    lives in that building.
259,Rachel,Ida Green?
260,Rachel,No sense of personal space?
261,Rachel,Kind of smells    like chicken?
262,Rachel,Looks like a potato.
263,Rachel,That's my bubby!
264,Phoebe,Yeah.
265,Phoebe,I'm sorry.
266,Phoebe,We weren't really looking for anything to happen    with you guys.
267,Phoebe,"I, I have a boyfriend."
268,Rachel,"Oh, well, it's complicated."
269,Rachel,I don't actually have a boyfriend.
270,Rachel,But    um.
271,Rachel,"I'm sorry, no."
272,Rachel,Oh sure.
273,Phoebe,"Oh my God, you're giving your real number."
274,Rachel,Great.
275,Phoebe,Bye.
276,Phoebe,Wow.
277,Phoebe,"So, that's great."
278,Phoebe,"You, Bill, Ross, and Emma    are going to be so happy together."
279,Phoebe,What were you thinking?
280,Rachel,I don't know.
281,Rachel,"He was cute, and he liked me."
282,Rachel,It was an impulse.
283,Phoebe,What about Ross?
284,Phoebe,What about your moment?
285,Phoebe,Don't you want to talk to    Ross about it?
286,Rachel,No.
287,Rachel,"No, because I know exactly how the conversation's gonna go."
288,Rachel,"""Hey    Ross, you know, I think we had a moment before."""
289,Rachel,"""Yeah."""
290,Rachel,"""Me too."""
291,Rachel,"""Well, but I'm not sure I really want to do anything about    it."""
292,Rachel,"""Yeah."""
293,Rachel,"""Me neither."""
294,Rachel,"""Well, should we just continue to live together and not    really tell each other how we're really feeling?"""
295,Rachel,"""Yeah."
296,Rachel,"That works for me."""
297,Phoebe,"Yeah, I see what you mean."
298,Phoebe,"By the way, nice Ross imitation."
299,Rachel,"Oh, thanks."
300,Phoebe,"But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough."
301,Rachel,Wha.
302,Rachel,hey!
303,Phoebe,Better!
304,Rachel,"Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments    with Ross, you know?"
305,Rachel,I should just .
306,Rachel,move on with my life.
307,Phoebe,Really?
308,Phoebe,You're moving on from Ross?
309,Rachel,I don't know.
310,Rachel,Do I have to decide right now?
311,Phoebe,"Well, you kind of just did."
312,Phoebe,That guy is going to call you tonight.
313,Phoebe,Ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message.
314,Rachel,"Oh God, Ross."
315,Rachel,Ross is going to pick up the phone.
316,Rachel,"Oh, I have to get    my number back."
317,Rachel,Oh my God.
318,Rachel,He's gone.
319,Phoebe,"""Oh, I have to get my number back."
320,Phoebe,Oh my God.
321,Phoebe,"He's gone."""
322,Phoebe,Dead on.
323,Ross,So soon?
324,Ross,Okay.
325,Ross,"Well, thanks, ah, thanks for the beer."
326,Ross,Ah yeah.
327,Ross,Good times.
328,Phoebe,"Hey, Mike, it's me."
329,Phoebe,"Listen,    is um, is Ross near you?"
330,Phoebe,"Well, you have to go back in."
331,Phoebe,"I'm so sorry honey, but, okay, Rachel gave this guy her number and,    um, she doesn't want Ross to answer the phone."
332,Phoebe,"So, you have to intercept all    his calls."
333,Phoebe,He says he can't do that.
334,Rachel,"Oh give me , , ,  Hi, Mike?"
335,Rachel,Hi.
336,Rachel,Listen.
337,Rachel,"I know this is a lot to ask, but you know what?"
338,Rachel,If you do this I .
339,Rachel,Phoebe will .
340,Rachel,do anything you want.
341,Rachel,"Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff."
342,Phoebe,All right.
343,Phoebe,Hello?
344,Phoebe,Hi.
345,Phoebe,"I'm sorry    about her, but she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff."
346,Phoebe,"Oh, Mike."
347,Phoebe,Bye.
348,Ross,"Uh, hi."
349,Ross,Why?
350,Ross,But you left.
351,Joey,Wow!
352,Joey,That didn't take long.
353,Joey,"I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three    hour flight."
354,Chandler,"Well, you're forgetting about the time difference."
355,Monica,Chandler!
356,Monica,You're home!
357,Chandler,That's right.
358,Chandler,You're husband's home.
359,Chandler,"So, now the sex can stop."
360,Monica,What are you saying?
361,Chandler,Joey said that you're in here with another man.
362,Monica,There's no man in here.
363,Monica,How dare you accuse me of that.
364,Joey,All right.
365,Joey,All right.
366,Joey,"Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend    take a look around, huh?"
367,Joey,Bwa-ah-ah!
368,Chandler,What is he doing?
369,Monica,I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.
370,Joey,"Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows."
371,Chandler,All right.
372,Chandler,"Well, I'll check the guest room."
373,Joey,Why do I smell men's cologne?
374,Monica,I think that's you.
375,Joey,Oh yeah.
376,Joey,I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
377,Chandler,There's nobody here Joe.
378,Joey,I guess not.
379,Monica,I can't believe you thought I was cheating.
380,Monica,You    own me an apology.
381,Joey,"Yeah, right Monica."
382,Joey,I'm so sorry.
383,Monica,"Ah, it's an honest mistake."
384,Monica,It could    happen to anyone.
385,Monica,"All right, see ya."
386,Joey,"Whoa,    whoa."
387,Joey,Wait a minute.
388,Joey,Wait a minute.
389,Joey,"If you just got back from Tulsa, how    did your suitcase beat you here?"
390,Chandler,I climb down the fire escape and you    can't put that in the closet?
391,Ross,"Maybe you should look up ""fascinating."""
392,Ross,I don't understand what just happened    here.
393,Joey,What's going on?
394,Chandler,I'm sorry.
395,Chandler,"I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend    the night with Monica and I, I didn't know ."
396,Chandler,I didn't think you'd understand.
397,Joey,What?
398,Joey,You think I'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be    with his wife?
399,Joey,Huh?
400,Joey,"Do you think I'm like, ""Duh."""
401,Monica,Joey?
402,Joey,Yeah?
403,Monica,I don't know what to say.
404,Monica,We shouldn't have lied to you.
405,Chandler,Yeah.
406,Chandler,I feel so bad.
407,Chandler,Is there anything I can do to make it up to    you?
408,Joey,"Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know    you said you couldn't."
409,Joey,But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a    bump on the head.
410,Chandler,I'm sorry.
411,Chandler,That's the one thing I can't do.
412,Chandler,I promised I'd be with    Monica.
413,Joey,All right.
414,Monica,You can go.
415,Chandler,What?
416,Monica,You should go to the game.
417,Monica,It's okay.
418,Monica,I want you to.
419,Chandler,Really?
420,Chandler,You're gonna be okay?
421,Monica,"Yeah, I'll be fine."
422,Monica,"You know, maybe I'll stay here and practice the    art of seduction."
423,Chandler,"You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?"
424,Monica,It's gonna be so hot!
425,Chandler,"Okay, bye."
426,Monica,Have fun.
427,Joey,Thanks.
428,Joey,Here's your ticket.
429,Chandler,"Hey, listen."
430,Chandler,"I'm never going to lie to you again, okay?"
431,Chandler,And I want    you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid.
432,Joey,Thanks man.
433,Joey,Where are you going?
434,Chandler,Game's tomorrow night Joe.
435,Rachel,Hi.
436,Ross,Oh God.
437,Rachel,Oh .
438,Phoebe,Oh.
439,Rachel,Wow.
440,Rachel,"So, what did you guys do?"
441,Ross,"Oh, you know ."
442,Ross,we just drank some beer and Mike played with the boundaries    of normal social conduct.
443,Phoebe,"Well, good bye."
444,Rachel,That was fun Pheebs.
445,Phoebe,I know.
446,Phoebe,That was fun.
447,Rachel,See you guys.
448,Ross,"Rachel, lock the door."
449,Ross,"Lock the door, seriously."
450,Rachel,Oh shoot.
451,Rachel,I forgot to pay Phoebe for the drinks.
452,Rachel,"Wait, wait."
453,Rachel,Sorry.
454,Rachel,Did he call?
455,Rachel,Did that guy call?
456,Rachel,"Oh, around"

461,Ross,Can I take a message?
462,Ross,Bill from the bar?
463,Ross,"Okay, ""Bill from the bar."""
464,Ross,I'll make sure she gets your number.
465,Rachel,Aaah.
466,Ross,"So, ah ."
467,Ross,"So, how was it?"
468,Ross,"Uh, did you guys."
469,Ross,Did you guys have    a good time?
470,Rachel,"Oh, it was so much fun."
471,Rachel,It felt so good to be out.
472,Ross,"Uh, Rach."

474,Ross,Never    mind.
475,Ross,[Tag

478,Phoebe,I'll be right back.
479,Phoebe,I've got to go to the bathroom.

1,Joey,We could call it Chuck.
2,Chandler,Or... Dick.
3,Ross,Hey.
4,Ross,Chandler and
5,Joey,Hey.
6,Ross,"Listen, I-I need a favor."
7,Ross,"Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something."
8,Chandler,Was it like a sneeze only better?
9,Ross,"No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body."
10,Joey,What was it?
11,Ross,"Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not..."
12,Ross,"It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out."
13,Ross,Chandler and
14,Joey,Whoa!!
15,Chandler,No!
16,Ross,"Come on you guys, it's no big deal!"
17,Chandler,Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!!
18,Chandler,Huh.
19,Ross,Well what is it?
20,Ross,Is it a mole?
21,Joey,"No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole."
22,Ross,"Well, eww."
23,Ross,What?
24,Ross,Is it a pimple?
25,Chandler,"No, it's... fancier than a pimple."
26,Chandler,"Look Ross, why don't you just go see a"
27,Rachel,Hey guys!
28,Rachel,What's...
29,Chandler,"Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter."

31,Joey,"Yeah, right."
32,Joey,Opening Credits
33,Phoebe,"Okay, and then this is the coffee house."
34,Phoebe,This is where I play my music.
35,Phoebe,"Yeah, and these are my friends."
36,Phoebe,People.
37,Phoebe,"This is Vince, Vince the people."
38,Rachel,Hi!
39,Chandler,Hey!
40,Phoebe,Vince is a fireman.
41,Rachel,Wow!
42,Rachel,Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
43,Chandler,"Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred."
44,Chandler,"You're right, I know."
45,Phoebe,Okay.
46,Rachel,"Wow, he's cute, Pheebs!"
47,Rachel,But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.
48,Phoebe,"Oh, Jason?"
49,Phoebe,"Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight."
50,Rachel,What-Pheebs?!
51,Rachel,Two dates in one day?
52,Rachel,That's so unlike you.
53,Phoebe,"I know, I know!"
54,Phoebe,I'm like playing the field.
55,Phoebe,Y'know?
56,Phoebe,"Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats."
57,Phoebe,Y'know?
58,Phoebe,"Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler."
59,Joey,"So Pheebs, do they know about each other?"
60,Phoebe,Does a dog's lips move when he reads?
61,Phoebe,"Okay, no they don't."
62,Ross,Hey guys!
63,Joey,Hey.
64,Rachel,Hi!
65,Joey,Well?
66,Chandler,"Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?"
67,Ross,"Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign."
68,Joey,Well what is it?
69,Ross,He couldn't even tell me!
70,Ross,He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality.
71,Ross,"And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it."
72,Chandler,Y'know what?
73,Chandler,"You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple."
74,Chandler,He just lopped it right off.
75,Chandler,Y'know?
76,Chandler,So I guess I'm lucky.
77,Chandler,I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
78,Ross,At least they knew what yours was.
79,Ross,"Y'know, yours had a name."
80,Joey,Oh!
81,Joey,Maybe they'll name yours after you!
82,Joey,"Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross."
83,Joey,"And then people would be like, ""Awww, he's got a Ross."""
84,Ross,"Yeah, that'd be cool!"
85,Monica,Pete's breaking up with me.
86,Monica,"I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk."
87,Rachel,And?
88,Monica,Well that's it.
89,Monica,People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.
90,Joey,"Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you."
91,Monica,Really?
92,Joey,"Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you."
93,Phoebe,That is so great!
94,Phoebe,"Oh, I...  Oh my God!"
95,Phoebe,Oh my God!!
96,Phoebe,No!
97,Phoebe,No!
98,Phoebe,"Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic."
99,Phoebe,"Oh my God, here they come!"
100,Phoebe,"Well, we gotta get out of here!"
101,Phoebe,"Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one."
102,Phoebe,Okay?
103,Ross,"Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple."
104,Ross,Y'know?
105,Ross,Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple.
106,Ross,Y'know?
107,Ross,You can take it off.
108,Ross,Just slice that baby right off!
109,Ross,Dr.

113,Ross,Dr.
114,Ross,"Well then, what is it?!"
115,Ross,Dr.
116,Monica,I gotta go water Pete's plants.
117,Monica,"Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants."
118,Chandler,"Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants."
119,Chandler,If y'know what I mean.
120,Joey,"Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them."
121,Phoebe,and I-I can't take it!
122,Phoebe,Y'know?
123,Phoebe,"I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one."
124,Phoebe,It's making me crazy.
125,Rachel,"Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?"
126,Phoebe,Uh.
127,Joey,Whoa-whoa-whoa.
128,Joey,"What ah, what happened to playing the field?"
129,Phoebe,"Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work."
130,Phoebe,It's like I'm working in the field.
131,Rachel,"So Pheebs, pick one of them."
132,Monica,Yeah.
133,Monica,Which one do you like more?

137,Joey,"Okay, good, so there you go."
138,Joey,Go with Vince.
139,Phoebe,"Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive."
140,Chandler,"Well sensitive is important, pick him."
141,Phoebe,Yeah.
142,Joey,"Oh sure, go with the sissy."

144,Joey,"Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler."

201,Rachel,You-you could have like little money place settings.
202,Rachel,"And ah, you could start with a money salad!"
203,Rachel,"I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it."
204,Monica,Would you stop?
205,Monica,"We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose."
206,Chandler,"Yes, but this is Pete."
207,Chandler,Okay?
208,Chandler,"He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome."
209,Chandler,For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
210,Monica,"Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy."
211,Ross,Monica's right.
212,Ross,We're talking about getting married here.
213,Ross,Okay?

219,Phoebe,I have break up with Vince.
220,Chandler,"Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh?"
221,Phoebe,"Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know?"
222,Phoebe,"But, it's just Jason's so sensitive, y'know?"
223,Phoebe,"And in the long run, I think sensitive it's just better than having just like a really, really, really nice  butt."
224,Phoebe,Jason!
225,Phoebe,Definitely Jason!
226,Phoebe,"Okay, wish me luck!"
227,Rachel,OH MY GOD!!!
228,Rachel,"Sorry, I was just imagining what it'd be like to catch the money bouquet."
229,Phoebe,Excuse me.
230,Phoebe,"Umm, is Vince here?"
231,Phoebe,Wow!
232,Phoebe,I didn't know you guys actually used those.
233,Phoebe,"Umm, wow."
234,Phoebe,This-this isn't gonna be easy.
235,Phoebe,"Umm, I don't think we should see each other anymore."
236,Phoebe,I'm sorry.
237,Phoebe,"Oh my God, I didn't"
238,Phoebe,Wait-wait-wait!
239,Phoebe,Wait!
240,Phoebe,"I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy."
241,Ross,"Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs."
242,Ross,I don't want to make it savory.
243,Monica,"Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it."
244,Ross,Gimme this.
245,Rachel,Hi!
246,Rachel,"Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist."
247,Monica,Brides magazines?
248,Rachel,"Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin."
249,Phoebe,"Oh, you so would!"
250,Phoebe,"Oh, you should get that anyway."
251,Phoebe,Like for clubbing.
252,Monica,"It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes."
253,Monica,"I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't."
254,Monica,Right?
255,Monica,"I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy."
256,Rachel,Oh my God.
257,Monica,I know.
258,Monica,I need more pie.
259,Phoebe,"Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?"
260,Rachel,You didn't break up with that fireman?
261,Phoebe,"No, that was my way of telling you."
262,Phoebe,"Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints."
263,Phoebe,He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
264,Rachel,Wow!
265,Phoebe,"Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal."
266,Monica,"So then, are you going to dump Jason?"
267,Phoebe,"Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and Okay so Jason is sensitive,  but now so's Vince  Plus, Vince has the body y'know?"
268,Phoebe,So It's really just about the math.
269,Phoebe,Jason?
270,Phoebe,Nah-ha!
271,Ross,Hi.
272,Ross,Guru
273,Ross,"Listen, I got to tell you I've-I've never been to a guru before, so... Guru"

304,Monica,My parents will be so happy.
305,Phoebe,"Crazy underwear, creepin' up my butt."
306,Phoebe,"Crazy underwear, always in a rut."
307,Phoebe,Crazy under--wear  Oh No!

317,Phoebe,"Yeah, okay, I've-I've been dating both of you, and it's been really horrible."
318,Phoebe,"Cause y'know it's been a lot of fun, for me."
319,Phoebe,"Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn't know how to chose, so..."
320,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm terrible, I'm a terrible person."
321,Phoebe,I'm terrible.
322,Phoebe,Really?
323,Phoebe,"Well, this is none of my business."
324,Phoebe,"Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park."
325,Phoebe,"Well, that could've been really awkward."
326,Phoebe,"Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I'm gonna do that for you."

113,Chandler,Hi sweetie.
114,Chandler,"So, what was with all the whispering?"
115,Monica,I can't tell you.
116,Monica,It's a secret.
117,Chandler,Secret?
118,Chandler,Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another.
119,Chandler,We have too much love and respect for one another.
120,Monica,Awww.
121,Monica,But still no.
122,Chandler,"No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything."
123,Chandler,I do not have any secrets from you.
124,Monica,Really?
125,Monica,"Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?"
126,Chandler,"Oh no-no, I can't do that."
127,Monica,"If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said."
128,Chandler,Okay.
129,Monica,Okay.
130,Chandler,"So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos."
131,Chandler,"And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car."
132,Chandler,So Ross has about 10 tacos.
133,Chandler,"And anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy."
134,Monica,Oh my God.
135,Monica,He threw up?
136,Chandler,"No, he visited a little town south of throw up."
137,Chandler,So what was Phoebe's secret?

143,Monica,Please still marry me.
144,Rachel,"Chandler, you have an assistant right?"
145,Chandler,Did she call?
146,Chandler,You-you told her I was sick right?
147,Chandler,Always tell her I am sick!
148,Rachel,"No, I-I just don't know how you decide who to hire."
149,Rachel,I mean I've got it narrowed down to two people.
150,Rachel,One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there's this guy
151,Chandler,What about him?
152,Rachel,I love him.
153,Rachel,He's so pretty I wanna cry!

156,Phoebe,Come on you know what to do!
157,Phoebe,You hire the first one!
158,Phoebe,"You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified."
159,Rachel,Uh-huh.
160,Rachel,"No, I hear what you're saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing?"
161,Rachel,Look how pretty!

163,Phoebe,Oh my God!
164,Phoebe,Oh But no!

223,Monica,Ross!
224,Ross,"Oh, nothin' much."
225,Ross,Just trying to figure out what I'm gonna do for dinner.
226,Chandler,Huh.
227,Ross,HeyOoh!
228,Ross,"What's-what's that, dinner stuff?"
229,Ross,You making dinner?
230,Chandler,No!
231,Chandler,Shhh!
232,Ross,What you got over there?
233,Ross,Tacos?
234,Monica,No!
235,Monica,No.
236,Monica,They're umm They're just uhground beef smileys.
237,Ross,"Uhh, those are tacos."
238,Monica,Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
239,Ross,"Eh, either way I'll pass."
240,Ross,I still can't eat those.
241,Ross,What's so funny?
242,Monica,I'm not laughing.
243,Ross,You told her!
244,Chandler,Nancy Thompson's getting fired!
245,Ross,"Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning!"
246,Ross,It's not like I choose to do it!
247,Ross,"It's not likeIt's not like I said, ""Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"""
248,Monica,You're right.
249,Monica,I mean I'm sorry.
250,Monica,"Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing."
251,Monica,I should be laying down papers for you!
252,Ross,How could you tell her?
253,Chandler,I had too okay?!
254,Chandler,We're getting married!
255,Chandler,Married couples can't keep secrets from one another!
256,Ross,Oh really?
257,Ross,Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
258,Chandler,Du-ude!
259,Monica,What happened in Atlantic City?
260,Ross,"Well, Chandler and I are in a bar"
261,Chandler,"Did you not hear me say, ""Du-ude?!"""
262,Ross,"And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay?"
263,Ross,"So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing."
264,Ross,"Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out withgirls."
265,Monica,You kissed a guy?!!
266,Monica,Oh my God.
267,Chandler,"In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy."
268,Ross,"Oh Mon, I laughed so hard"
269,Chandler,"Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?"
270,Ross,"Whatever dude, you kissed a guy."
271,Ross,Commercial Break
272,Rachel,Hi!
273,Joey,Hey.
274,Phoebe,"HeyOoh, how's Hilda?"
275,Phoebe,Is she working out?
276,Rachel,"Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes."
277,Joey,Was she happy you gave her the job?
278,Rachel,"Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant."
279,Joey,Hello?
280,Joey,Oh hey!
281,Joey,"Can you, can you hang on a second?"
282,Joey,It's the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
283,Joey,can you excuse me for a minute?
284,Joey,"Hey, funny you should call."
285,Joey,I was just looking over next week's script.
286,Joey,Canceled?!
287,Joey,Like they're taking it off the air?
288,Joey,Ohh.
289,Joey,"All right, see you Monday."
290,Joey,We're not even shootin' them anymore?!!
291,Joey,"All right, bye!"
292,Joey,They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
293,Phoebe,Sorry.
294,Rachel,I'm sorry Joey.
295,Joey,Why would they do that?!
296,Joey,It was a good show right?
297,Chandler,You wanna tell secrets?!
298,Chandler,Okay!
299,Chandler,Okay!
300,Chandler,"In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!"
301,Ross,All right!
302,Ross,All right!
303,Ross,Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
304,Chandler,Ross came in forth and cried!
305,Monica,Oh my God!
306,Ross,"Oh, is that funny?!"
307,Ross,"Oh, you-you find that funny?!"
308,Ross,Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!
309,Monica,I-I already told him everything!
310,Monica,You shush!
311,Ross,"Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she'd made."
312,Monica,Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!
313,Ross,Monica couldn't tell time til she was 13!
314,Monica,It's hard for some people!
315,Chandler,Of course it is.
316,Chandler,Wowwhoa!
317,Monica,Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
318,Chandler,Hey!!
319,Monica,"Ohh, I'm sorry I couldn't think of anymore for Ross!"
320,Ross,Ohh!
321,Ross,Ohh!
322,Ross,"In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!"
323,Chandler,That was you!
324,Ross,"Whatever dude, you kissed a guy."
325,Joey,How could this happen to me?!
326,Joey,Yesterday I had two TV shows!
327,Joey,"Today, I got nothin'!"
328,Rachel,"Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?"
329,Joey,"Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there."
330,Phoebe,What happened?
331,Joey,Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
332,Rachel,"Joey, why would you do that?"
333,Joey,Because they wanted me to audition!
334,Phoebe,You!
335,Phoebe,An actor?!
336,Phoebe,That's madness!
337,Rachel,Tag?
338,Rachel,"Hi, who was that?"
339,Rachel,Really?
340,Phoebe,Hi!
341,Phoebe,You must be Hilda.
342,Rachel,"Yeah, this is Tag."
343,Rachel,"Tag, this is Phoebe."
344,Rachel,"Phoebe, can I see you for a second?"
345,Phoebe,"Oh, you like that?"
346,Phoebe,You should hear my phone number.
347,Rachel,Okay.
348,Rachel,We'll be right back.
349,Phoebe,So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?
350,Rachel,"All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I'm telling you"
351,Phoebe,But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
352,Rachel,"Yes, I know that."
353,Rachel,I know that.
354,Rachel,And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I've ever done.
355,Rachel,"But I'm telling you, from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional."
356,Rachel,Yes?
357,Rachel,.)
358,Rachel,Hi!
359,Rachel,Gay?
360,Rachel,Yeah.
361,Joey,Hey!
362,Joey,Terry.
363,Joey,Wait!
364,Joey,Terry!
365,Joey,"WaitLookWait I-I Look, I'm really sorry about before."
366,Joey,I was an idiot thinking I'm too big to audition for you.
367,Joey,You gotta give me another chance.
368,Joey,Wait!
369,Joey,Terry!
370,Joey,Please!
371,Joey,"Look, I just lost my other job."
372,Joey,Okay?
373,Joey,You have no idea how much I need this.
374,Joey,"Please, help me out, for old times sake."
375,Joey,Nurse #1
376,Joey,I'm back baby!
377,Joey,Ha-ha-ha!
378,Monica,"Y'know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue."
379,Ross,"And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!"
380,Chandler,You have no trouble telling time now right?
381,Monica,No!
382,Chandler,Quick!
383,Chandler,What time is it?
384,Monica,I don't know!
385,Monica,Time to kiss a guy maybe?!
386,Monica,What are you laughing at Pampers?
387,Chandler,Y'know when I said that because we're getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
388,Monica,Yeah?
389,Chandler,Yeah that was stupid.
390,Chandler,Let's not do that.
391,Monica,"Ohh, absolutely."
392,Ross,And!
393,Ross,"We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else."
394,Monica,"Yeah, definitely!"
395,Ross,"Okay,  if you'll excuse me, I-I'm gonna go hang out with some people who don't know the Space Mountain story."
396,Monica,"Then, I'd steer clear of Phoebe."
397,Ross,Man!
398,Chandler,"Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn't hang out withall the guys in my office."
399,Chandler,Ending Credits
400,Rachel,Hi!
401,Rachel,"Well yeah, sure, what's up?"
402,Rachel,Oh really?
403,Rachel,"Oh, did you not want people to know that?"
404,Rachel,Why's that?
405,Rachel,"Ohh, you can say."
406,Rachel,"Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things."
407,Rachel,Kay.
408,Rachel,Yeah.
409,Rachel,"Yeah, she's gay."
410,Rachel,End
0,Ross,Ok.
1,Ross,"Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him."
2,Ross,Hi!
3,Ross,"Oh, great."
4,Ross,Great.
5,Ross,"There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it."
6,Ross,Ok.
7,Ross,"Oh, you and me?"
8,Ross,Ok.
9,Ross,"As in, ""I now pronounce you wife and wife"" married?"
10,Ross,Why wouldn't I want to come?
11,Ross,I had fun at the first wedding.
12,Ross,"No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you?"
13,Ross,What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy?
14,Ross,"I'm revelling baby, believe me!"
15,Ross,Mmm hmmm.
16,Ross,Uh-huh.
17,Ross,This is so cool.
18,Ross,You're actually gonna be on television.
19,Joey,It really hit me last night.
20,Joey,I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives.
21,Joey,"And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives.."
22,Monica,Yes!
23,Monica,"Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast."
24,Monica,"ROSS, CHANDLER &"
25,Joey,Yes!
26,Monica,"They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?"
27,Ross,Would it matter?
28,Monica,"Oh, you are so great!"
29,Monica,Thank you!
30,Joey,Are you really not going?
31,Ross,I am really not going.
32,Ross,I don't get it.
33,Ross,"They already live together, why do they need to get married?"
34,Monica,"They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them."
35,Ross,If you wanna call that a reason.
36,Chandler,"Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room?"
37,Chandler,"Hi, neighbor."
38,Monica,"Ross, I thought you were over this."
39,Ross,"Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok?"
40,Ross,She's my ex-wife.
41,Ross,"If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there."
42,Joey,"Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever."
43,Rachel,Did I miss it?
44,Rachel,Did I miss it?
45,Joey,"No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself."
46,Chandler,"Whoa, she's pretty."
47,Joey,"Yeah, and she's really nice too."
48,Joey,"She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting."
49,Rachel,"I'm sorry, what?"
50,Monica,What?
51,Joey,"It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one."
52,Joey,"So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this."
53,Chandler,"Oh, ok."
54,Joey,"There's my scene, there's my scene."
55,Joey,"""Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon."
56,Joey,MRS.
57,Joey,I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected.
58,Joey,Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma.
59,Joey,Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
60,Chandler,Nice!
61,Rachel,That's great!
62,Ross,Excellent!
63,Chandler,For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
64,Ross,That is so good!
65,Ross,Do it again!
66,Joey,"All right, all right."
67,Joey,"""Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"""
68,Chandler,That's great.
69,Chandler,"All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect."
70,Ross,"No no, that's me."
71,Chandler,"Oh, yeah."
72,Ross,"Oh, hello."
73,Phoebe,"Oh, thanks."
74,Phoebe,I couldn't uh...
75,Ross,Is everything ok?
76,Phoebe,"Um, no, huh-uh."
77,Phoebe,One of my clients died on the massage table today.
78,Ross,Oh my god.
79,Chandler,That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
80,Phoebe,"Yeah, um, she was 82 years old."
81,Phoebe,"Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman."
82,Monica,"Oh, honey."
83,Phoebe,"Yeah, it's just so strange."
84,Phoebe,"I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, ""ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage."""
85,Phoebe,"Little did she know God was thinking, ""Ok, but that's it."""
86,Phoebe,"Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far."
87,Rachel,What do you mean?
88,Phoebe,I think it went into me.
89,Monica,"God, this is so hard."
90,Monica,I can't decide between lamb or duck.
91,Chandler,"Well, of course, lambs are scarier."
92,Chandler,Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.
93,Rachel,"Ok, who ordered what?"
94,Ross,"Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim."
95,Chandler,"Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?"
96,Rachel,Oh god.
97,Joey,I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
98,Rachel,"I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?"
99,Phoebe,Talk about crap.
100,Phoebe,Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
101,Joey,"Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?"
102,Phoebe,I don't know.
103,Phoebe,"I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business."
104,Phoebe,Sit up!
105,Phoebe,MRS.
106,Rachel,Mom!
107,Rachel,MRS
108,Rachel,Pretty much.
109,Rachel,MRS
110,Rachel,"This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross."
111,Rachel,MRS
112,Ross,"Hi, Mrs. Green."
113,Ross,MRS
114,Rachel,Oh Mom!
115,Rachel,MRS
116,Chandler,"Believe me, sometimes that happens."
117,Chandler,MRS
118,Rachel,Really?
119,Rachel,MRS
120,Phoebe,I know who it is you remind me of.
121,Phoebe,Evelyn Dermer.
122,Phoebe,"'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift."
123,Phoebe,Now she looks like Soupy Sales.
124,Joey,"Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?"
125,Phoebe,I don't know.
126,Phoebe,Who's Soupy Sales?
127,Phoebe,[at Rachel and Monica's MRS
128,Rachel,"Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument."
129,Rachel,MRS
130,Rachel,I know.
131,Rachel,"And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?"
132,Rachel,MRS
133,Rachel,For...me.
134,Rachel,MRS
135,Rachel,"Well, what do you mean?"
136,Rachel,MRS
137,Monica,All right.
138,Monica,Tell me if this is too cute.
139,Monica,"Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts."
140,Rachel,Oh god.
141,Rachel,I think I'm gonna be sick.
142,Monica,Why?
143,Monica,It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
144,Ross,And you had no idea they weren't getting along?
145,Rachel,None.
146,Joey,They didn't fight a lot?
147,Rachel,No!
148,Rachel,They didn't even talk to each other.
149,Rachel,"God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?"
150,Phoebe,"In my day, divorce was not an option."
151,Joey,"Hey, look who's up."
152,Rachel,I just can't believe this is happening.
153,Rachel,"I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced."
154,Rachel,I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.
155,Monica,Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering?
156,Monica,"I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you."
157,Rachel,"Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?"
158,Chandler,"You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves."
159,Chandler,But in your case it's actually kinda true.
160,Phoebe,That's him.
161,Chandler,Damn.
162,Chandler,My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
163,Chandler,MR
164,Phoebe,"Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman."
165,Phoebe,Thanks for meeting me.
166,Phoebe,MR
167,Phoebe,"Um, do you wanna sit?"
168,Phoebe,MR
169,Phoebe,"I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me."
170,Phoebe,MR
171,Phoebe,Yeah.
172,Phoebe,"Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?"
173,Phoebe,MR
174,Phoebe,Everything?
175,Phoebe,MR
176,Phoebe,"Whoa, that's a lot of stuff."
177,Phoebe,MR
178,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head."
179,Phoebe,MR
180,Rachel,These are from Halloween three years ago.
181,Rachel,MRS
182,Rachel,"No, that was his costume."
183,Rachel,"See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist."
184,Monica,"Um, you guys, you know when I said before, ""thank you, but I don't really need your help""?"
185,Rachel,"Actually, what I think you said was, ""don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."""
186,Monica,Really?
187,Monica,Weird.
188,Monica,"Anyway, see, I planned everything really well."
189,Monica,I planned and I planned and I planned.
190,Monica,"It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it."
191,Rachel,"Hey, Mon, you want some help?"
192,Monica,If you want.
193,Phoebe,Hey.
194,Phoebe,What a day.
195,Phoebe,I took her everywhere.
196,Phoebe,"The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty."
197,Rachel,She's still with you?
198,Phoebe,Yeah.
199,Phoebe,I guess she hasn't seen everything yet.
200,Phoebe,"I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again."
201,Phoebe,"Oh, such a pretty face."
202,Phoebe,MRS
203,Rachel,God!
204,Monica,"All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food."
205,Monica,MRS
206,Rachel,Oh!
207,Rachel,What's new in sex?
208,Rachel,MRS
209,Monica,"I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything."
210,Monica,MRS
211,Rachel,"Oh, I'm sorry."
212,Rachel,You know what?
213,Rachel,I cannot have this conversation with you.
214,Rachel,"I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy."
215,Rachel,What?
216,Rachel,What do you want?
217,Rachel,Do you want my blessing?
218,Rachel,MRS
219,Rachel,You want me to talk you out of it?
220,Rachel,MRS
221,Rachel,Then what?
222,Rachel,What do you want?
223,Rachel,MRS
224,Rachel,Why on earth would I understand this?
225,Rachel,MRS
226,Rachel,Oh.
227,Monica,"All right people, we're in trouble here."
228,Monica,We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left.
229,Monica,"Move, move, move!"
230,Chandler,"Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles."
231,Monica,"Joey, speed it up!"
232,Joey,"I'm sorry, it's the pigs."
233,Joey,they're reluctant to get in the blankets!
234,Phoebe,"Monica, how did this happen?"
235,Phoebe,I thought you had this all planned out.
236,Monica,Do you want me to cry?
237,Monica,Is that what you want?
238,Monica,Do you wanna see me cry?
239,Phoebe,Sir!
240,Phoebe,No sir!
241,Monica,"All right, you!"
242,Ross,No.
243,Ross,"Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing."
244,Monica,"All right, look, Ross."
245,Monica,"I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do."
246,Monica,"But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called ""pigs in Ross""."
247,Monica,"All right, ball the melon."
248,Chandler,Hey!
249,Chandler,"How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon."
250,Monica,Hi.
251,Monica,It's goin' great.
252,Monica,Right on schedule.
253,Monica,Got my little happy helpers.
254,Ross,What's the matter?
255,Ross,What?
256,Monica,"You're still gonna pay me, right?"
257,Monica,Or something a little less selfish.
258,Ross,"Carol, what's the matter?"
259,Ross,What happened?
260,Ross,Oh my god.
261,Ross,It's ok.
262,Ross,I'm sorry.
263,Ross,"I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right."
264,Ross,"Look, do you love her?"
265,Ross,And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.
266,Ross,Well then that's it.
267,Ross,"And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them."
268,Ross,"Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me."
269,Ross,"Look, this is your wedding."
270,Ross,Do it.
271,Monica,So we're back on?
272,Monica,You heard the woman.
273,Monica,"Peel, chop, devil!"
274,Monica,I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.
275,Joey,"It just seems so futile, you know ?"
276,Joey,"All these women, and nothing."
277,Joey,"I feel like Superman without my powers, you know?"
278,Joey,"I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly."
279,Chandler,"Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok?"
280,Chandler,The world is my lesbian wedding.
281,Phoebe,Butterscotch?
282,Phoebe,No one?
283,Phoebe,"All right, you'll be sorry later."

295,Joey,I wrapped those bad boys.
296,Phoebe,I miss Rose.
297,Chandler,"Oh, yeah?"
298,Phoebe,"I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone."
299,Phoebe,"Ok, that's so nice."

8,Rachel,I didn't know there were docks.
9,Joey,Hey.
10,Chandler,Hey.
11,Ross,"Aww, is it broken?"
12,Joey,"No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks."
13,Rachel,Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
14,Joey,Nooo.
15,Joey,I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
16,Chandler,"Well, I'm sorry Joe."
17,Chandler,I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
18,Joey,What is this?
19,Joey,Fruit?
20,Rachel,Monica's making jam.
21,Joey,"Whoa, jam!"
22,Joey,I love jam!
23,Joey,"Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?"
24,Chandler,Because the kids need new shoes.
25,Monica,I'm going into business people.
26,Monica,I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard.
27,Monica,"I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man."
28,Monica,What's the opposite of man?
29,Monica,Jam.
30,Monica,Oh Joey don't!
31,Monica,It's way to hot.

35,Phoebe,Hey!
36,Phoebe,You!
37,Phoebe,J.
38,Phoebe,Crew guy.

40,Phoebe,Why have you been following me?
41,Phoebe,"I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you."
42,Phoebe,What?
43,Phoebe,Oooh.
44,Phoebe,"Oh, well this is awkward."
45,Phoebe,"Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe."

47,Phoebe,Seriously.
48,Phoebe,"Oh, you're not a dingus."
49,Phoebe,"Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know."
50,Phoebe,"I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay."
51,Phoebe,"Wait,  you know what, I got a little story."
52,Phoebe,When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch.
53,Phoebe,"And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot."
54,Phoebe,"He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.'"
55,Phoebe,See what I'm saying?
56,Phoebe,"Um, well, get over it."
57,Phoebe,"So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know."
58,Phoebe,Don't be so hard on yourself okay.
59,Phoebe,"Oh, thanks a lot."
60,Phoebe,Do you want to get a cup of coffee?
61,Phoebe,Okay.
62,Phoebe,"Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more."
63,Rachel,Mon?
64,Ross,Mon?
65,Rachel,'Gone for more jars.
66,Rachel,Back later.
67,Rachel,Monica Geller.'
68,Ross,"Wait a minute, look."
69,Rachel,What?
70,Ross,"Look, look, look."
71,Rachel,"What, what, what?"
72,Ross,It's an empty apartment.
73,Rachel,Oooh.
74,Ross,We're all alone in an empty apartment.
75,Rachel,"Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes  Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything."
76,Ross,There it is.
77,Rachel,"Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about."
78,Rachel,Hey.
79,Ross,Hey.
80,Chandler,Do I look fat?
81,Chandler,Ross and
82,Rachel,Noo.
83,Chandler,"Okay, I accept that."
84,Chandler,"When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow."
85,Rachel,"Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it."
86,Chandler,"Okay, well."
87,Chandler,"Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?'"
88,Chandler,"And I, I looked at her...."
89,Ross,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
90,Ross,You looked at her.
91,Ross,You never look.
92,Ross,"You just answer, it's just a reflex."
93,Ross,Do I look fat?
94,Ross,Nooo!
95,Ross,Is she prettier than I am?
96,Ross,Noo!
97,Ross,Does size matter?
98,Rachel,Nooo!
99,Ross,And it works both ways.
100,Chandler,"Okay, so you both just know this stuff?"
101,Rachel,"Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on."
102,Ross,"Okay, for instance."
103,Ross,"Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options."
104,Ross,Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport.
105,Ross,Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim.
106,Ross,Which do you do?
107,Chandler,"That's easy, baggage claim."
108,Ross,Wrong!
109,Ross,Now you're single.
110,Ross,"It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate."
111,Ross,That way she knows you love her.
112,Chandler,"Okay, this is good, this is good."
113,Chandler,"All right listen, I have one."
114,Chandler,"Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for."
115,Chandler,"But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space."
116,Chandler,"So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something."
117,Rachel,"Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers."
118,Rachel,"Okay, I'm late for work."
119,Ross,Oh.
120,Rachel,All right are you guys gonna come down?
121,Ross,"Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you."
122,Rachel,Good luck Chandler.
123,Chandler,Thank you Rachel.
124,Ross,Bye sweetie.
125,Rachel,Bye hon.
126,Ross,Okay the sleeping thing.
127,Ross,"Very tricky business, but there is something you can do."
128,Chandler,"Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers."
129,Ross,Noo!
130,Ross,"No, not cuddlily, not me, just her."
131,Ross,"I'm like you, I need the room."
132,Ross,"Okay, come here."
133,Ross,"Okay, you're in bed..."
134,Chandler,Yeah.
135,Ross,I'm gonna use the cushion.
136,Chandler,Yeah.
137,Ross,"Okay, you're in bed."
138,Ross,"She's over on your side, cuddling."
139,Ross,"Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her  and roll her back over to her side of the bed."
140,Ross,And then you rollll a-way.
141,Ross,Hug for her!
142,Ross,Roll for you.
143,Chandler,"Okay, the old hug and roll."
144,Ross,Yep.
145,Chandler,"Okay, one question."
146,Ross,Shoot.
147,Chandler,You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
148,Joey,Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
149,Rachel,You're so pretty.
150,Phoebe,Hi!
151,Phoebe,"Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me?"
152,Phoebe,I talked to him today.
153,Joey,You talked to him.
154,Joey,Are you crazy?
155,Phoebe,"Okay, first I'm not crazy."
156,Phoebe,"And second, say it don't spray it."
157,Phoebe,"Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick."
158,Phoebe,"And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me."
159,Phoebe,'Cause of the restraining order.
160,Chandler,"Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom."
161,Phoebe,Ooh!
162,Phoebe,"No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no."
163,Phoebe,"He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know."
164,Phoebe,"And we just get along really well, and he's so cute."
165,Ross,"Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker."
166,Phoebe,"No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her."
167,Joey,"Hey, I didn't stalk her."
168,Joey,I mean
169,Phoebe,"Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather."
170,Monica,Hey guys.
171,Monica,"Joey, this is for you."
172,Monica,It's blackberry curin.
173,Joey,Aww.
174,Joey,Ohh!
175,Chandler,"Hey, Joe, I gotta ask."
176,Chandler,"The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam."
177,Joey,Put your hands together.
178,Monica,"Joey, take your time with that."
179,Monica,That's my last batch.
180,Joey,No more jam?
181,Rachel,"Well, what happened to your jam plan?"
182,Monica,I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even.
183,Monica,"So, I've got a new plan now."
184,Monica,Babies.
185,Chandler,"Well, your gonna need much bigger jars."
186,Ross,What are you talking about?
187,Monica,I'm talking about me having a baby.
188,Ross,What?
189,Rachel,Are you serious?
190,Monica,Yeah.
191,Monica,"The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life."
192,Monica,"So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan."
193,Ross,"Well, aren't you forgetin' something?"
194,Ross,"What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name?"
195,Ross,Dad!
196,Monica,"It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid."
197,Chandler,"That, that's what's stupid."
198,Monica,"I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers."
199,Monica,"And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff."
200,Rachel,Down at the docks again?
201,Chandler,Night-night.....Janice.
202,Chandler,"'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there."
203,Chandler,That would be weird though.
204,Chandler,"Okay, hug and roll time."
205,Chandler,"I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes!"
206,Chandler,Freedom!
207,Chandler,Except for this arm!
208,Chandler,I'm stuck.
209,Chandler,Stuck arm!
210,Chandler,"Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion."
211,Chandler,"Quick like a cat, quick like a cat!"
212,Chandler,And 1...2...3!'
213,Chandler,Commercial Break

215,Phoebe,Great.

219,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah."
220,Phoebe,What's this?
221,Phoebe,"Um, not even a little bit."
222,Phoebe,"Oh, okay then."
223,Phoebe,Good.
224,Phoebe,So what were you thinking?
225,Phoebe,Really?
226,Phoebe,Oh.
227,Phoebe,"Oh, okay."
228,Chandler,"No, that's all right."
229,Chandler,I just had a jar of mustard.
230,Monica,"Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down!"
231,Monica,"Okay, he's 6'2"", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis."
232,Chandler,You mean there's more than one of us.
233,Ross,"Look, you can't do this Mon."
234,Ross,"All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna....."
235,Monica,You're gonna what?
236,Ross,I'm gonna tell Mom.
237,Rachel,"Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right."
238,Rachel,"I love you, but you're crazy."
239,Ross,Crazy.
240,Monica,What?!
241,Monica,Why?
242,Monica,Why is this crazy?
243,Monica,So this isn't the ideal way to something....
244,Ross,"Oh, it's not the ideal way..."
245,Monica,"Lips moving, still talking."
246,Monica,"I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready."
247,Monica,"No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you."
248,Monica,"It makes me ache, you know?"
249,Joey,Check it out!!
250,Joey,Jam crackers!
251,Monica,"Okay, all right, how's this?"
252,Monica,27.
253,Monica,Italian-American guy.
254,Monica,"He's an actor, born in Queens."
255,Monica,"Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy."
256,Monica,"Oh my God, under personal"
257,Joey,"Yeah, the Knicks rule!"
258,Monica,"Joey, this is you!"
259,Joey,Let me see.
260,Joey,"Oh, right."
261,Rachel,When did you go to a sperm bank?
262,Joey,"Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU."
263,Joey,"Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?"
264,Chandler,And that's how you bought it?
265,Joey,"Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated."
266,Joey,I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
267,Monica,"Well, honey, it is pretty competitive."
268,Monica,I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
269,Joey,"Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here."
270,Joey,"You know, juice this puppy up a little."
271,Phoebe,Hellooo!
272,Ross,How's the maniac?
273,Phoebe,"Oh, well he's yummy."
274,Phoebe,We did a little kissin'.
275,Rachel,"Phoebe, what are you doing?"
276,Phoebe,"Oh, no, no, no, no."
277,Phoebe,"You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore."
278,Phoebe,He quit for me.
279,Rachel,"Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that."
280,Phoebe,"Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything."
281,Ross,You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
282,Phoebe,"What, he's not still following her."
283,Phoebe,Do you think he is still following her?
284,Chandler,"Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order."
285,Phoebe,What are you saying I should do?
286,Monica,"I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him."
287,Phoebe,"Thank you, Monica."
288,Joey,"Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes."
289,Monica,"Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine."
290,Rachel,"Oh my God, what happened?"
291,Rachel,Wow!
292,Rachel,Spinning that sounds like fun.
293,Rachel,Ross's what?
294,Phoebe,Yes?
295,Phoebe,Yes!
296,Phoebe,Oh.
297,Phoebe,"Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich."
298,Phoebe,"Oh, here it is!"
299,Phoebe,Oh.
300,Phoebe,"Um, perhaps."
301,Phoebe,Yes!
302,Phoebe,"Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
303,Phoebe,I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
304,Phoebe,"Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister."
305,Phoebe,Just walkin' along looking like me.
306,Phoebe,"What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?"
307,Phoebe,"No, no, it's not your fault."
308,Phoebe,"You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey."
309,Phoebe,"Sorry, no."
310,Phoebe,"Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know  Wow!"
311,Phoebe,"But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister."
312,Phoebe,"Okay, stalk me for a while."
313,Phoebe,Huh?
314,Phoebe,"Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch."
315,Phoebe,"Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going."
316,Phoebe,"Um, come on."
317,Phoebe,"Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?"
318,Joey,Hey.

325,Monica,"Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135."

327,Monica,'Fraid so.
328,Monica,"Brown hair, green eyes..."
329,Joey,"No kiddin', hmm."
330,Monica,What?
331,Joey,"No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy."
332,Monica,Really?
333,Monica,Why?
334,Joey,"I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt."
335,Monica,Hoyt?
336,Joey,"It's a name, yeah."
337,Joey,"I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool."
338,Monica,"Really, is he a swimmer?"
339,Joey,He's got the body for it.
340,Monica,I like that.
341,Monica,What?
342,Joey,You guys have one of those signs that
343,Monica,We do not have one of those signs.
344,Joey,"Sure you do, it was a gift from me."
345,Joey,Oh!
346,Joey,And you have these three great kids.
347,Monica,Two girls and a boy?
348,Joey,Yeah!
349,Monica,"And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know."
350,Monica,"And they're, they're running around on the deck."
351,Monica,Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
352,Joey,Sure!
353,Joey,"But hey, you know this way sounds good too."
354,Monica,Yeah.
355,Joey,Oh Monica.
356,Joey,"Wow, this guy's an astronaut."
357,Joey,"That would've been cool,  for like a day."
358,Joey,Closing Credits
359,Joey,"I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni."
360,Joey,Nobody wants my product.
361,Joey,"I mean, I-I-I don't get it  Maybe if they met me in person."
362,Rachel,"Honey, you got a little thing on your..."
363,Joey,Did I get it?
364,Rachel,Yeah.
365,Ross,Hello.
366,Rachel,Hello.
367,Ross,Hey.
368,Ross,"Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?"
369,Chandler,Sure.
370,Chandler,What's up?
371,Ross,"Just one uh, one additional relationship thought."
372,Ross,"Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk!"
373,Ross,End
0,Ross,Hey you guys!
1,Phoebe,Hey!
2,Ross,"Hey, what are you doing?"
3,Chandler,"That's funny, we were doing the same thing!"
4,Ross,Yeah!
5,Phoebe,It's really crazy!
6,Phoebe,"The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea    how expensive this stuff was!"
7,Chandler,Yeah it is really pricey.
8,Chandler,"I mean, I freaked when I first heard the    numbers."
9,Phoebe,So what did you two do about it?
10,Chandler,"It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting    solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell."
11,Ross,"There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact    that this is gonna cost you a lot of money."
12,Ross,"Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that."
13,Phoebe,"But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?"
14,Phoebe,Yeah!
15,Phoebe,"Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity    and we just got married at City Hall?"
16,Ross,"I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!"
17,Chandler,Maybe you do that next time you get married!
18,Ross,"No, no, no."
19,Ross,The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset.
20,Ross,But    maybe the time after that!
21,Ross,Opening Credits
22,Joey,Hey!
23,Chandler,Hey!
24,Joey,What's going on?
25,Chandler,Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning    the apartment.
26,Monica,We?
27,Chandler,You know you don't want me to help.
28,Chandler,You can't have it both ways!
29,Joey,"Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?"
30,Chandler,Kind of.
31,Chandler,She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
32,Monica,"And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about    us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state."
33,Joey,"Hey, maybe I should stop by!"
34,Joey,She could be a soap opera fan!
35,Joey,It's very    impressive when the little people know a celebrity.
36,Chandler,Little people?
37,Joey,Celebrity.
38,Monica,"Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff    hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?"
39,Chandler,What...?
40,Chandler,NO!
41,Monica,Chandler?
42,Chandler,"I don't, and I'm offended    by the insinuation!"
43,Monica,"Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes    taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?"
44,Chandler,"I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not    mine."
45,Monica,It isn't mine!
46,Joey,"Well, I guess we'll never know whose    it is!"
47,Phoebe,Yes.
48,Phoebe,We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.
49,Phoebe,Charity
50,Phoebe,"Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one  Charity"
51,Phoebe,And we don't want any recognition.
52,Phoebe,This is completely anonymous.
53,Phoebe,Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.
54,Phoebe,Charity
55,Phoebe,Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.
56,Phoebe,"Sure, I so glad we did this."
57,Phoebe,It feels so good!
58,Phoebe,"Oh, look!"
59,Phoebe,And we get these free t-shirts!
60,Phoebe,Charity
61,Phoebe,Mhm... it's moist.
62,Ross,Hi!
63,Rachel,Hi!
64,Rachel,Emma will be up in a minute!
65,Ross,"Oh, good!"
66,Rachel,Oh hey Ross...
67,Rachel,"Listen, I heard about you and Charlie."
68,Rachel,I'm really sorry.
69,Ross,"Oh, that's OK."
70,Ross,I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists    out there.
71,Rachel,Absolutely.
72,Ross,There was one!
73,Ross,She's it!
74,Ross,All the rest look like they should live under    a bridge!
75,Rachel,"So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?"
76,Ross,"Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!"
77,Rachel,"Oh my God, what!"
78,Ross,Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and    fire!
79,Rachel,"Ok, look, Ross."
80,Rachel,I do not want Emma going to the playground.
81,Ross,Be-caaauuuse...
82,Rachel,"All right, well, if you must know..."
83,Rachel,I had a traumatic... swing    incident... when I was little.
84,Ross,Seriously?
85,Rachel,"Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden    my hair got tangled in the chain."
86,Rachel,And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut    a big chunk of my hair!
87,Rachel,And it was uneven for weeks!
88,Ross,And you made it through that?
89,Ross,I wonder who's gonna play you    in the movie!
90,Rachel,"Ok, fine!"
91,Rachel,You can make fun of me.
92,Rachel,I do not want Emma going there.
93,Rachel,And    I was thinking Claire Danes.
94,Ross,"Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok?"
95,Ross,"But the swings are perfectly    safe, and besides Emma loves them."
96,Ross,"You know what, you should come with us and    you'll see!"
97,Rachel,"Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour!"
98,Rachel,Ok?
99,Rachel,"When you're... and    there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're    gonna return back to earth!"
100,Ross,Space is filled with orbiting children.
101,Ross,"Look, please, just come    on, you know, when you’ll see the look on Emma’s face, I swear you    won’t regret it."
102,Rachel,All right!
103,Ross,"Good, you don’t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their    irrational fears on their children, do you?"
104,Rachel,"Irrational, huh?"
105,Rachel,"All right, well, I’ll remember that the next    time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!"
106,Ross,"Oh, yeah, that’s the same, I am sure there are thirty different    species of poisonous swings!"
107,Monica,"Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!"
108,Chandler,"Ok, ok, here we go."
109,Monica,Ok.
110,Chandler,Here we go.
111,Chandler,Stand up straight.
112,Chandler,Big smile.
113,Phoebe,"Hello, is this the creepy residence?"
114,Monica,"We’re waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I’m glad    you’re here."
115,Monica,I was cleaning this morning and I found this .
116,Monica,"I don’t know if you wanna use it, but…"
117,Phoebe,"Awe, this is so sweet of you!"
118,Phoebe,But you know what?
119,Phoebe,"I won’t be needing    a veil, I actually won’t be wearing a dress at all!"
120,Monica,I told you!
121,Monica,I am not coming to a naked wedding!
122,Phoebe,"No, no, no, we’re not having a big reception, we took the money    we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity."
123,Monica,That’s crazy!
124,Monica,I am sorry.
125,Monica,I just can’t    imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!
126,Phoebe,"We, you know, we’re different!"
127,Phoebe,We don’t care about having    a huge party.
128,Phoebe,"This is really nice for you, but, oh,    please, I put this on?"
129,Phoebe,"And, ow, I look , why, well, radiant."
130,Phoebe,"All right, well, who cares,    I don’t need a pretty veil and a fancy dress."
131,Monica,That’s right.
132,Monica,"You’re making a commitment and that’s    the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?"
133,Phoebe,City Hall.
134,Monica,Ow!
135,Monica,"Oh, that sounds nice!"
136,Monica,I am just    there for jury duty.
137,Monica,They really spruce that place up!
138,Phoebe,"It’s ok, it’s ok."
139,Phoebe,I made my decision.
140,Phoebe,What I really want    is a great big wedding
141,Monica,Yay!
142,Chandler,But you already gave all your money to charity!
143,Phoebe,"Well, I’ll just ask for it back!"
144,Chandler,I don’t think you can do that!
145,Monica,Why not!
146,Monica,"This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some    stupid kids!"
147,Chandler,"That’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady."
148,Rachel,"Ok, careful."
149,Ross,Ok.
150,Rachel,"Careful, watch her hair."
151,Rachel,WATCH HER HAIR!
152,Ross,"Rach, she’s got like three hairs!"
153,Rachel,I know  but they’re just so beautiful!
154,Rachel,"Oh, my God, I just pulled one out."
155,Ross,I promise you she’s safe!
156,Ross,No watch how much she loves this.
157,Rachel,Ok. Ross
158,Rachel,Ok.
159,Ross,Here we go!
160,Rachel,"Ok, careful, ok.  Oh, she’s smiling!"
161,Rachel,"Oh my God,    she does like it!"
162,Ross,"See, I told you!"
163,Rachel,Awe!
164,Rachel,Oh my God!
165,Rachel,"Looks, she’s a little dare-devil!"
166,Rachel,"Oh, let me push, can I push?"
167,Ross,"Oh, absolutely!"
168,Rachel,Ok. Oh God.
169,Rachel,"Get the camera, it’s in the diaper bag."
170,Ross,Ok!
171,Ross,See?
172,Ross,"Scared    of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly  Ow!"
173,Phoebe,It’s for our wedding day!
174,Phoebe,"Right, now, is this guy gay or straight,    because one of us gonna have to start flirting."
175,Phoebe,Charity
176,Phoebe,"The donation we made earlier, we k…, we w…, we want it    back."
177,Phoebe,Charity
178,Phoebe,Yeah.
179,Phoebe,"See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn’t    want, but it turns out we do."
180,Phoebe,Charity
181,Phoebe,I am sorry.
182,Phoebe,"I am, but this wedding is just really important to me."
183,Phoebe,Charity
184,Phoebe,"Hey, that’s not fair!"
185,Phoebe,A person’s wedding is important!
186,Phoebe,And especially to me!
187,Phoebe,Ok?
188,Phoebe,I didn’t have a graduation party!
189,Phoebe,And I didn’t    go to Prom.
190,Phoebe,And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an    escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to “kill me”    or whatever.
191,Phoebe,So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty    little man make me feel badly about it.
192,Monica,"Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler."
193,Monica,Please come in.
194,Monica,Would you like something to drink?
195,Monica,Ok. Great.
196,Monica,I am so glad that you are here.
197,Monica,We’re really excited    about getting this process started.
198,Chandler,"Oh, because we love kids."
199,Chandler,"Love ‘em to death.Well, not actually    to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount...    as allowed by law."
200,Monica,"Ah, thank you."
201,Monica,This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.
202,Monica,Is that that couple on the first floor?
203,Monica,Because we should get a baby    before    them.
204,Monica,Yeah!
205,Monica,That guy tried to sell me drugs.
206,Chandler,"But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building."
207,Chandler,What?
208,Monica,Really?
209,Monica,What is it?
210,Monica,Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?
211,Chandler,Of course it was!
212,Chandler,RAT BASTARD!
213,Chandler,OH GOD NO!
214,Chandler,"Nope, no, no, no."
215,Chandler,No!
216,Chandler,"No, no."
217,Chandler,Nope!
218,Chandler,"No, no,    no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
219,Chandler,NO!
220,Chandler,No!
221,Joey,Hellooo?
222,Joey,Anybody in there order a celebrity?
223,Joey,OW!
224,Chandler,"Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here."
225,Chandler,He's great    with    kids though.
226,Rachel,"Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?"
227,Ross,SON OF A BITCH!
228,Ross,Oh relax!
229,Ross,I didn't say the 'F' word!
230,Rachel,"Ross, see!"
231,Rachel,"I told you, those swings are evil!"
232,Rachel,"Alright, that is it."
233,Rachel,That is    the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life.
234,Ross,No!
235,Ross,"No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault."
236,Ross,It was my fault    and kind    of that  kids fault.
237,Ross,Who is still laughing.
238,Ross,Nice.
239,Rachel,"Ross, c'mon, please."
240,Rachel,"Can we just get out of here, before somebody else    gets    hurt?"
241,Ross,"No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea."
242,Ross,"I want you to get on the swing,    okay?"
243,Ross,And    you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of.
244,Rachel,I know what this is all about... You've    always been    jealous of my hair.
245,Ross,"Look, I just think you're an adult, okay?"
246,Ross,And you should get over your    silly    fears.
247,Rachel,Alright fine.
248,Rachel,I'll do it.
249,Ross,Good.
250,Rachel,If you hold a spider.
251,Ross,WHAT?
252,Ross,WHERE?
253,Ross,WHERE?
254,Rachel,IF you hold a spider.
255,Ross,I know.
256,Joey,Guys?
257,Joey,Everything ok?
258,Joey,"It's me, Joe..."
259,Chandler,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!
260,Chandler,"Oh, just like I said."
261,Chandler,That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls.
262,Joey,Guys!
263,Monica,Keep on roaming Bert!
264,Monica,We don't want any crazy today!
265,Joey,What's going on?
266,Chandler,"WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT."
267,Chandler,EVERYTHNG'S FINE!
268,Joey,Everything doesn't sound fine!
269,Chandler,Oh yeah!
270,Chandler,He has a caretaker.
271,Chandler,His older brother... Ernie.
272,Chandler,You can't make this stuff up!
273,Phoebe,Oh!
274,Phoebe,It ended okay.
275,Phoebe,One of my friends shot him.
276,Phoebe,"Yeah, I really do."
277,Phoebe,"You know, I had nothing growing up."
278,Phoebe,Just like the kids I took the money from.
279,Phoebe,"Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now."
280,Phoebe,It's tainted.
281,Phoebe,"And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend hasn't    shot    anyone in a really long time."
282,Monica,"Oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the    furniture,    because, believe me, you won't find any porn or cigarettes under there!"
283,Monica,Why don't I show you the baby's room?
284,Chandler,What the hell are you doing?
285,Joey,"Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble."
286,Chandler,"Well, we're not."
287,Joey,But you called me 'Bert'!?
288,Joey,That's our code word for danger!
289,Chandler,We don't have a code word.
290,Joey,We don't?
291,Joey,We really should.
292,Joey,"From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word    for danger."
293,Monica,So that was the baby's room.
294,Monica,What room should we see next?
295,Chandler,Any room that isn't behind this couch!
296,Monica,"Some people    don't    get him, but I think he's really funny!"
297,Joey,I did not care for that!
298,Chandler,You have to get out of here.
299,Chandler,"You slept    with    our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so    she can't    see you."
300,Joey,"Ok, ok!"
301,Chandler,Ok!
302,Chandler,What?
303,Joey,I forgot my bat.
304,Chandler,"And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you!"
305,Chandler,And    we don't want to buy your bat!
306,Joey,Bert!
307,Joey,Bert!
308,Joey,Bert!
309,Joey,Bert!
310,Chandler,I can explain... Joey...
311,Joey,"Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back    here."
312,Joey,I can't believe you never called me.
313,Joey,Oh... yeah...
314,Joey,Probably you don't even remember my name.
315,Joey,"It's Joey, by    the way."
316,Joey,"And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it...    lady."
317,Joey,Yeah!
318,Joey,I waited weeks for you to call me.
319,Joey,"No, no!"
320,Joey,"Don't try to turn this around on me, ok?"
321,Joey,"I'm not some kind of...    social work, ok, that you can just... do."
322,Joey,Really?
323,Joey,Think about it.
324,Joey,Come on!
325,Joey,"You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny,    we had a really good time, huh?"
326,Joey,"If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?"
327,Joey,"No, no, hey, no!"
328,Joey,Too late for apologies... ok?
329,Joey,You broke my heart.
330,Joey,You    know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you?
331,Joey,NO!
332,Joey,"I waited a long time, I can't wait anymore..."
333,Chandler,"Oh, that's really ok."
334,Monica,"Yeah, that we totally understand."
335,Monica,Dating is hard.
336,Joey,LAURA!
337,Phoebe,We're back!
338,Phoebe,Charity
339,Phoebe,"Yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all about the children."
340,Phoebe,"Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here."
341,Phoebe,No... Oh God... Oh!
342,Phoebe,Charity
343,Phoebe,But... but... but we're giving you this!
344,Phoebe,Charity
345,Phoebe,"Well, this is very generous!"
346,Phoebe,Charity
347,Phoebe,"Oh, is that you?"
348,Phoebe,Charity
349,Monica,Hello...?
350,Monica,Oh hi... Oh my God...!
351,Monica,Really...?
352,Monica,"I can't wait to tell Chandler...    Ok, goodbye."
353,Chandler,Wrong number?
354,Monica,It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on    the waiting list.
355,Chandler,That's great!
356,Monica,Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's    a baby waiting for us.
357,Monica,Oh...
358,Chandler,Hello...?
359,Chandler,Have you seen Joey's bat?
360,Chandler,COMMERCIAL BREAK
361,Rachel,Ok...
362,Rachel,I got a spider.
363,Rachel,"There were two, I picked the bigger one."
364,Ross,Ok...
365,Rachel,Ok...
366,Ross,This feels perfectly normal.
367,Ross,"Ok,    get on the swing!"
368,Rachel,Ok... O-k...
369,Rachel,Ok...
370,Rachel,whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!
371,Ross,See?
372,Rachel,A-alright!
373,Rachel,I can do this.
374,Ross,There you go!
375,Ross,Good for you!
376,Ross,"And you know what, I'm actually getting used    to this little guy."
377,Ross,I don't really even feel him in here anymore.
378,Rachel,That's because he's on your neck.
379,Ross,Well...  Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...
380,Rachel,ROSS!
381,Rachel,end
0,Joey,"Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?"
1,Monica,"I won't give you anything, but you'll owe me 2.95."
2,Joey,Done.
3,Phoebe,Hey.
4,Phoebe,I need an atlas!
5,Phoebe,I need an atlas!
6,Monica,Why?
7,Monica,Do you have a report due?
8,Phoebe,"I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages outside the UN and, I don't know where his country is."
9,Monica,"Okay, let's start with the free messages outside the UN."
10,Phoebe,Oh!!
11,Phoebe,That's my new thing.
12,Phoebe,"I figure bodies at peace, make peace."
13,Monica,Wow!
14,Monica,You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing.
15,Monica,So what country is this guy from?
16,Phoebe,Ick-neck-tree-anis.....
17,Phoebe,There's a g' in there.
18,Monica,Where's that?
19,Phoebe,In your atlas!
20,Monica,I don't have an atlas.
21,Phoebe,Oh.
22,Monica,"Oh, but wait I do have a globe."
23,Phoebe,Oh.
24,Monica,Hold on.
25,Joey,So Pheebs what's this guy like?
26,Phoebe,"Umm, well he's very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very sophisticated, and he doesn't speak any English, but according to his translator, he totally gets me."
27,Monica,"Kay, here you go."
28,Phoebe,What is this?
29,Monica,"It's a globe and, a pencil sharpener."
30,Chandler,"Hey, does anybody need anything copied?"
31,Chandler,I'm going down to the Xerox place.
32,Monica,"Oh, no thanks."
33,Chandler,"Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of."
34,Monica,"Well, if you don't have anything to copy, why are you going down there?"
35,Joey,"Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?"
36,Chandler,Yeah!
37,Chandler,You wanna come?
38,Joey,Yeah!
39,Joey,Opening Credits
40,Chandler,Come on Chloe!
41,Chandler,Finish up with your customer first.
42,Chandler,Come on Chloe!
43,Chandler,Come on Chloe!
44,Chandler,Uh-oh.
45,Joey,"Uh, y'know what, we're having second thoughts about our copying needs."
46,Joey,And we'll need a little more time to think about it.
47,Chandler,"Okay, that hurt us."
48,Chandler,"Well ah, ........y'know."
49,Joey,Both of us?
50,Joey,We'll be there.
51,Chandler,"All right, rock on."
52,Phoebe,Me too.
53,Phoebe,"Although this city is my home, so."
54,Phoebe,"So that's dumb what I said, don't tell him I said that."
55,Phoebe,"Umm, you make something up."
56,Phoebe,"Nice,  thank you."
57,Phoebe,This is me.
58,Phoebe,Here.
59,Phoebe,"Thank you, very much!"
60,Phoebe,Oh!
61,Phoebe,Thank you!
62,Phoebe,"Okay, y'know what, you don't have to do that now."
63,Phoebe,No-no-no-no!!
64,Phoebe,"Not him, you don't!"
65,Phoebe,Well the moment's over.
66,Phoebe,Oh.
67,Phoebe,See there it is right there.
68,Monica,Wow!
69,Monica,It's small.
70,Phoebe,Yeah.
71,Phoebe,But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
72,Monica,"So you had fun, huh?"
73,Phoebe,Yeah.
74,Phoebe,"Except for, y'know when you're on a date and you're getting along really great but the guy's translator keeps getting in the way."
75,Monica,No.
76,Ross,Hey.
77,Ross,Phoebe and
78,Monica,Hey.
79,Ross,"What is ah, Rach in her room?"
80,Monica,"Oh no, she's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her."
81,Ross,Oh what?!
82,Ross,Is she gonna cancel on me again?!
83,Ross,How can she do this?
84,Ross,Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?
85,Monica,"All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject."
86,Monica,Call Rachel.
87,Ross,What's that on the bottom?
88,Monica,"Oh that's my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat."
89,Monica,She's fancy.
90,Rachel,Hello.
91,Ross,"Hey, honey."
92,Rachel,"Oh, hi."
93,Ross,"Hey, what's going on?"
94,Rachel,"Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I've got to get this order in."
95,Rachel,"Honey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night."
96,Ross,"What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?"
97,Rachel,"No-no-no, no, honey please, I've got, I've just have so much to deal with."
98,Phoebe,"Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date?"
99,Phoebe,"So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off."
100,Phoebe,"Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute."
101,Monica,"Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?"
102,Phoebe,"Hey, don't call him that!"
103,Phoebe,His name is Spackel Back Harry!
104,Chandler,"Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going."
105,Chandler,I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
106,Joey,"Uh,"
107,Chandler,What time is it now?
108,Chandler,"Yeah all right, so we'll hang out."
109,Joey,Yeah.
110,Joey,"Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?"
111,Chandler,Yes.
112,Chandler,Vividly.
113,Joey,She was kidding about that right?
114,Chandler,"Yeah, I-I-I think so."
115,Chandler,"Yeah, I-I think so..."
116,Joey,"God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?"
117,Chandler,Yeah.
118,Chandler,"Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?"
119,Joey,"Dude, I don't know."
120,Chandler,She was kidding.
121,Joey,Yeah.
122,Chandler,She was....
123,Chandler,"But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules."
124,Joey,"Yeah, for sure."
125,Joey,Okay.
126,Joey,"Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes."
127,Joey,"Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing."
128,Chandler,Yeah.
129,Chandler,"Good call, nice one."
130,Chandler,Hold it!!

140,Joey,"Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?"
141,Chandler,"Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you."
142,Rachel,"No, no, no, I'm looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours."
143,Rachel,"And....  What does it matter, what I'm wearing?!"

169,Rachel,What are you doing?
170,Ross,I'm sorry.
171,Ross,"But ah, hey, oh, somebody's off the phone, how bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again."
172,Rachel,"Ross you're not listening to me, I don't have time to stop."

186,Ross,"No, hey, well, I-I completely understand."
187,Ross,"You were, you were stressed."
188,Rachel,I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
189,Ross,For what?
190,Ross,For letting you throw me out of your office?
191,Rachel,You had no right coming down to my office Ross.
192,Rachel,You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work!
193,Rachel,Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
194,Ross,"Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I."
195,Rachel,"But I told you, I didn't have the time!"
196,Ross,"Yeah, well you never have the time."
197,Ross,"I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel."
198,Rachel,"Wh, Ross what do you want from me?"
199,Rachel,"You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?"
200,Ross,"No, but it'd be nice if you realised, it's just a job!"
201,Rachel,Just a job!
202,Ross,Yes.
203,Rachel,Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about.
204,Rachel,This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at.
205,Rachel,I mean.
206,Rachel,if you don't get that...
207,Ross,"No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time."
208,Ross,"And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine!"
209,Ross,"Okay, I don't know what to do anymore."
210,Rachel,Well neither do I!
211,Ross,Is this about Mark?
212,Rachel,Oh my God.
213,Ross,"Okay, it's not, it's not."
214,Rachel,Oh my God.
215,Rachel,"I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard."
216,Ross,"Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard."
217,Ross,"Okay, what do you want me to do."
218,Rachel,"I don't know, I don't know."
219,Rachel,Urrrgh!
220,Rachel,"Look, maybe we should take a break."
221,Ross,"Okay, okay, fine, you're right."

226,Ross,"Oh, hi Chloe."
227,Chandler,And that's the only colour that comes in.
228,Chandler,"So, what are you doing here?"
229,Chandler,I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
230,Ross,"Yeah, little change in plans."
231,Ross,"Ahh, we're gonna break-up instead."
232,Monica,"Oh, and I can also speak a little French."
233,Monica,Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?
234,Monica,Why?
235,Monica,What did I say?
236,Monica,Oh my God!
237,Monica,No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
238,Phoebe,"Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi."
239,Phoebe,"Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times."
240,Phoebe,You didn't say Boutros Boutros Gali.
241,Phoebe,Interesting.
242,Phoebe,"Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit."
243,Monica,I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
244,Phoebe,"Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please."
245,Phoebe,What are you doing?
246,Monica,"Well, I was having a conversation."
247,Phoebe,"Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other."
248,Monica,What do you want me to do?
249,Monica,Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
250,Phoebe,That would be great.
251,Phoebe,Thank you.
252,Rachel,Hello!
253,Rachel,Oh.

267,Ross,"One person wants to break-up, you break-up."
268,Chandler,"Hey, no way!"
269,Chandler,"Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out."
270,Ross,"Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?"
271,Chandler,"Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!"
272,Chandler,Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
273,Joey,"Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny."
274,Chandler,Why?
275,Chandler,What happened to him?
276,Joey,"Nothing, he's just really believes in that."
277,Rachel,"Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight."
278,Rachel,"I just, it was awful."
279,Rachel,"I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break."
280,Rachel,No.
281,Rachel,"And then I called him, and he wasn't there."
282,Rachel,"Oh, thank you that's very helpful, I'm glad you came over."
283,Rachel,Hello.
284,Ross,Hi!
285,Ross,It's me.
286,Rachel,Hi!

292,Ross,Is that Mark?
293,Rachel,"Umm, honey, look he just came over to...."
294,Ross,Yeah!
295,Ross,Got it!
296,Ross,"Ah, that's okay, thanks."

298,Ross,Okay?
299,Monica,Oh.
300,Monica,Can I have a tissue?
301,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah, sure."
302,Phoebe,"I just hope you, hope you don't accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it."
303,Phoebe,"Well, tell him, apology accepted."
304,Phoebe,"Excuse me, but umm, isn't he paying for your dinner?"
305,Monica,"Hey, the man's dog just died."
306,Monica,It will be my pleasure.
307,Monica,My guy has diplomatic coupons.
308,Monica,Your guy can't even say coupons.
309,Phoebe,Plate!
310,Phoebe,"Yes, plate."
311,Phoebe,"See, we don't need them."
312,Phoebe,Yeah.

316,Rachel,Be home.
317,Rachel,"Be home, be home, be home."
318,Rachel,"Oh, you're not home."
319,Phoebe,Ameri-can.
320,Phoebe,Ameri-can.
321,Phoebe,Y'know it's a very hard language.
322,Phoebe,Let's do it again.

1,Monica,"Hey, let me tell them!"
2,Joey,Sure.
3,Monica,Joey is gonna be a celebrity guest on a game show!

10,Monica,"Oh, that was our favourite game show ever!"
11,Ross,"Except for ""Match game""..."
12,Monica,"Or ""Win, Lose or Draw""."
13,Chandler,What did I marry into?
14,Joey,Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?
15,Monica,"Oh, I can't."
16,Monica,We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party.
17,Phoebe,"Yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing."
18,Ross,"Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing."
19,Ross,I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond.
20,Joey,Seriously?
21,Ross,Yeah-uh!
22,Monica,Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.
23,Chandler,You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
24,Monica,"Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends."
25,Rachel,"Oh God, that's right."
26,Rachel,I blocked that out.
27,Monica,"""I'm a little bit country""..."
28,Ross,"""...and I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll""!"
29,Chandler,I'm leaving you.
30,Chandler,OPENING CREDITS

32,Chandler,Who?
33,Ross,He was roommates with John Rosoff.
34,Ross,He went out with Andrea Tamburino.
35,Ross,She dumped him for Michael Skloff.

37,Ross,"Hey, there's Missy Goldberg."
38,Ross,You gotta remember her.
39,Chandler,"Sure, nice."
40,Ross,Dude.
41,Ross,You're married to my sister.
42,Chandler,"You're right, by saying ""nice"" I'm virtually licking her."
43,Ross,"Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out?"
44,Chandler,Are you asking permission to break the pact?
45,Ross,Yes please.
46,Ross,Hey.
47,Ross,"Hey, check out the flyers for the band."
48,Ross,I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room!
49,Chandler,"Awesome, the name really stands out."
50,Ross,"Thanks to a little something called ""Helvetica Bold 24 point""!"
51,Chandler,"Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!"

67,Ross,"Dude, I was gonna ask her out."
68,Chandler,"I said it first, bro."
69,Ross,"Well, I thought it first, Holmes."
70,Chandler,"Look, if you did..."
71,Ross,Woha!
72,Ross,Wait... What are we doing?
73,Ross,What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl.
74,Ross,"I mean, we can get laid anytime we want."
75,Chandler,Totally.
76,Chandler,I had sex in High school...
77,Ross,Me too.
78,Ross,I'm good at it.
79,Chandler,"All right, I'd say we make a pact."
80,Chandler,Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.
81,Ross,You got it.
82,Chandler,"All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with."
83,Ross,Those are the pacts!
84,Chandler,"Oh, and Sheena Easton."
85,Chandler,But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
86,Ross,"Oh, oh... maybe not you!"
87,Chandler,"Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact."
88,Ross,Thank you.
89,Ross,"All right, here I go."
90,Ross,"Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?"
91,Chandler,Your hands are shaking.
92,Ross,"I know, and I can't stop sweating."
93,Joey,"I know it could be intimidating for regular people to be around celebrities but... relax, I'm just like you!"
94,Joey,Only better looking and richer.
95,Joey,Uhm... ok.
96,Joey,"It's a store, like a supermarket."
97,Joey,Oh!
98,Joey,I see-I see what I did.
99,Joey,"Yeah, ok, ok, uhm..."

109,Phoebe,"Oh my God, it's all so elegant!"
110,Phoebe,When's the dirty stuff starting?
111,Rachel,What?
112,Phoebe,"You know, the strippers, and the guys dancing, and you know, pee-pee's flying about."
113,Rachel,"Pheebs, I... there isn't gonna be any flying about!"
114,Rachel,We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.
115,Phoebe,"Oh, ok."
116,Phoebe,"I see what you're doing, that's fine."
117,Phoebe,"This is all there is, just tea, uh, ok.  Hmmmm... raunchy!"
118,Rachel,"Seriously Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party."
119,Phoebe,Really?

122,Phoebe,I've got a big wad of ones in my purse!
123,Phoebe,Really?
124,Phoebe,"I mean, really?"
125,Phoebe,It's just tea?
126,Rachel,Nooo!
127,Rachel,"Phoebe, of course there is more!"
128,Rachel,"I mean, I'll just go and talk to Monica and get an ETA on the pee-pee's!"
129,Joey,"Ahaha, he might as well just give us the points."
130,Joey,A spoon.
131,Joey,Your hands.
132,Joey,Your face!
133,Joey,"Paper, snow, a ghost!"

149,Joey,Yeah!
150,Ross,"So, Saturday night!"
151,Ross,Great!
152,Ross,"Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?"
153,Ross,It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
154,Ross,That's ok.
155,Ross,"Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!"
156,Ross,"Yeah, why?"
157,Ross,You did?
158,Ross,AND ON MY TURF?
159,Monica,"Hey, where is this guy, it's been over an hour!"

170,Phoebe,"Oh, God!"
171,Phoebe,Rachel?
172,Rachel,Yeah?
173,Phoebe,Are you kidding?
174,Rachel,"All right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!"
175,Phoebe,How old is your phonebook?
176,Monica,"Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!"
177,Phoebe,"Oh God no, I don't wanna see him take his clothes off!"
178,Monica,"Oh, no!"
179,Monica,"I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off!"
180,Monica,You big piece of eye candy!
181,Phoebe,This is how I look when I'm turned on!
182,Phoebe,Shocking!
183,Phoebe,"Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?"
184,Rachel,"No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!"
185,Phoebe,"No, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do anything!"
186,Phoebe,I don't care.
187,Phoebe,We're not paying you 300 dollars for this.
188,Phoebe,"Oh yeah, okay."
189,Phoebe,I'm uptight.
190,Phoebe,"Yeah, that's why I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume!"
191,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?"
192,Monica,"Uh, look, officer... uhm Sir..."

203,Ross,You broke the pact!
204,Chandler,"Ross, that was 16 years ago!"
205,Ross,That doesn't matter!
206,Ross,We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.
207,Chandler,I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair.
208,Chandler,"All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts."
209,Ross,I didn't.

135,Rachel,"Y'know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk."

158,Joey,What if I smack my head on the concrete?
159,Ross,"Well, I'm gonna lie to you Joey, it's a possibility."

48,Joey,"The guy still won't put out, huh?"

51,Phoebe,"Look, I, y'know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y'know he's really interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up?"
52,Joey,"Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean."
53,Phoebe,"No, whad'ya mean?"
54,Phoebe,He's not British.
55,Joey,Maybe he's.
56,Joey,gay.
57,Phoebe,"Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem."
58,Phoebe,"'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something."
59,Rachel,"Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?"
60,Phoebe,"No, I felt it on my hip."
61,Phoebe,You could tell.
62,Monica,"Yo, Bing."
63,Monica,Racquetball in 15 minutes.
64,Chandler,"Joey, be a pal."

70,Rachel,"Yeah, Monica's settin' me up."
71,Joey,"But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh."
72,Rachel,"Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing?"
73,Rachel,"Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity."
74,Chandler,So you really OK about all this?
75,Rachel,"Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on."
76,Rachel,He can press her up against that window as much as he wants.
77,Rachel,"For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing."
78,Ross,Hi guys.
79,Ross,"Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?"
80,Monica,Only if you say his full name.
81,Ross,Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy.
82,Monica,Alright.
83,Joey,You're getting a cat?
84,Ross,"Uh, actually, we're getting a cat."
85,Rachel,Together?
86,Ross,Uh huh.
87,Rachel,Both of you?
88,Ross,Yep.
89,Rachel,Together.
90,Rachel,"Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely."
91,Rachel,"That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time."
92,Ross,Hopefully.
93,Rachel,Well.
94,Rachel,"Woah, look at that!"
95,Rachel,"I gotta go, I gotta date."
96,Rachel,With a man.
97,Rachel,"Um, OK, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a, uh, really good cat."
98,Rachel,"OK, we're not supposed to take these when we leave."
99,Rachel,How long do cats live?
100,Rachel,"Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?"
101,Rachel,That's just great.
102,Rachel,"Oh, right, clink."
103,Rachel,"Oh, no, Michael, it's not you."
104,Rachel,"I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing."
105,Rachel,"It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend."
106,Rachel,I mean he just started going out with her.
107,Rachel,"Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes."
108,Rachel,"Oh, I'm sorry, look at me."
109,Rachel,"OK, Michael, let's talk about you."
110,Rachel,"OK, OK."
111,Rachel,"So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?"
112,Phoebe,"So, I figured it out."
113,Joey,What?
114,Phoebe,Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me.
115,Phoebe,It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.
116,Joey,"Phoebe, that's crazy."
117,Joey,"When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler?"
118,Joey,"I said, ""Excellent butt, great rack."""
119,Phoebe,Really?
120,Phoebe,That's so sweet.
121,Phoebe,"I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet."
122,Joey,"Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him."
123,Phoebe,"You're right, you're right."
124,Phoebe,"Ah, you are so yumm."
125,Rachel,"I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat."
126,Rachel,"Why can't they get one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day or something?"
127,Rachel,"What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?"
128,Rachel,Yes!
129,Rachel,Thank you.
130,Rachel,"Oh, you're not having fun, are you?"
131,Rachel,"Oh, look at me, look at me."
132,Rachel,"Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie."
133,Rachel,I just want to get over him.
134,Rachel,"gosh, why can't I do that?"
135,Rachel,Yeah!
136,Rachel,Closure.
137,Rachel,"That's what it is, that's what I need."
138,Rachel,"God, you're brilliant!"
139,Rachel,Why didn't I think of that?
140,Rachel,How do I get that?
141,Rachel,"Closure, that's what it is."
142,Rachel,Closure.
143,Rachel,"Hello, excuse me."
144,Rachel,"Excuse me, hel."
145,Rachel,woo
146,Rachel,"Hello, excuse me."
147,Rachel,"Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute."
148,Rachel,I can see that.
149,Rachel,"I... just one phone call, I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it myself."
150,Rachel,"OK, you're bein' a little weird about your phone."
151,Rachel,Thank you.
152,Rachel,OK.   Machine.
153,Rachel,Just waiting for the beep.
154,Rachel,"Ross, hi, it's Rachel."
155,Rachel,"I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael."
156,Rachel,"And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you."
157,Rachel,"I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure."
158,Rachel,COMMERCIAL BREAK
159,Chandler,"No, no, no, no, no, no  No."
160,Chandler,"Monica, it's Sunday morning."

176,Ross,"Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say."
177,Ross,What?
178,Ross,"Why, why are you looking at me like that?"
179,Rachel,"I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember."
180,Ross,"OK. Oh, oh, oh."
181,Rachel,Did we speak on the phone last night?
182,Rachel,Did you call me?
183,Ross,"No, I stayed at Julie's last night."
184,Rachel,Huh.
185,Ross,"Oh, actually I haven't even been home yet."
186,Ross,Do you mind if I check my messages?
187,Rachel,"Oh yeah, go ahead."
188,Ross,"Rach, I got a message from you."

199,Ross,What?
200,Rachel,"Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you."
201,Ross,You've had feelings for me?
202,Rachel,"Yeah, what, so?"
203,Rachel,You had feelings for me first.
204,Ross,Woah.
205,Ross,Huh.
206,Ross,"You know about my, I mean, you know I had... you know?"
207,Rachel,Chandler told me.
208,Ross,Chandler.
209,Ross,When did he... when did he... when did he?
210,Rachel,When you were in China.
211,Ross,China.
212,Rachel,Meeting Julie.
213,Ross,Julie.
214,Ross,Julie.
215,Ross,That.
216,Ross,Oh God.
217,Ross,"Julie, right."
218,Ross,"OK, I need to lie down."
219,Ross,"No, ya know, I'm gonna stand."
220,Ross,"I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing."
221,Ross,"OK so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you're over me?"
222,Rachel,Are you over me?
223,Ross,"That's, that's Julie."
224,Ross,"Ju... Julie, Julie."
225,Ross,Hi Julie.
226,Ross,I'll be right down.
227,Rachel,"Wait, so, you're going?"
228,Ross,"Well, OK, I uh, I have to."
229,Ross,I can't deal with this right now.
230,Ross,"I mean, I've uh, y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm..."
231,Ross,I'm gonna go get a cat.
232,Rachel,"OK, OK."
233,Ross,Cat.
234,Phoebe,Hey Joey.
235,Joey,Hey Phoebs.
236,Phoebe,How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
237,Joey,I can't find the remote.
238,Joey,Thank you.
239,Phoebe,"So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did."
240,Joey,And?
241,Phoebe,And we did.
242,Joey,"All right Phoebs, way to go."
243,Phoebe,Yay me.
244,Joey,"So, so how did it happen?"
245,Phoebe,"Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on."
246,Joey,And what did he say?
247,Phoebe,"He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la."
248,Phoebe,So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.
249,Joey,Wow.
250,Phoebe,"Yeah, so I said, ""OK, relax please,"" y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too."
251,Phoebe,So after a looooot of talking.
252,Phoebe,I convinced him.
253,Joey,Let me get this straight.
254,Joey,"He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea."
255,Phoebe,Um-hum.
256,Joey,This man is my God.
257,Rachel,Hi.
258,Ross,I didn't get a cat.
259,Rachel,"Oh, that's um, interesting."
260,Ross,"No, no it's not interesting."
261,Ross,"OK, it's very, very not interesting."
262,Ross,In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.
263,Rachel,"Alright, I got it Ross."
264,Ross,You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
265,Rachel,What?
266,Ross,I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
267,Rachel,"Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you."
268,Rachel,You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
269,Ross,Then you should have said something before I met her.
270,Rachel,I didn't know then.
271,Rachel,And how come you never said anything to me.
272,Ross,There was never a good time.
273,Rachel,"Right, you, you only had a year."
274,Rachel,We only hung out every night.
275,Ross,"Not, not, not every night."
276,Ross,"You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know?"
277,Ross,"Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys."
278,Rachel,"Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?"
279,Ross,The point is I...
280,Ross,"I don't need this right now, OK."
281,Ross,"It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy."
282,Ross,This ship has sailed.
283,Rachel,"Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?"
284,Ross,"Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it."
285,Rachel,"Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross."
286,Ross,Fine.
287,Rachel,'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
288,Ross,Good.
289,Rachel,Good.
290,Rachel,"And ya know what, now I've got closure."
291,Ross,Try the bottom one.
292,Chandler,"Monica, it's"
293,Monica,"No way, with one pound to go, c'mon."
294,Monica,"We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'."
295,Chandler,"OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound."
296,Chandler,"OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound."
297,Chandler,"OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret."
298,Monica,"Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh?"
299,Monica,What?
300,Chandler,"Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have."
301,Monica,"Well, thanks."
302,Chandler,"I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work."
303,Monica,"Well, you know."
304,Chandler,"You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed."
305,Monica,Uh-huh.
306,Chandler,And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
307,Monica,"Well no, but um."
308,Chandler,"I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all."
309,Monica,"Y'know, I try to stay positive."
310,Chandler,"So, you feel like goin' for a run?"
311,Monica,Alright.
312,Chandler,"Because, you know, you don't have to."
313,Chandler,"If you want, you could just take a nap right here."
314,Monica,OK. Just for a little while.
315,Chandler,OK.  END
0,Chandler,Hey!
1,Ross,Yeah!
2,Ross,Yeah!
3,Ross,OK!
4,Ross,Sure!
5,Ross,Look!
6,Ross,Can we...can we talk about what  happened here last night?
7,Chandler,Sure!
8,Chandler,Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like  you!
9,Chandler,Do you believe that who everdid something over here last night did what  they did or didn't do ...I mean come on!
10,Ross,OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?
11,Chandler,No!
12,Ross,OK!
13,Ross,Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from  her office out on your balcony.
14,Chandler,Our balcony?
15,Chandler,Seriously?
16,Chandler,That's so funny because I told Monica  we should put lights on our balcony.
17,Chandler,"And she said""No, no."
18,Chandler,"It's too cold,  nobody will go out there."""
19,Chandler,"And I said ""Maybe if we put some light out there they  will"""
20,Ross,Right that's why I came over to talk about.
21,Ross,"Hum...I saw Rachel  kissing some guy on your balcony,even though there were NO LIGHTS !"
22,Chandler,So are you gonna...talk to her?
23,Ross,Why...Why should I?
24,Ross,"I mean if she wants to move on, that's  fine!"
25,Chandler,"You know when ""That's fine"" sounds true when someone yells it  and spits!"
26,Ross,No I'm serious.
27,Ross,I mean she wants to date people?
28,Ross,Fine!
29,Ross,I don't care  but...at least she could have told me.
30,Ross,"You knowI...I've been putting my life  on hold and just concentrating on Emma but if she wants to go out there kissing  guys shebarely knows, then so will I !"
31,Ross,Very funny!
32,Ross,Ross is gay!
33,Ross,Ah!
34,Ross,Ah!
35,Chandler,No no no.
36,Chandler,Good.
37,Chandler,So you're moving on?
38,Chandler,Do you have any idea where  you're moving?
39,Ross,I don't know.
40,Ross,I mean I have plenty of opportunity.
41,Ross,"Just just now  there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.And then the other  day on the subway a woman ""accidentally"" sat on my hand."
42,Chandler,"Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!"
43,Ross,"Well, and how about this?"
44,Ross,There is an anthropologist at school who  totally came on to me during the inter-departmentalPotluck dinner.
45,Chandler,Why did I get married?
46,Joey,Hey!
47,Joey,Let me ask you guys something.
48,Joey,I have a new headshot taken  tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks Ishould have my eyebrows  waxed.
49,Joey,Is that weird for a guy?
50,Phoebe,Well it depends.
51,Joey,On...?
52,Phoebe,On how far along he's in the sex change process!
53,Monica,No I totally disagree.
54,Monica,No I think it's fine for a guy to do  something like that.
55,Monica,Such you an actor.
56,Monica,"Not that you need to,your eyebrows  are..."
57,Joey,Ok!
58,Joey,Stop it you guys!
59,Joey,Stop staring!
60,Joey,You're freaking me out!
61,Phoebe,Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...
62,Joey,Oh man!
63,Joey,I have to get those done too?
64,Phoebe,Wow!
65,Phoebe,Talking about high maintenance
66,Joey,Hey hey!
67,Joey,You dye your hair!
68,Phoebe,I'm a woman!
69,Joey,Arghhh!
70,Joey,Double standards!
71,Phoebe,"Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar  tonight?"
72,Monica,Only if I don't have to get up and sing.
73,Phoebe,But everybody sings.
74,Phoebe,It's so much fun!
75,Phoebe,"Last time this adorable  old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped outand everyone  booed him off the stage."
76,Phoebe,So funny.
77,Monica,"It's just, I'm not good at singing."
78,Phoebe,Oh!
79,Phoebe,What's the matter?
80,Phoebe,Are you scared?
81,Phoebe,You're afraid I'm a better  singer?
82,Phoebe,You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?
83,Monica,"No no, it's not working on me."
84,Monica,Wow!
85,Monica,I must be growing up!
86,Phoebe,OK fine!
87,Phoebe,Please come and support Mike.
88,Phoebe,You don't have to  sing.
89,Monica,So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass  judgments on others?
90,Phoebe,While drinking...
91,Monica,I'm there!
92,Rachel,Hi guys!
93,Rachel,Listen I really need your help.
94,Rachel,I think I did something  really stupid.
95,Phoebe,Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out  there
96,Rachel,No not that.
97,Rachel,I kissed Gavin last night.
98,Phoebe,Oh my god.
99,Monica,You kissed him?
100,Rachel,Yeah.
101,Rachel,"It was after the party, we were on the balcony  and..."
102,Monica,Wait wait wait.
103,Monica,I was at home the whole time.
104,Monica,How did I missed  that?
105,Phoebe,"It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping  paper."
106,Monica,Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?
107,Rachel,"You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me  and, oh and he gave me this scarf..."
108,Monica,I thought you hated him?
109,Rachel,"You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and  it turns out that line...is a scarf!"
110,Monica,So are you thinking of starting up something with this  guy?
111,Rachel,I don't know.
112,Rachel,It's so complicated.
113,Rachel,"I work with this guy, you  know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don'tknow what to do  and I have to be at the office and see Gavin in ten minutes."
114,Monica,"Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin,  and you definitely should talk to Ross"
115,Rachel,Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...
116,Phoebe,Wow!
117,Phoebe,"Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss  a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!"
118,Joey,Hey.
119,Joey,I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
120,Joey,Salon
121,Joey,Chandler Bing.

136,Joey,How Hoooow!
137,Chandler,Hey it's the most eligible man in NY.
138,Chandler,How's the moving on  going?
139,Ross,Not well.
140,Ross,I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand  but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
141,Chandler,Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way.
142,Chandler,You know I  mean think about it.

146,Chandler,What are doing?
147,Chandler,You know I can only dish it out!
148,Ross,I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to  me
149,Chandler,"Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just  an impulsive one-time birthday thing"
150,Ross,"No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a  bar."
151,Chandler,Did she go out with him?
152,Ross,No.
153,Ross,"When he called, I...I threw the message away."

164,Ross,"You...you break theice with some kind of  jokes so that they know you're the funny one and I swoop in with some  interesting conversation, sothey'll see that I'm the brilliant, brooding,  sexy one..."

212,Rachel,He's just being silly.Gavin come out from behind  that curtain!
213,Rachel,OK.
214,Rachel,I thought it was Ross.
215,Rachel,There isn't.
216,Rachel,There is totally isn't.
217,Rachel,All right.
218,Rachel,Look.
219,Rachel,"Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were  here, which I shouldn't."
220,Rachel,"You know Ross and I are not inany relationship  but...he is the father of my child, and you know we do live together and plus  there is just so muchhistory...you know it's just...I don't know, I'm sorry,  I'm just all over the place."
221,Rachel,Yes
222,Rachel,People keep saying that.
223,Rachel,Oh I'm sorry Gavin
224,Rachel,So seriously...rodeo clown?
225,Phoebe,"""No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the  world...!"""
226,Phoebe,Thank you!
227,Phoebe,Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing.
228,Monica,No I told you I can't.
229,Phoebe,But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice  voice.
230,Monica,What have you heard me sing?
231,Phoebe,All the time when you're cooking.
232,Monica,What?
233,Phoebe,"Yeah you're always singing ""Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in  my tummy"""
234,Monica,Yeah I do rock that one.
235,Phoebe,OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up  there?
236,Monica,Just a little but...it's just so scary!
237,Monica,I don't even know what I  would sing...
238,Monica,"""Delta Dawn"""
239,Ross,Hi!
240,Ross,"I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace"
241,Ross,"Right, so that's a firm ""no""."
242,Ross,"I cannot believe this, I just keep  striking out."
243,Chandler,"I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate,  you're asking women how they want to be killed"
244,Ross,This is great.
245,Ross,Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the  one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.
246,Chandler,By drowning or...?
247,Chandler,Well...
248,Ross,I know!
249,Monica,Wait wait!
250,Monica,I can't sing in front of all these people.
251,Phoebe,Just pretend they're not even here!
252,Phoebe,"It's OK Monica, when that  spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyoneanyway."
253,Monica,Hi!
254,Monica,"I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing ""Delta Dawn""""Delta  Dawn, what's that flower you have on?"
255,Monica,Could it be a faded rose from days gone  by?
256,Monica,"..."""
257,Phoebe,Can you totally see through her shirt ?
258,Monica,"""To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"""
259,Joey,"Hey, I need your help."
260,Chandler,"Wow, it seems serious."
261,Chandler,"What seems to be the problem, Ashley  Judd?"
262,Joey,"Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my  eyebrows shaped"
263,Chandler,"I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!"
264,Joey,You may be a sissy but I'll still .
265,Joey,"All  right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do oneeyebrow and now... they  don't match!"
266,Chandler,It's like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
267,Joey,"All right, look, you got to help me out, ok?"
268,Joey,"Look, I have the magic  marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one soI don't look stupid for my  pictures."
269,Chandler,"Ok. First of all, this is green!"
270,Joey,What the hell am I supposed to do!
271,Chandler,"All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you  will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you."
272,Joey,"What, what."
273,Chandler,"Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the  lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mineby plucking the eyebrows  of my father and his business partners."
274,Joey,Oh my God!
275,Chandler,"Yeah, well, I guess you don't need my help Victor  Victoria!"
276,Joey,"Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help,  but Chandler I don't know if I can take anymoreplucking."
277,Joey,It hurts so  bad!
278,Chandler,"Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my  gentle self-loathing touch."
279,Monica,"""Take me to the mansion in the sky-y""."
280,Monica,"I am sorry, the song is  over."
281,Monica,Did you see me out there?
282,Phoebe,Every little bit of you!
283,Monica,I can't believe I did this.
284,Monica,"I can't believe I'm singing for the  people, and they liked me!"
285,Monica,"Hey, did you hear thatone shouting look at those  tips!"
286,Monica,"I mean, did I really help you get a lot of tips?"
287,Phoebe,"Mon', not that you didn't sound good, but..."
288,Monica,Good?
289,Monica,Didn't you hear them...I was great!
290,Monica,Thank you so much for  making me do this.
291,Monica,That's is the best gift ever.
292,Ross,"But, what's great is that you don't mind talking about it."
293,Ross,Uh-ah!
294,Ross,Good choice Ross.
295,Rachel,"Oh, hey!"
296,Rachel,"Hi, there you are, I've been looking for you  everywhere!"
297,Ross,"Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am."
298,Rachel,"Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o' clock."
299,Rachel,So I was hoping you and I could have achance to kind of talk somebody  here?
300,Ross,"Oh, yeah, yeah that's Michelle."
301,Rachel,Who?
302,Ross,"Oh, just this woman I've been seeing."
303,Rachel,You've being seeing someone?
304,Ross,"Yeah, didn't I mention that?"
305,Ross,"Yeah, I mean, we haven't being going  out for too long, but rather there is thisamazing connection between us."
306,Ross,"I-I  mean, in fact just before you came in she called me her boyfriend."
307,Ross,"I thought it  wasa little too soon, but it was also, you know, it was kinda nice."
308,Ross,How great is this?
309,Ross,You are already comfortable enough to look  through my stuff.
310,Ross,"Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that'smy roommate, Rachel."
311,Rachel,"Hi, and I am also Emma's mother."
312,Ross,I told you about my daughter.
313,Chandler,And done!
314,Joey,Oh my God!
315,Joey,I didn't feel a thing !
316,Joey,"Hey, are you still looking for a  job because you can tweeze circles aroundthat sadistic bitch at the  saloon"
317,Chandler,Thanks.
318,Chandler,You wanna see what it looks like?
319,Joey,"Yeah, yeah."
320,Joey,"Hey, they totally match!"
321,Joey,They look great!
322,Joey,They look  great!
323,Joey,How you doing!
324,Chandler,"Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good."
325,Chandler,"I was a little  worried I was uncovering a birthmark right aboutthere, but it turned out to  be a little piece of chocolate."
326,Joey,Thank you so much.
327,Chandler,No problem.
328,Joey,"Listen that's a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some  manly make up for it."
329,Chandler,Yeah.
330,Joey,Comb my eyelashes.
331,Monica,"Ok, for my next song I think I'll sing something a little more  upbeat."
332,Monica,All right?
333,Monica,"Oh, how about the PointerSisters I am so excited."
334,Monica,And  make it bouncy!
335,Phoebe,Oh you'll probably take care of that on your hands.
336,Chandler,I am sorry I am late.
337,Chandler,You'll understand when you'll see  Joey.
338,Monica,"Honey, you're just in time, I'm about to sing another  song!"
339,Chandler,Really?
340,Chandler,In front of all this people?
341,Monica,And they love me!
342,Chandler,Oh my God!
343,Phoebe,"Yes, she gives the people what they want."
344,Monica,"All right, watch!"
345,Monica,"""Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll  put all other things aside."
346,Monica,"Give in thistime and show me some  affection..."""
347,Chandler,Are those my wife's nipples?
348,Phoebe,Oh?
349,Phoebe,Isn't that funny?
350,Phoebe,"I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have  let her go up again."
351,Chandler,I gotta stop this.
352,Monica,"Oh, who cares, they still love me!"
353,Monica,"""I am so excited..."""
354,Chandler,"You, touching yourself, out!"
355,Rachel,Wow.
356,Rachel,She does that a lot!
357,Rachel,"What, what, wait a minute!"
358,Rachel,"You haven't even told her you were a  doctor, yet?"
359,Rachel,"How long have you known her, likean hour?"
360,Ross,"I told you it wasn't long, but there is an amazing connection  between us."
361,Ross,Are you kidding?
362,Ross,We'll see.
363,Rachel,"Ok, Ross, what's going on here, are we just bringing strange  women back to the apartment now?"
364,Ross,"I don't know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?"
365,Rachel,How do you know about that?
366,Ross,Through the magic of sight!
367,Ross,"I was here, putting our child to  sleep..."
368,Ross,"When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a  guy you know, for what?"
369,Ross,A week?
370,Rachel,"Oh, that's what this is all about?"
371,Rachel,Did you bring her up here to  get back at me?
372,Ross,"Ok, Michelle, it's time to go."
373,Ross,Ok.
374,Ross,"You know, if it's meant to be, I'll guess it."
375,Ross,"Bye, bye."
376,Rachel,Score.
377,Ross,"Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we  could come to one of your kissing parties onthe balcony."
378,Rachel,"Oh God, I can't believe you're making such a big deal about this."
379,Rachel,"It was one kiss, one guy, one time!"
380,Ross,"Oh, really!"
381,Rachel,Yeah.
382,Ross,"Oh, really!"
383,Rachel,Oh yeah.
384,Ross,What about the guy from the bar?
385,Rachel,What?
386,Rachel,Who?
387,Ross,The guy you gave your number to.
388,Rachel,"Whoa, how do you know about that?"
389,Ross,Because he called here looking for you.
390,Ross,"So don't tell me  this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,ok?"
391,Ross,You've been  out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now.
392,Ross,And you didn't even  have the courtesy to tell me.
393,Rachel,Why didn't I get that message?
394,Ross,What?
395,Rachel,"From the guy in the bar, why didn't I get that message?"
396,Ross,Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket.
397,Ross,Do you...do you  not look there?
398,Rachel,Ross?
399,Ross,I never gave it to you.
400,Rachel,Why?
401,Ross,I don't know.
402,Rachel,Oh God.
403,Rachel,You know what?
404,Rachel,Who you think you are?
405,Rachel,Who are you to  decide what messages I should or should not get?
406,Ross,Who am I?
407,Rachel,Yes.
408,Ross,I am the guy who's taking care of our baby while you're out at bars  meeting guys!
409,Rachel,"Oh my God, I cannot believe this."
410,Rachel,You know I actually came in  here hoping to have a mature conversation with youAbout us!
411,Rachel,But I can't do  that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my  apartment!
412,Ross,None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me!
413,Ross,That's not the  point.
414,Ross,Ok?
415,Ross,The point is you...you are the oneWho moved on and didn't tell  anyone!
416,Rachel,"Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up!"
417,Rachel,What's wrong with us?
418,Rachel,"You  know when people hear about our situation theyAlways ask, what, you live  together but you're not a couple?"
419,Rachel,"And you have a baby, isn't that weird?» And I  say No.You know what, it's not, because it works for us!» But you know this  doesn't work."
420,Rachel,In fact this is the opposite of working!
421,Ross,"Uh, clearly."
422,Rachel,"And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as  long as this makes sense."
423,Rachel,"An maybe this, you know,Just doesn't make sense  anymore."
424,Ross,"Yeah, maybe not."
425,Ross,So what you wanna do?
426,Joey,Hey!
427,Rachel,Hi.
428,Rachel,Can Emma and I live here for a while?
429,Joey,"Ha, oh, of course."
430,Rachel,Thank you.
431,Joey,Your eyebrows look weird.
432,Chandler,Jeremiah was a bullfrog.
433,Chandler,"Was a good friend of mine, never  understood a single word he said, but I helped himdrink his wine. So you  just touch yourself for anything?"
434,Chandler,END
0,Monica,Hi!
1,Chandler,Hi!
2,Joey,Monica?
3,Joey,What time is it?
4,Chandler,"Uhh, 9."
5,Joey,But it's dark out.
6,Monica,"Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly!"
7,Monica,This is what 9 looks like.
8,Joey,I guess I'll get washed up then.
9,Joey,Watch that sunrise.
10,Monica,I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
11,Chandler,"I know, me too."
12,Chandler,Hey!
13,Chandler,Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend?
14,Chandler,Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
15,Monica,All weekend?
16,Monica,That's a whole lotta naked.
17,Chandler,"Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing."
18,Monica,"Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!"
19,Chandler,"Okay, y'know your not though."
20,Chandler,Let's go.
21,Monica,Wait!
22,Monica,What about Joey?
23,Monica,Opening Credits
24,Monica,"Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend!"
25,Monica,I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.
26,Phoebe,"Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!"
27,Monica,"Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont."
28,Chandler,I'm not in charge of where the conference is held.
29,Chandler,Do you want people to think it's a fake conference?
30,Chandler,It's a real conference.
31,Ross,Hey.
32,Joey,Hey!
33,Monica,Hey.
34,Ross,Is Rachel here?
35,Ross,I gotta talk to her.
36,Monica,"No, she's out shopping."
37,Ross,Damn!
38,Chandler,What's going on?
39,Ross,I told Emily to come.
40,Ross,"And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it."
41,Phoebe,Wait a minute!
42,Phoebe,"So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?"
43,Ross,"Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the ""I get to see my wife,"" part, all right?"
44,Ross,And not the part that makes me do this.
45,Monica,"Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together?"
46,Monica,How is that even gonna work?
47,Ross,I have no idea.
48,Ross,I mean But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
49,Joey,"Doesn't seem like it's going to work, I mean"
50,Rachel,"Hi, guys!"
51,Joey,Hi!
52,Chandler,"Uh, hey!"
53,Rachel,What's going on?
54,Chandler,We're flipping Monica's mattress.
55,Joey,"So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it."
56,Phoebe,Yeah that's better than my way.
57,Rachel,"Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?"
58,Chandler,"Aww, man!"
59,Rachel,Oh look!
60,Rachel,A letter from my mom.
61,Ross,"So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?"
62,Rachel,Oh yeah!
63,Rachel,I know.
64,Phoebe,Can you hear anything?
65,Chandler,"Oh yes, somebody just said, ""Can you hear anything?"""
66,Monica,"Hey, Joey's ass!"
67,Monica,What are you doing?
68,Joey,"Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything?"
69,Joey,"Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here."
70,Monica,"Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles"
71,Phoebe,"Ooh, Madlibs, mine!"
72,Chandler,Condoms?
73,Joey,You don't know how long we're gonna be in here!
74,Joey,We may have to repopulate the Earth.
75,Chandler,And condoms are the way to do that?
76,Ross,"Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily"
77,Rachel,Oh my God!
78,Rachel,My dog died!
79,Ross,What?
80,Rachel,"Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!"
81,Ross,Le Poo's still alive?
82,Rachel,"Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks."
83,Rachel,Oh.
84,Rachel,Oh my God.
85,Monica,"Sweetie, we heard you crying."
86,Monica,Please don't cry.
87,Rachel,It's Le Poo.
88,Phoebe,"I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better."
89,Chandler,I can't believe it!
90,Chandler,We're here!
91,Monica,"Ooh, chocolates on the pillows!"
92,Monica,I love that!
93,Chandler,"Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere."
94,Monica,Come here.
95,Monica,"Okay, be right back."
96,Chandler,Oh yes!
97,Chandler,"Monica, get in here!"
98,Chandler,There's a high-speed car chase on!
99,Monica,We're switching rooms.
100,Chandler,"Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!"
101,Monica,"No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them!"
102,Monica,"I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change."
103,Monica,"Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?"
104,Chandler,"Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!"
105,Ross,"Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?"
106,Rachel,Oh yeah!
107,Ross,"Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily."
108,Ross,"Well, there's this one thing Okay,  here goes."
109,Ross,I made a promise that--Oh hey!
110,Rachel,What?
111,Ross,You're nose is bleeding!
112,Rachel,Oh God.
113,Rachel,No!
114,Rachel,Oh not again!
115,Rachel,This-this happened when my grandfather died.
116,Rachel,It's ugh!
117,Rachel,Sorry.
118,Rachel,"Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?"
119,Ross,Umm
120,Rachel,Sorry.
121,Rachel,Sorry.
122,Ross,"Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore."
123,Rachel,"Yeah, I know."
124,Rachel,It's ridiculous!
125,Rachel,I can't see you either.
126,Chandler,"Okay, great."
127,Chandler,Hotel
128,Chandler,Half a tank?
129,Chandler,We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
130,Monica,We're switching rooms again.
131,Chandler,What?
132,Chandler,Why?
133,Monica,"This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room."
134,Monica,Hotel
135,Monica,"Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?"
136,Chandler,Uh-huh.
137,Monica,Chandler!
138,Chandler,Yeah.
139,Monica,"Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em!"
140,Monica,And we're not a couple of suckers!
141,Chandler,"I hear ya, Mugsy!"
142,Chandler,"But look, all these rooms are fine okay?"
143,Chandler,"Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you."
144,Monica,"Okay, this one I like!"
145,Chandler,Nothing!
146,Chandler,It's over!
147,Chandler,Dammit!
148,Chandler,This is regularly scheduled programming!
149,Monica,Can we turn the TV off?
150,Monica,Okay?
151,Monica,Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
152,Chandler,"Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?"
153,Monica,"Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!"
154,Chandler,"Oh, who should I blame?"
155,Chandler,The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
156,Monica,"I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!"
157,Chandler,Do not speak ill of the dead.
158,Monica,"We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?"
159,Chandler,I just want to watch a little television.
160,Chandler,What is the big deal?
161,Chandler,"Geez, relax mom."
162,Monica,What did you say?
163,Chandler,"I said, ""Geez, relax Monnnnn."""
164,Rachel,Hi!
165,Ross,Hey.
166,Ross,"Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out."
167,Rachel,"Okay, what's up?"
168,Ross,"Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?"
169,Rachel,"Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants."
170,Ross,"And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants"
171,Rachel,Yeah?
172,Ross,is for me not to see you anymore.
173,Rachel,That's crazy!
174,Rachel,You can't do that!
175,Rachel,What are you going to tell her?
176,Rachel,Oh God.
177,Rachel,"Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?"
178,Ross,"It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work."
179,Ross,"And I do, I have to make this marriage work."
180,Ross,I have too.
181,Ross,But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
182,Rachel,Ohh!
183,Rachel,Lucky me!
184,Rachel,Oh my God!
185,Rachel,"That is good news, Ross!"
186,Rachel,I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!
187,Ross,You have no idea what a nightmare this has been.
188,Ross,This is so hard.
189,Rachel,"Oh yeah, really?"
190,Rachel,Is it Ross?
191,Rachel,Yeah?
192,Rachel,"Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you."
193,Ross,What are you doing?
194,Rachel,Storming out!
195,Ross,"Rachel, this is your apartment."
196,Rachel,"Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!"
197,Rachel,Commercial Break
198,Chandler,Damn Rollos!
199,Joey,"Hey, you're back!"
200,Chandler,Hey.
201,Joey,How was your conference?
202,Chandler,It was terrible.
203,Chandler,"I fought with  my colleagues y'know, the entire time."
204,Chandler,Are you kidding with this?
205,Joey,"Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?"
206,Chandler,"Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator."
207,Monica,Hi!
208,Joey,"Hey, you're back too!"
209,Monica,Yeah.
210,Monica,"Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?"
211,Joey,"Hey, how was your chef thing?"
212,Monica,"Oh, it was awful."
213,Monica,I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
214,Chandler,"Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea."
215,Monica,Chandler!
216,Chandler,Monica.
217,Monica,"Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half."
218,Chandler,"Okay, fine, $300."
219,Monica,300 dollars?
220,Chandler,"Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!"
221,Monica,Urghh!
222,Joey,What are you guys woofing about?
223,Monica,Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
224,Joey,Nooooo!!!
225,Joey,Y'know what?
226,Joey,"Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!"
227,Ross,You should've seen the look on her face.
228,Ross,I don't want Rachel to hate me!
229,Ross,I don't know what to do.
230,Joey,You want my advice?
231,Ross,Yes!
232,Ross,Please!
233,Joey,You're not gonna like it.
234,Ross,That's okay.
235,Joey,You got married to fast.
236,Ross,That's not advice!
237,Joey,I told ya.
238,Ross,I'm going to the bathroom.
239,Joey,"Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it."
240,Joey,Chandler and
241,Phoebe,"Yeah, me either."
242,Monica,Maybe I could do it.
243,Rachel,Hi!
244,Joey,"Hi, Rach."
245,Chandler,Hi!
246,Phoebe,Hey.
247,Monica,Hey.
248,Rachel,"Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it."
249,Rachel,All right?
250,Joey,"I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there."
251,Rachel,That's not Ross!
252,Phoebe,Oh no!
253,Phoebe,Not that guy!
254,Phoebe,He does look like him though.
255,Chandler,"Okay, Ross is in the bathroom."
256,Rachel,"Oh my God, its happening."
257,Rachel,It's already started.
258,Rachel,I'm Kip.
259,Joey,"Hey, you're not Kip!"
260,Rachel,Do you even know who Kip is?
261,Joey,Who cares?
262,Joey,You're Rachel!
263,Joey,Who's Kip?
264,Chandler,"Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together."
265,Joey,"Oh, that poor bastard."
266,Rachel,See?
267,Rachel,"Yeah, you told me the story."
268,Rachel,He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened?
269,Rachel,He got phased out!
270,Monica,You're not gonna be phased out!
271,Rachel,"Well, of course I am!"
272,Rachel,It's not gonna happen to Ross!
273,Rachel,He's your brother.
274,Rachel,He's your old college roommate.
275,Rachel,"Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group."
276,Rachel,I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
277,Phoebe,Ehh!
278,Rachel,"Honey, come on!"
279,Rachel,You live far away!
280,Rachel,You're not related.
281,Rachel,You lift right out.
282,Chandler,Hey!
283,Joey,"Hey, Mr. Bing."
284,Joey,"That uh, hotel you stayed at called."
285,Joey,Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
286,Chandler,Yes that was mine.
287,Joey,'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
288,Chandler,Yes that would have made more sense.
289,Joey,"Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man!"
290,Joey,"All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time."
291,Joey,"And whatever you say, I'll believe ya."
292,Joey,"Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?"
293,Rachel,Phoebe?
294,Rachel,I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing.
295,Rachel,You gotta come with me!
296,Phoebe,Come where?
297,Rachel,Wherever I go.
298,Rachel,"Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones."
299,Phoebe,"Okay, but try and get Joey too."
300,Ross,"Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?"
301,Phoebe,"Oh, sure!"
302,Phoebe,Bye Ross!
303,Phoebe,Forever.
304,Ross,Hi.
305,Rachel,Hi.
306,Rachel,What are you doing here?
307,Rachel,Isn't this against the rules?
308,Ross,"I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice."
309,Ross,"I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back."
310,Rachel,"Oh, Ross"
311,Ross,"No, no, it's okay."
312,Ross,Really.
313,Ross,They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King.
314,Ross,"So is, is that better?"
315,Rachel,"No, it's not better."
316,Rachel,I still don't get to see you.
317,Ross,"Well, what-what would you do?"
318,Ross,"Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?"
319,Rachel,"Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!"
320,Ross,I can't believe this is happening.
321,Rachel,I know.
322,Ross,I am so sorry.
323,Rachel,I know that too.
324,Joey,"Hey, Rach?"
325,Joey,"Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something."

330,Monica,"Yeah, it did."
331,Chandler,"So, I guess this is over."
332,Monica,What?
333,Chandler,"Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime."
334,Monica,"Why, exactly?"
335,Chandler,"Because of the weekend, we had a fight."
336,Monica,Chandler that's crazy!
337,Monica,If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer thanOhhh!
338,Chandler,"So, this isn't over?"
339,Monica,You are so cute!
340,Monica,No.
341,Monica,"No, it was a fight."

372,Joey,How?!
373,Joey,When?
374,Chandler,It happened in London.
375,Joey,IN LONDON!!
376,Chandler,The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
377,Joey,But it is a big deal!!
378,Joey,I have to tell someone!
379,Chandler,No-no-no-no-no!
380,Chandler,You can't!

396,Monica,Oh that's cute!
397,Monica,We really all enjoyed it.
398,Monica,"But y'know, it doesn't count."
399,Phoebe,Count for what?
400,Monica,Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
401,Joey,I guess I'm done.
402,Chandler,Fun's over!
403,Monica,"Wait-wait, guys!"
404,Monica,"If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!"
405,Rachel,Uh-huh!
406,Joey,I think I'm gonna take-off.

6,Joey,Is this porn?
7,Joey,What did I do?
8,Joey,I must've hit something on the remote.
9,Chandler,Do we pay for this?
10,Joey,"No, we didn't even pay our cable billmaybe this is how they punish us."
11,Chandler,Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone billfree phone sex.
12,Joey,Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill?
13,Joey,Mr.
14,Chandler,"Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!"

26,Chandler,And no one touches the air around the TV!
27,Joey,"Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?"

66,Ross,Why do we have to talk about the future?
67,Ross,"Let's just enjoy"""
68,Monica,"No-no-no, don't-don't do the accent."
69,Monica,You've got to see her again.
70,Ross,And why do you care so much?
71,Monica,Because!
72,Monica,You could get to live out my fantasy!
73,Ross,You had fantasies about Emily?
74,Monica,No!
75,Monica,"Y'know, the fantasy!"
76,Monica,"Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together."
77,Ross,Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
78,Monica,"Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!"
79,Ross,Ahh.
80,Monica,Do you love her?
81,Ross,"We said it was only going to be two weeks, y'know?"
82,Monica,You love her!
83,Ross,What-what is love really?
84,Monica,"Ohhh, I knew you loved her!"
85,Monica,Then you need to go to the airport and tell her.
86,Monica,You're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate.
87,Monica,"You're gonna call out her name and say, ""I love you!"""
88,Monica,"And she's gonna say, ""I love you, too!"""
89,Monica,"And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud."
90,Ross,I am a good kisser.
91,Monica,"Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in  I've been watching too much porn."
92,Rachel,Is that the heartbeat?

119,Phoebe,"Oh God, I'm so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked."
120,Phoebe,"No, no maybe cause it's harder to raise them, and the added expense, and"
121,Phoebe,"No, back to happy."
122,Phoebe,Back to happy!

139,Rachel,What's that song?
140,Rachel,It has been in my head all day long.
141,Chandler,It's the theme from Good Will Humping.
142,Rachel,Y'know who doesn't even like dirty movies?
143,Rachel,My new boyfriend Joshua.
144,Joey,Yeah right.
145,Rachel,"No, he told me."
146,Rachel,He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
147,Chandler,"Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?"
148,Rachel,Yes!
149,Joey,"Yeah, he likes porn."
150,Monica,Where ya going?
151,Rachel,I'm going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny.
152,Rachel,"Hey, Pheebs!"
153,Phoebe,Hey.
154,Joey,Hey!
155,Monica,How did it go with Frank and Alice?
156,Phoebe,"Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies!"
157,Phoebe,"I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you  about, cause you work for a big company."
158,Phoebe,"Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me."
159,Chandler,They don't really talk to us about that kind of stuff.
160,Chandler,I can get you some free white out though.
161,Monica,Ohh!
162,Monica,Did you do what I said?
163,Monica,Did-did-did you tell her?
164,Ross,I did.
165,Monica,"And well, what did she say?"
166,Ross,Thank you.
167,Monica,"Oh, you're totally welcome!"
168,Monica,What'd she say?
169,Ross,"She said, ""Thank you."""
170,Ross,"I said, ""I love you."""
171,Ross,"And she said, ""Thank you."""
172,Chandler,"Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?"
173,Joey,"Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?"
174,Ross,What do I do now?
175,Joey,You play hard to get.
176,Ross,She already lives in London.
177,Joey,Then you go to Tokyo.
178,Chandler,"All right look, forget it, forget it."
179,Chandler,"You told her you love her, it's over."
180,Monica,It is not over!
181,Monica,You're over!
182,Chandler,What?
183,Monica,You know!
184,Chandler,Okay.
185,Chandler,Good one.
186,Monica,It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you.
187,Monica,"And the reason why she couldn't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her."
188,Monica,"Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane!"
189,Monica,Come on now go!
190,Monica,Go!
191,Ross,Okay!
192,Ross,Okay!
193,Ross,"But if she doesn't call, it is definitely over!"
194,Ross,"No, wait."
195,Ross,Wait.
196,Ross,"Unless, eventually, I call her, y'know just to she what's going on, and, and she says she'll call me back, but then she doesn't."
197,Ross,Then it's over.
198,Joey,"Way to be strong, man!"
199,Rachel,Hey!
200,Chandler,Hi!
201,Chandler,"Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television?"
202,Chandler,We need a porn break.
203,Chandler,"We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again."
204,Rachel,"Well, so, why don't you just turn it off?"
205,Chandler,Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
206,Phoebe,"Ooh, good, you're hear!"
207,Phoebe,Okay.
208,Monica,Hey!
209,Phoebe,Hi!
210,Rachel,"Well, what-what cha got there?"
211,Phoebe,"Oh this, well I'm glad you asked."

216,Monica,"Phoebe, they didn't make you pay for those knives, did they?"
217,Phoebe,No!
218,Monica,Are you sure?
219,Phoebe,No!
220,Rachel,"Honey, you're not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives."
221,Phoebe,"No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan."
222,Chandler,What's the second part of your plan?
223,Phoebe,My Saturn dealership.
224,Ross,Hello?
225,Ross,"Emily, hi!"
226,Ross,"Uh, how-how was you flight?"
227,Ross,"No, no, that-that, that's all right."
228,Ross,"Umm, I'm just glad you called."
229,Ross,Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
230,Ross,"She doesn't know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy."
231,Monica,"This isn't how it's supposed to go, there can't be another guy."
232,Ross,Well
233,Monica,Of course there's another guy!!
234,Monica,This is even more perfect!
235,Monica,Now you have to prove your love!
236,Ross,I'm not proving anything.
237,Ross,"Okay, I'm done listening to you."
238,Ross,"If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would've put my fist through the wall!"
239,Chandler,You put your fist through the wall?
240,Ross,"No, I missed and hit the door."
241,Ross,"But, it opened really hard!"
242,Monica,You have to go to London!
243,Ross,What?
244,Monica,"Yeah, you have to go fight for her!"
245,Joey,"Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense."
246,Joey,Yeah.
247,Joey,"Cause you already told her you love her and she didn't say it back, then she called you and told you that there's another guy, so yeah, go to London that'll scare her!"
248,Monica,"When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?"
249,Ross,I made fun of his accent.
250,Monica,"You sat back and let him have her, you didn't fight at all."
251,Monica,Am I right?
252,Monica,Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
253,Ross,No.
254,Monica,"All right then, go fight for her!"
255,Monica,Go to London!
256,Monica,"I mean, that could be you and Emily!"
257,Monica,"That, but-but nicer."
258,Monica,"Just, go to London!"
259,Ross,Really?
260,Monica,Come on!
261,Monica,Surprise her!
262,Monica,Show up at her doorstep!
263,Monica,Don't let her go without a fight!
264,Ross,All right.
265,Ross,"All right, I'm gonna do it!"
266,Monica,All right.
267,Ross,"I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to London and I'm going to fight for her."
268,Monica,"Okay, good luck!"
269,Joey,Ross!
270,Joey,Ross!
271,Joey,"If you're going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars?"
272,Rachel,Hey!
273,Phoebe,Ooh-Ooh!
274,Phoebe,I did it!
275,Phoebe,I did it!
276,Phoebe,I figured out a way to make money!
277,Phoebe,I'm gonna open up my own massage place and Frank's gonna help me!
278,Phoebe,And!
279,Phoebe,We can work it around his schedule so he doesn't have to quit school!
280,Monica,"That's sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?"
281,Rachel,"Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised"
282,Phoebe,I'm telling it!
283,Phoebe,I'm telling it!
284,Rachel,Okay.
285,Phoebe,Okay.
286,Phoebe,"You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives!"
287,Phoebe,"I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I've got?"
288,Chandler,A place where no one will ever get out alive?
289,Phoebe,No!
290,Phoebe,"Think about it, it's a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it's"
291,Rachel,Relaxi-Taxi!
292,Phoebe,The name was my favourite part!
293,Rachel,"Well, well I can up with it!"
294,Phoebe,YOU DID NOT!!!!
295,Phoebe,Oh!
296,Phoebe,No!
297,Phoebe,You came up with Relaxi Cab!
298,Phoebe,That's not good.
299,Rachel,"Well, I"
300,Monica,Hello.
301,Ross,Hey.
302,Monica,Oh my God!
303,Monica,"Ross, are you in England?"
304,Monica,Was Emily surprised?
305,Ross,"No, because she hasn't come home yet."
306,Ross,And she hasn't been home all night!
307,Ross,"She's obviously staying with that other guy, and I'm the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!"
308,Monica,All right.
309,Monica,"When is, when is the next flight out?"
310,Ross,About four hours.
311,Monica,"Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn't show up by then, then just come on home."
312,Phoebe,"Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that's better than Relaxi Cab."
313,Rachel,"Okay, it's not Relaxi Cab."
314,Rachel,"It's Relaxicab, like taxicab."
315,Phoebe,"Oh, that is better."
316,Chandler,Are we in London?
317,Monica,What are you doing here?
318,Monica,You can't be here!
319,Joey,Nothing.
320,Joey,"No, nothing."
321,Monica,"Oh, you came to tell him you love him!"
322,Monica,I knew it!
323,Monica,I was right!
324,Monica,"I'm right, right?"
325,Monica,Oh.
326,Ross,I love you too!
327,Ross,"I'm, I'm gonna call you right now from the phone booth!"
328,Ross,You can't hear me.
329,Ross,Hi.
330,Ross,Ohh!
331,Ross,Thank you.
332,Ross,Closing Credits
333,Chandler,Hey.
334,Joey,Hey.
335,Chandler,"I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault."
336,Joey,Same kind of thing happened to me!
337,Joey,"Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!"
338,Chandler,"What, no, ""Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"""
339,Joey,Noo!
340,Joey,Nothing!
341,Chandler,"Y'know what, we have to turn off the porn."
342,Joey,I think you're right.
343,Chandler,"All right, ready?"
344,Joey,One.
345,Chandler,Two.
346,Joey,That's kinda nice.
347,Chandler,"Yeah, that's kinda a relief."

0,Monica,"What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it."
1,Joey,"Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?"
2,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah!"
3,Rachel,Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
4,Monica,Absolutely.
5,Chandler,"Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know?"
6,Chandler,I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
7,Ross,"Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket."
8,Chandler,"The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know?"
9,Chandler,"I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake."
10,Rachel,"Yeah, well, word of"
11,Joey,....Are we still talking about sex?
12,Joey,Opening Credits
13,Ross,"No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?"
14,Ross,Does she.
15,Ross,"Marsha, these are cave people."
16,Ross,Okay?
17,Ross,"They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.'"
18,Ross,See?
19,Ross,No.
20,Ross,No.
21,Ross,"Okay, okay, yes, it is."
22,Ross,"How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age."
23,Ross,You look great.
24,Ross,"I, uh..."
25,Ross,I hate that.
26,Ross,"Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect..."
27,Ross,So what's new?
28,Ross,"Still, uh..."
29,Ross,Well... you never know.
30,Ross,"How's, um.. how's the family?"
31,Ross,"Why- why are you here, Carol?"
32,Ross,Pregnant?
33,Chandler,"Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding."
34,Monica,Are you through with that?
35,Joey,"Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down."
36,Monica,Whose little ball of paper is this?
37,Chandler,"Oh, uh, that would be mine."
38,Chandler,"See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and...  ...now I wish I was dead."
39,Phoebe,"She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that-  -but, it's fine!"
40,Monica,"Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have."
41,Chandler,"Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow."
42,Phoebe,Monica- Hi!
43,Phoebe,"Um, Monica, you're scaring me."
44,Phoebe,"I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly."
45,Phoebe,And not-not in a good way.
46,Joey,"Yeah, calm down."
47,Joey,You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
48,Monica,"That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong."
49,Monica,"Y'see, he's the Prince."
50,Monica,Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
51,Chandler,"Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!"
52,Monica,What?
53,Chandler,Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
54,Rachel,Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
55,Phoebe,"Yeah, it's beautiful."
56,Rachel,"Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God...."
57,Phoebe,"No, look, don't touch that!"
58,Rachel,"Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry!"
59,Rachel,Remember me?
60,Rachel,I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!'
61,Rachel,"Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder..."
62,Monica,"Easy Rach, we'll find it."
63,Monica,Won't we!
64,Monica,Chandler and
65,Joey,Oh!
66,Joey,Yeah!
67,Joey,"Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?"
68,Phoebe,Doy!
69,Phoebe,Probably right before she lost it!
70,Chandler,You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
71,Rachel,"I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with..."
72,Chandler,...Dinah?
73,Rachel,"Ohhhhh, don't be mad..."
74,Monica,You didn't.
75,Rachel,"Oh, I am sorry..."
76,Monica,I gave you one job!
77,Rachel,"Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!"
78,Chandler,"Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne..."
79,Monica,I just... can't do it.
80,Chandler,Boys?
81,Chandler,We're going in.
82,Ross,.....Hi.
83,Monica,Wow.
84,Monica,That is not a happy hi.
85,Ross,Carol's pregnant.
86,Phoebe,Ooh!
87,Phoebe,I found it!
88,Monica,W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
89,Ross,Yeah.
90,Ross,"Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now."
91,Chandler,"Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?"
92,Rachel,"Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?"
93,Ross,"Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me."
94,Phoebe,She is so great!
95,Phoebe,I miss her.
96,Monica,What does she mean by 'involved'?
97,Chandler,"I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done."
98,Ross,"Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow."
99,Rachel,So what are you gonna do?
100,Ross,I have no idea.
101,Ross,"No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father."
102,Joey,".....Well, this is still ruined, right?"
103,Joey,Mrs.
104,Monica,Curry.
105,Monica,Mrs.
106,Ross,I- I think they're great!
107,Ross,"I, I really do."
108,Ross,Mr.
109,Ross,"Aw, Mom..."
110,Monica,"I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?"
111,Monica,Mrs.
112,Monica,"No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant."
113,Monica,Mrs.
114,Monica,"Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?"
115,Ross,Yeah.
116,Ross,Mrs.
117,Monica,"I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing?"
118,Monica,Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
119,Monica,Mrs.
120,Monica,What's that supposed to mean?
121,Monica,Mrs.
122,Monica,No it's not.
123,Monica,Mr.
124,Monica,"So, Ross, what's going on with you?"
125,Monica,Any stories?
126,Monica,"No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?"
127,Ross,Okay!
128,Ross,Okay.
129,Ross,"Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal."
130,Ross,Carol's a lesbian.
131,Ross,She's living with a woman named Susan.
132,Ross,"She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby."
133,Ross,Mrs.
134,Joey,"Your folks are really that bad, huh?"
135,Ross,"Well, y'know, these people are pros."
136,Ross,"They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done."
137,Monica,"Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could-  -I'd want yours."
138,Ross,Must pee.
139,Phoebe,"Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins."
140,Rachel,You're twins?
141,Phoebe,Yeah.
142,Phoebe,We don't speak.
143,Phoebe,"She's like this high-powered, driven career type."
144,Chandler,What does she do?
145,Phoebe,She's a waitress.
146,Rachel,"All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now."
147,Monica,"Chandler, you're an only child, right?"
148,Monica,You don't have any of this.
149,Chandler,"Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred."
150,Rachel,"The lights, please.."
151,Ross,...How long was I in there?
152,Rachel,I'm just cleaning up.
153,Ross,D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
154,Rachel,"Uh.. okay, sure!"
155,Rachel,Thanks!
156,Ross,Anyway.. um..
157,Ross,"So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?"
158,Rachel,Oh.. a little..
159,Ross,Mm-hmm..
160,Rachel,A lot.
161,Ross,Mm.
162,Rachel,"So, got any advice?"
163,Rachel,"Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?"
164,Ross,"Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'."
165,Ross,"Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard."
166,Ross,"Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN..."
167,Rachel,"Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.."
168,Rachel,When did it get so complicated?
169,Ross,Got me.
170,Rachel,Remember when we were in high school together?
171,Ross,Yeah.
172,Rachel,"I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it?"
173,Rachel,..Ross?
174,Ross,"Yes, yes!"
175,Rachel,Oh!
176,Rachel,"Man, I never thought I'd be here.."
177,Ross,Me either...
178,Ross,"Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work."
179,Ross,There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.
180,Ross,How could I forget?
181,Ross,"Hello, Susan."
182,Ross,Good shake.
183,Ross,Good shake.
184,Ross,"So, uh, we're just waiting for...?"
185,Ross,..Dr. Oberman.
186,Ross,Okay.
187,Ross,And is he-
188,Ross,"-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?"
189,Ross,"Okay, that's great."
190,Ross,"No, I'm- Oh."
191,Ross,"Quack, quack.."
192,Rachel,Barry?
193,Rachel,Are you sure?
194,Rachel,I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!
195,Rachel,I dumped him.
196,Ross,"So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work?"
197,Ross,"Y'know, with us?"
198,Ross,"Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?"
199,Ross,"Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?"
200,Ross,Marlon?
201,Ross,...As in Mouse?
202,Ross,"Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse."
203,Ross,"Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?"
204,Ross,"'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together."
205,Ross,"Things change, roll with the punches."
206,Ross,I believe Julia's on the table..?
207,Rachel,"Oh, not much."
208,Rachel,I-I got a job.
209,Rachel,Why are- why are you so tanned?
210,Rachel,Oh no.
211,Rachel,You went on our honeymoon alone?
212,Rachel,Mindy?!
213,Rachel,"My maid of honour, Mindy?"
214,Rachel,Oh!
215,Rachel,"Well, um..  You've got plugs!"
216,Rachel,And you've got lenses!
217,Rachel,But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
218,Rachel,Okay..
219,Rachel,Wow.
220,Rachel,What?
221,Rachel,"Anyway, um,  I guess this belongs to you."
222,Rachel,And thank you for giving it to me.
223,Ross,Helen Geller?
224,Ross,I don't think so.
225,Ross,Thank you!
226,Ross,"What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?"
227,Ross,"Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?"
228,Ross,"Oh, 's'funny, really?"
229,Ross,"Um, I don't remember you making any sperm."
230,Ross,"No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too."
231,Ross,"Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch."
232,Ross,My way?!
233,Ross,You-you think this is my way?
234,Ross,"Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what?"
235,Ross,"Uh, um, this is too hard."
236,Ross,"I'm not, I can't do-  Dr."
237,Ross,"You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go."
238,Ross,I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.
239,Ross,Oh my God.
240,Ross,Well?
241,Ross,Isn't that amazing?
242,Joey,What are we supposed to be seeing here?
243,Chandler,"I dunno, but.."
244,Chandler,I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
245,Phoebe,"You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato."
246,Ross,"Then don't do that, alright?"
247,Phoebe,Okay!
248,Ross,Monica.
249,Ross,Whaddya think?
250,Monica,Mm-hmm.
251,Ross,Wh- are you welling up?
252,Monica,No.
253,Ross,"You are, you're welling up."
254,Monica,Am not!
255,Ross,You're gonna be an aunt.
256,Monica,Oh shut up!
257,Rachel,"Hi, Mindy."
258,Rachel,"Hi, it-it's Rachel."
259,Rachel,"Yeah, I'm fine."
260,Rachel,I-I saw Barry today.
261,Rachel,"Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me."
262,Rachel,"No, no, it's okay."
263,Rachel,"I hope you two are very happy, I really do."
264,Rachel,"Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose."
265,Rachel,"Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now."
266,Rachel,End

1,Ross,"Okay, I know I'm not supposed to know, but I do."
2,Ross,And I'm so excited for you!
3,Joey,What?
4,Joey,What's going on?
5,Ross,Monica's pregnant!
6,Joey,Oh my God!
7,Joey,Is that why you guys had to get married?
8,Monica,Guys!
9,Monica,I'm not pregnant.
10,Joey,Ah.
11,Joey,Slow swimmers?
12,Ross,What?!
13,Ross,What do you mean?
14,Ross,You-you-you're not pregnant?
15,Monica,You didn't tell anybody I was did you?
16,Ross,No!
17,Ross,I'll be right back.
18,Monica,"Oh, about that."
19,Monica,"Joey, you have to change before the party."
20,Joey,I can't!
21,Joey,I-I don't have any other clothes here.
22,Monica,Find some!
23,Monica,Please!
24,Monica,Anything that doesn't say I-I died tragically in France.
25,Phoebe,Okay.
26,Phoebe,"Hey Mon, why did you tell the guys you weren't pregnant?"
27,Monica,Because I'm not.
28,Phoebe,"We found your test in the trash, if you're not pregnantIt's because I am."
29,Chandler,What?!
30,Chandler,What are you talking about?
31,Monica,What are you talking about?
32,Phoebe,"Yes, II am with child."
33,Phoebe,And I didn't want to say anything because it's your day; I didn't want to steal your thunder.
34,Monica,Wait a minute!
35,Monica,So you told people I was pregnant?!
36,Monica,Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember?
37,Chandler,Who's the father?
38,Monica,Yeah!
39,Phoebe,I can't say.
40,Monica,Why?
41,Chandler,Why not?
42,Phoebe,I can't say because he's famous.
43,Rachel,"Oh my God, who is it?"
44,Monica,"Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us."
45,Phoebe,"Okay, okay."
46,Phoebe,It's James Brolin.
47,Phoebe,James Brolin is the father of my baby.
48,Chandler,As in Barbara Streisand's husband James Brolin?
49,Phoebe,What?!
50,Phoebe,Well he never said that to me!
51,Phoebe,Opening Credits
52,Phoebe,How about just the bridemaids?
53,Chandler,Y'know I am the groom right?
54,Chandler,I was told it was kinda big deal.
55,Phoebe,It is.
56,Rachel,For you.
57,Phoebe,Oh my God!
58,Rachel,"Oh, thank you for doing that."
59,Rachel,I just can't deal with this just quite yet.
60,Phoebe,So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.
61,Rachel,"You said that she was, I just didn't disagree with you."
62,Phoebe,Sneaky.
63,Rachel,Oh yeah.
64,Rachel,Oh!
65,Rachel,Oh by the way?
66,Phoebe,Uh-hmm.
67,Rachel,James Brolin?
68,Phoebe,"Oh, I know."
69,Phoebe,"I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he's gay."
70,Rachel,Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
71,Phoebe,Really?
72,Chandler,Before we go out there I've got a present for ya.
73,Monica,"Honey, I'm going to put my hand in your pocket!"
74,Chandler,No?
75,Monica,No.
76,Chandler,I've been taking dancing lessons.
77,Monica,What?
78,Chandler,"Yeah, the last six weeks."
79,Chandler,I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget.
80,Monica,Oh that is so sweet!
81,Chandler,So?
82,Chandler,Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
83,Monica,Yes.
84,Monica,What's the matter?
85,Chandler,"I don't know, it's these new shoes, they're all slippery."
86,Monica,"Well, are you going to be able to do this?"
87,Chandler,Not well.
88,Monica,"Well, the good news is, I don't think anyone's looking at us."
89,Phoebe,"So, are you ready to talk about it?"
90,Rachel,No.
91,Phoebe,Now?
92,Rachel,No!
93,Phoebe,"Okay, we'll talk about something else then."
94,Rachel,Thank you.
95,Phoebe,Who's the father?
96,Rachel,Ugh!
97,Rachel,Look honey y'know what?
98,Rachel,"I haven't told him yet, so until I do I don't think I should tell anybody else."
99,Phoebe,Yeah.
100,Phoebe,That's fine.
101,Phoebe,That's fair.
102,Phoebe,Is it Tag?
103,Rachel,Phoebe!
104,Phoebe,"Okay, I'm sorry."
105,Phoebe,I'll stop.
106,Rachel,Okay.
107,Phoebe,Is it Ross?
108,Phoebe,"It's Ross isn't itOh my God, it's Joey!"
109,Rachel,"Honey, stop it!"
110,Rachel,I am not going to tell you until I tell him.
111,Phoebe,Ah-hah!
112,Phoebe,At least we know it's a him.
113,Monica,Oh sweet Lord.
114,Joey,I'm sorry!
115,Joey,Okay?
116,Joey,I went down to the gift shop and it's either this or a bathrobe!
117,Joey,"Look, what's more important, the way I'm dressed or me being with you on your special day?"
118,Monica,"Honey, I'm not even going to pretend I was listening."
119,Monica,Hey!
120,Monica,Hey!
121,Ross,Hi.
122,Ross,"I'm uh, I'm Ross."
123,Ross,"I don't, I don't believe we've met."
124,Ross,I'm Monica's older brother.
125,Ross,Oh!
126,Ross,"Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant."
127,Ross,"Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name."
128,Ross,"Aw come on, Mona Lisa?"
129,Ross,Mona ummClickclocken.
130,Ross,The famous botanist?
131,Ross,Huh?
132,Ross,Oh no she's uhwell she's dead now.
133,Ross,"No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world."
134,Ross,Linda Clickclocken.
135,Ross,"So what uh, what-what table are you at?"
136,Ross,"Oh, uh me too."
137,Ross,Yes there will.
138,Ross,"Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert you've just been bumped up to table one."
139,Ross,And if it's all right with you I'm gonna take your place at table sixMartin Clickclocken.
140,Joey,"That's better, now just bend your arms a little more."
141,Joey,There you go.
142,Joey,"Okay, look straight ahead."
143,Joey,Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it.
144,Joey,Mrs.
145,Chandler,Thank you.
146,Chandler,Mrs.
147,Chandler,Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.
148,Chandler,Dennis
149,Joey,"I don't believe we've met, Joey Tribbiani."
150,Joey,Dennis
151,Joey,"Wow, I've admired your work for years."
152,Joey,You-you've done some really amazing stuff.
153,Joey,Dennis
154,Joey,Wow Dennis Phillips!
155,Joey,That's great!
156,Joey,How did you guys meet?
157,Joey,Mrs.
158,Ross,Hey!
159,Ross,"Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six."
160,Ross,"Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way  which uh, which was misleading."
161,Ross,Well I'm  Hello.
162,Joey,Chandler.
163,Joey,Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips?
164,Joey,"Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would've done it all, film, television, and theater."
165,Joey,"The only think left would be radio, and that's just for ugly people."
166,Chandler,What size shoes do you wear?
167,Joey,"Uh, eleven, eleven and a half."
168,Chandler,"Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?"
169,Joey,"Uh, I don't even really know where I left those."
170,Joey,Sorry.
171,Chandler,Those aren't eleven and a half.
172,Joey,Okay fine!
173,Joey,I'm a seven!
174,Joey,"All right, I have surprisingly small feet."
175,Joey,"But the rest of me is good, I'll show ya!"
176,Monica,Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?
177,Rachel,Oh y'know what honey?
178,Rachel,Let's not talk about that right now?
179,Monica,This is so huge.
180,Rachel,"Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?"
181,Monica,Of course not nothing is.
182,Monica,Between me and you
183,Rachel,Yeah.
184,Monica,in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?
185,Rachel,Hey!
186,Rachel,"Y'know, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything they're supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through!"
187,Monica,How?
188,Rachel,I don't know!
189,Rachel,Maybe they have tools.
190,Monica,"Well I-I talked to and uh, she's definitely going to have this baby."
191,Monica,"Y'know, she said she was gonna raise it on her own."
192,Rachel,"Well, maybe that's, maybe that's really brave."
193,Monica,Maybe.
194,Monica,I just hope she realizes how hard it's gonna be.
195,Rachel,Maybe she hasn't really thought it through that well.
196,Monica,"Well, there's a lot to think about."
197,Monica,"I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially?"
198,Monica,How is she going to juggle work?
199,Monica,Does she realize she's not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?
200,Rachel,I don't know.
201,Monica,Are you okay?
202,Rachel,Uh-hmm.
203,Rachel,I'm just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.
204,Rachel,Oh yes!
205,Rachel,Thank you very much!
206,Rachel,Oh that's-that's actually how the French drink it.
207,Rachel,Commercial Break
208,Phoebe,"Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolin"
209,Monica,Oh really?
210,Phoebe,"Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me."
211,Phoebe,"And I said, ""James, James Brolin, are you sure?"""
212,Phoebe,James Brolin said
213,Monica,Rachel's really the one who's pregnant.
214,Phoebe,What?!
215,Phoebe,Why bother?
216,Monica,How do you feel?
217,Rachel,I don't know.
218,Rachel,I don't know how I feel.
219,Rachel,This is all happening so fast.
220,Rachel,I have to make all these decisions that I don't want to make.
221,Rachel,Somebody just take this away from me!
222,Phoebe,Calm down.
223,Phoebe,Maybe you're not pregnant.
224,Rachel,What?
225,Phoebe,"When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure."
226,Monica,Yes!
227,Monica,Maybe it's a false positive.
228,Monica,Are you sure you peed on the stick right?
229,Rachel,How many ways are there to do that?
230,Phoebe,"I'm-I'm just saying, don't freak out until you're a hundred percent sure."
231,Rachel,"All right, I'll-I'll take it again when I get home."
232,Monica,You-you gotta take it now.
233,Monica,"Come on, do it as a present to me."
234,Rachel,Okay.
235,Rachel,Thank you.
236,Monica,Okay.
237,Phoebe,I'll run out and get you one.
238,Rachel,"Oh, you guys are so great."
239,Monica,"Oh, wait a minute!"
240,Monica,Who's is the father?
241,Phoebe,"Oh no, she won't tell us."
242,Monica,"Oh, come on it's my wedding!"
243,Monica,That can be my present.
244,Rachel,"WhHey, I just gave you peeing on a stick."
245,Phoebe,See?
246,Phoebe,This is why you register.
247,Ross,It was the chair again!
248,Ross,Okay?
249,Ross,I'm not doing it!

276,Chandler,"Yes, I told him how talented you were."
277,Chandler,I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.
278,Joey,No-no!
279,Joey,No!
280,Joey,No!
281,Joey,You don't tell a Broadway guy that!
282,Joey,Now he just thinks I'm a soap actor.
283,Chandler,But you're not just a soap actor.
284,Chandler,You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.
285,Joey,Hey!
286,Joey,Little

302,Joey,"I was like,  ""Why God?"
303,Joey,Why?
304,Joey,"How can you take them away from me?!"""
305,Joey,"But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories."
306,Joey,And-and there was some sad memories.
307,Joey,I'm sorry.
308,Joey,And-and some scared memoriesWhoa!
309,Joey,Eh?
310,Joey,"And then, and then I realized I'll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity."
311,Joey,Oh!

341,Monica,"Ohh come on, I love this song!"
342,Monica,"Come on, you'll be fine."
343,Chandler,No.
344,Chandler,"No, I won't."
345,Chandler,Do you know why I took all those lessons?
346,Chandler,"See, for the first time I didn't want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot."
347,Monica,"Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me."

1,Joey,Phoebe Sr.
2,Phoebe,Ehh?
3,Joey,"Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldn't go out with a guy like Chandler..."
4,Chandler,Hi there.
5,Joey,"...and he couldn't let it go, and..."
6,Joey,I don't really know what happened with that either.
7,Joey,Oh-oh!

27,Rachel,"Well, can't you tell her that you are not in the mood?"
28,Ross,"No, she likes that."
29,Ross,Yeah.
30,Ross,"Faking sleep doesn't work either, I can't tell you how many mornings I woke up with her..."
31,Rachel,Whoa-ho.
32,Ross,"Whoa-oh, okay!"
33,Ross,"Yeah, why am I telling you that?"

44,Phoebe,Phoebe Sr.
45,Phoebe,I don't even know how that would work!

53,Phoebe,I'm a really cool person.
54,Phoebe,"And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn't even try!"
55,Phoebe,"Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I'm just, I'm gonna do the same thing to you."
56,Phoebe,Phoebe Sr.
57,Phoebe,I don't ever want to see you again!
58,Phoebe,"Umm, where's my purse?"
59,Monica,Shoot!
60,Monica,We're out of soda.

78,Ross,"Well, it was loong."
79,Ross,"I didn't even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head."
80,Ross,"Anyway, she didn't want to stay."
81,Ross,I called a cab; she just left.
82,Rachel,I wrote you a letter.
83,Ross,Ohh!
84,Ross,Thank you!
85,Ross,I like mail.
86,Rachel,It's just some things I've been thinking about.
87,Rachel,"Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff."
88,Ross,Okay.
89,Ross,"Wow, it's-it's"
90,Rachel,"Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done."

98,Rachel,Why didn't you come up?
99,Ross,Done!
100,Rachel,You just finished?
101,Ross,"Well, I wanted to be thorough."
102,Ross,"I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us!"
103,Ross,"And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!"
104,Rachel,"So umm, does it?"
105,Ross,I'm sorry.
106,Rachel,Does it?
107,Ross,Does it?
108,Ross,Does it?
109,Ross,"Yeah, I wanted to give that whole Does it?'"
110,Ross,part just another glance.
111,Rachel,"What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!"
112,Rachel,"Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even think about it..."
113,Ross,"No, Rach, no."
114,Ross,"I don't, I don't, I don't have to think about it, in fact, I've decided, I've decided that, that it.......does."
115,Rachel,Are you sure?
116,Ross,"Oh, sure!"

154,Chandler,"There's something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain."
155,Monica,Well forget it!
156,Monica,It doesn't hurt that  baaad!!!

181,Ross,Commercial Break
182,Ross,She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship.
183,Ross,"I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her!"
184,Ross,WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!
185,Chandler,Oh my God!
186,Chandler,"If you say that one more time, I'm gonna break up with you!"
187,Ross,Fine!
188,Ross,Fine!
189,Ross,"But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  If you accept full responsibility...  Full responsibility!"
190,Ross,...I can begin to trust you again.
191,Ross,Does that seem like something you can do.
192,Ross,Does it?!
193,Ross,!
194,Joey,No?
195,Chandler,"Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel."
196,Chandler,If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
197,Ross,"Yeah, I know."
198,Ross,"I mean, no, you're right."
199,Ross,Yeah I guess I'll let it go.
200,Ross,But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
201,Joey,"Sure, it's hard to forget!"
202,Joey,But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it!
203,Joey,"A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about."
204,Ross,What the hell happened on that beach?
205,Joey,"It's between us and the sea, Ross!"
206,Phoebe,"Hi, Ursula."
207,Phoebe,"Okay, well umm, I know that we haven't talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom."
208,Phoebe,This-this other lady is our birth Mom.
209,Phoebe,You know her?
210,Phoebe,There-there was a suicide note?!
211,Phoebe,"Well, do you still have it?"
212,Phoebe,I can't believe you didn't tell me there was a suicide note!
213,Phoebe,"I, umm, shut up!"
214,Phoebe,Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula.

219,Monica,"Pass the cheese, please."
220,Monica,"My God, you can't even look at me!"
221,Monica,Can you?
222,Joey,Nope.
223,Chandler,Hey!
224,Chandler,Phoebe!
225,Chandler,We can talk to Phoebe!
226,Phoebe,No.
227,Phoebe,I'm-I'm to depressed to talk.
228,Chandler,I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
229,Ross,"Hey, you guys!"
230,Ross,"What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?"
231,Ross,"Chandler, Monica, and"
232,Joey,NO!!
233,Rachel,"All right, that's it, you guys!"
234,Rachel,What happened out there?
235,Monica,What?
236,Monica,"We took a walk, nothing happened."
237,Monica,I can back with nothing all over me.
238,Monica,Ross and

245,Chandler,They'll never understand!
246,Joey,"Well, we have to say something!"
247,Joey,We have to get it out!
248,Joey,It's eating me alive!!
249,Joey,Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
250,Monica,All right!!
251,Monica,All right.
252,Monica,I got stung.
253,Monica,Stung bad.
254,Monica,I couldn't stand.
255,Monica,I-I couldn't walk.
256,Chandler,We were two miles from the house.
257,Chandler,Scared and alone.
258,Chandler,We didn't think we could make it.
259,Monica,I was in too much pain.
260,Joey,And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
261,Chandler,And then Joey remembered something.
262,Joey,I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
263,Ross,Wait a minute!
264,Ross,I saw that!
265,Ross,"On The Discovery Channel, yeah!"

273,Monica,I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain!
274,Monica,"Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way."
275,Monica,"So...  Phoebe, Ross, and"
276,Rachel,Ewwww!
277,Joey,That's right I stepped up!
278,Joey,She's my friend and she needed help!
279,Joey,"And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you!"
280,Joey,"Only, uhh, I couldn't."
281,Joey,I got the stage fright.
282,Joey,"I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure."
283,Joey,"So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler."
284,Chandler,"Joey kept screaming at me, Do it now!"
285,Chandler,Do it!!
286,Chandler,Do it!
287,Chandler,Do it now!
288,Chandler,! Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
289,Joey,That's cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
290,Phoebe,...fuchsia and mauvvve.
291,Phoebe,"Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm.  Thank you, thank you."
292,Phoebe,"Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom."
293,Phoebe,Except for you.
294,Phoebe,You go away.

297,Phoebe,Phoebe Sr.
298,Phoebe,No.
299,Phoebe,Phoebe Sr.
300,Phoebe,"But, it's not like we're losing anything."

318,Phoebe,I'm kinda hungry.
319,Phoebe,Phoebe Sr.
320,Phoebe,"All right, stop it."
321,Phoebe,Now you're just doing it to freak me out.
322,Rachel,"Oh-hooo, I missed you."
323,Ross,I missed you too.
324,Rachel,"Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter."
325,Rachel,"But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown."
326,Rachel,Y'know?
327,Ross,I suppose.
328,Rachel,You have!
329,Rachel,"Ross, you should give yourself credit."
330,Rachel,I mean my Mom never thought this would work out.
331,Rachel,"It was all, Once a cheater, always a cheater."
332,Ross,Umm-hmm.
333,Rachel,"Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective..."
334,Ross,WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!
335,Chandler,Coffee house?
336,Monica,You bet.
337,Ross,"And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!"
338,Rachel,Yeah!
339,Rachel,"You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!"
340,Ross,I didn't know what I was taking full responsibility for!
341,Ross,Okay?!

351,Monica,Hey!
352,Rachel,Sorry!!
353,Rachel,I just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss wishing you were with me!
354,Ross,"Oh, no-no-no don't you worry about me falling asleep."
355,Ross,I still have your letter!!
356,Rachel,And hey!

365,Monica,Will you stop!
366,Chandler,Okay.
367,Chandler,All right.
368,Monica,"Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you."

4,Monica,"Joey, you have to talk to her!"
5,Joey,"No-no, I can't!"
6,Joey,I can't!

18,Monica,Maybe he's in the sugar bowl!
19,Monica,Joey?
20,Monica,Nope!
21,Rachel,"Well, at least you make each other laugh."
22,Monica,What's up?
23,Rachel,"Well, I haven't seen him since that night that he told me how he y'know I don't know, I think he's avoiding me."
24,Rachel,Why is that bagel on the floor?
25,Monica,We were playing a game.
26,Rachel,"Ew, was Chandler naked?"
27,Rachel,"Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of situation?"
28,Monica,Sure.
29,Chandler,What?!

31,Chandler,No!
32,Rachel,All right.
33,Rachel,"Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell him uhtell him I miss him."
34,Monica,"Okay, did you hear that?"
35,Joey,"Yeah, a naked bagel game?"
36,Joey,"Dude, I don't know."
37,Joey,That's a pretty small hole.
38,Monica,"Honey, you gotta talk to her."
39,Joey,I can't!
40,Joey,Y'know?
41,Joey,You guys don't know what it's like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.
42,Chandler,I don't know what that's like?!
43,Chandler,"Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, ""I love you,"" was, ""Oh crap!"""
44,Monica,Hello?
45,Monica,No rejection?
46,Monica,I got shot down at fat camp!
47,Monica,"Boy, kids are mean when they're hungry."
48,Joey,"All right so, so what do I do?"
49,Monica,This is Rachel.
50,Monica,"I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again?"
51,Monica,"I mean I know it's weird, it's awkward, but you gotta at least try."
52,Joey,Yeah.
53,Joey,Okay.
54,Joey,Whoa!
55,Joey,I almost forgot this was on your
56,Chandler,We didn't play it!!
57,Chandler,Opening Credits
58,Phoebe,"Okay, so when you're done with your tea I'll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune."
59,Chandler,I didn't know you read tea leaves.
60,Phoebe,"Oh yeah, I've done it for years."
61,Phoebe,I actually stopped because I was so accurate.
62,Phoebe,"Y'know, and-and y'know, one of the great joys of life is it's-it's wondrous unpredictability."
63,Phoebe,Y'know?
64,Phoebe,And also tea tends to give me the trots.
65,Monica,"Okay, I'm done."
66,Monica,Read mine.
67,Phoebe,Okay.
68,Phoebe,"Ooh, I see a ladder."
69,Phoebe,Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.
70,Monica,I-I'm the head chef.
71,Monica,I-I can't get promoted.
72,Phoebe,Uh-hmm.
73,Phoebe,"Uh-hmm, who's next?"
74,Rachel,"Okay, I'm done."
75,Rachel,Do mine.
76,Phoebe,Okay.
77,Phoebe,"Umm, oh!"
78,Phoebe,"Okay, I see a circle."
79,Rachel,Ah.
80,Phoebe,Oh!
81,Phoebe,Which can either mean you're having a baby or you're gonna make a scientific discovery!
82,Rachel,"Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab."
83,Chandler,What does yours say Pheebs?
84,Phoebe,"Umm Wow, all right."
85,Phoebe,Wow!
86,Phoebe,Yay!
87,Phoebe,"Ooh, I'm gonna meet a guy!"
88,Phoebe,And really soon!
89,Phoebe,And he's gonna be the man of my dreams.
90,Phoebe,Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night.
91,Ross,Hey!
92,Ross,Has anyone seen my shirt?
93,Ross,"It's a button down, like a, like a faded salmon?"
94,Monica,You mean your pink shirt?
95,Ross,Faded salmon color.
96,Monica,"No, I-I haven't seen your pink shirt."
97,Ross,Great!
98,Ross,Great.
99,Ross,Then I must've left it at Mona's.
100,Ross,I knew it!
101,Chandler,"Well, I'm sure you get another one at Ann Taylor's."
102,Ross,That's my favorite shirt!
103,Ross,Okay?
104,Ross,I love that shirt!
105,Rachel,Well just ask Mona to give it back!
106,Ross,I don't know.
107,Ross,I mean I-I guess I could.
108,Ross,It's just that we didn't really end things such good terms.
109,Ross,"And if I go over there I'd be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die."
110,Phoebe,Oh wait a second you guysfor the last couple weeks I've been that guy everywhere I go.
111,Phoebe,We take the same bus.
112,Phoebe,"We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he's the tea guy."
113,Chandler,"Phoebe, did you see that?!"
114,Chandler,He totally checked you out!
115,Chandler,He is so cute!
116,Chandler,"Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?"
117,Rachel,Hi!
118,Joey,Hey.
119,Rachel,Hi.
120,Joey,Hi.
121,Monica,Tea gives Phoebe the trots.
122,Rachel,"So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but it's not even like we know how to be with each other anymore."
123,Chandler,"I know it's tough now, but things will get better."
124,Rachel,How do you know that?
125,Rachel,"What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can't even be in the same room with each other?"
126,Chandler,"I'm not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment?"
127,Chandler,Some cheese?
128,Monica,"Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?"
129,Chandler,Let's just say if I can't find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.
130,Monica,"Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?"
131,Chandler,In the James Taylor case.
132,Monica,Where is the James Taylor CD?
133,Chandler,"Honey, I'm gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case."
134,Monica,Okay.
135,Monica,No need to panic.
136,Monica,Deep breathes everyone.
137,Monica,"Okay umm uh, we're just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases."
138,Chandler,"Well, if we're gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order."
139,Chandler,Y'know alphabetically or by genre?
140,Monica,"Hmm, I don't know."
141,Monica,We really have to talk this through.
142,Rachel,Oh my God!!
143,Rachel,You guys have such problems!!
144,Rachel,I feel so terrible for you!
145,Monica,"Okay, I-I'm sorry."
146,Monica,"You and Joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject."
147,Monica,Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.
148,Rachel,Oh yeah.
149,Rachel,That makes sense.
150,Monica,"Yeah, like I don't know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on."
151,Rachel,"Ooh, I can do that."
152,Monica,Good.
153,Monica,"Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack?"
154,Monica,Really?
155,Chandler,They were just giving those away at the store  in exchange for money.
156,Joey,Hey!
157,Rachel,Hi.
158,Monica,"Uh I really don't know what to tell you Rach, I really don't."
159,Monica,"I mean, maybe Joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem."
160,Rachel,What?
161,Monica,"Yeah Joey she'sRachel's got this really big work problem, and it is a head scratcher."
162,Monica,Wow!
163,Monica,"Y'know what, if we're gonna make dinner we're gonna have to leave."
164,Monica,Yeah.
165,Joey,"So you uh, have abig work problem?"
166,Rachel,Yeah it's umm Yeah it's uh It-it's y'knowIt's nothing.
167,Joey,Huh.
168,Joey,Okay.
169,Joey,"So uh, I think I'm gonna take off."
170,Rachel,YeahNo wait!
171,Rachel,Joey no wait it is.
172,Rachel,It's something.
173,Rachel,It's-it's ummit's my boss.
174,Joey,Yeah?
175,Rachel,"Yeah, and umm my baby."
176,Joey,Yeah?
177,Rachel,My boss wants to buy my baby!
178,Joey,What?!
179,Joey,Oh my-oh my God!
180,Rachel,"I know I told you, it's a really big problem."
181,Joey,What he wants to buy your baby?
182,Rachel,Can you believe that?
183,Joey,That's crazy!
184,Rachel,That's what I told him!
185,Joey,"Okay, how did this even happen?"
186,Rachel,Well I'll tell ya!
187,Rachel,See uh my-my boss and his wifeThey-they can't have children.
188,Rachel,"So umm, and thatwe were at the Christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, ""Rachel, I want to buy your baby."""
189,Joey,Man!
190,Joey,When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured it was something about maternity leave.
191,Rachel,Ohh!
192,Rachel,Yeah!
193,Rachel,Yeah that-that would've been a much simpler problem.
194,Phoebe,Oh hello.
195,Phoebe,"Oh Jim, Jim Nelson I'm Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay."
196,Phoebe,We certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately.
197,Phoebe,"Well, maybe we will."
198,Phoebe,Oh!
199,Ross,Mona?
200,Ross,"Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be?"
201,Chandler,"Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together."
202,Chandler,We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack.
203,Monica,"Honey, both yours."
204,Rachel,Hey!
205,Rachel,Great advice on that Joey thing!
206,Monica,Yeah?
207,Monica,The work problem?
208,Rachel,Oh it was perfect!
209,Rachel,I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
210,Chandler,What problem did you tell him you had?
211,Rachel,Oh that's not important.
212,Rachel,"The point is, I reallyI think everything's gonna be okay."
213,Joey,Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!
214,Joey,Commercial Break
215,Phoebe,Isn't it funny how we kept running into each other?
216,Phoebe,It's as if someone really wants us to be together.
217,Phoebe,"Oh, witty banter."
218,Phoebe,Well done.
219,Phoebe,"Oh okay, well I'm a masseuse, and I used to work at this place"
220,Phoebe,"I-I-I like, I like parties."
221,Phoebe,"Yeah I guess, a little."
222,Phoebe,So!
223,Phoebe,"Umm, anyway I-I lived in New York, someone wildly I guess, for ummWell since I was fourteen."
224,Phoebe,Oh stop it.
225,Phoebe,Okay.
226,Phoebe,"Umm look, you're coming on a little strong."
227,Phoebe,"But I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together."
228,Phoebe,"So, why don't we just start over okay?"

241,Rachel,That really meant a lot.
242,Joey,Not a problem.
243,Joey,"Oh, and just so you know, that guy's not going to be bothering you about that baby thing anymore."
244,Rachel,What?
245,Joey,Let's just say I took care of it.
246,Rachel,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, let's say more!"
247,Joey,Don't worry!
248,Joey,Don't worry.
249,Joey,"I just told him, very nicely, ""You don't go buying people's babies, so back off!!"""

255,Rachel,I made that up!
256,Joey,What?!
257,Joey,Why?
258,Rachel,So that we would have something to talk about!
259,Rachel,So it wouldn't be awkward!
260,Joey,And you couldn't think of anything else?
261,Monica,You said your boss wants to buy your baby?
262,Rachel,I can't believe that you yelled at my boss!
263,Rachel,I'm-I'm gonna lose my job!
264,Rachel,What am I going to do?
265,Chandler,You can always sell your baby.

284,Phoebe,"I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one."
285,Phoebe,"I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store"
286,Monica,What?
287,Phoebe,A new grocery store.
288,Phoebe,The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that's what they gave me?
289,Phoebe,When I get up there I'm going to kick some ass.
290,Monica,"Don't worry Phoebe, you're gonna meet someone."
291,Monica,"If I can meet a great guy, so can you."
292,Phoebe,"Yeah, we both can."
293,Phoebe,And we both will.
294,Phoebe,"Oh, you didn't have to come in with me."

296,Monica,This is where they get out stains!
297,Monica,Okay?
298,Monica,This is like Disneyland for me.
299,Monica,I'm-I'm gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts.
300,Phoebe,Okay.
301,Phoebe,What?

309,Phoebe,She must've left.
310,Rachel,Hi.
311,Joey,So?
312,Joey,What-what-what happened?
313,Rachel,It's all gonna be okay.
314,Rachel,They're just so happy that I'm not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave.
315,Rachel,So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.
316,Chandler,"Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show they're not in the baby buying business."
317,Rachel,"Chandler, can you give us a minute?"
318,Chandler,"Oh I'm sorry, you're kicking me out of my own living room?"
319,Rachel,Yeah.
320,Chandler,I'll be in there.

322,Rachel,I was just trying to make things
323,Joey,I know.
324,Joey,I know.
325,Rachel,It kinda worked.
326,Rachel,"I mean y'know, I don't know about you buy I haven't thought about our thing since all this."
327,Joey,Hey you're right.
328,Joey,"Yeah, it's kinda been like us again a little bit."
329,Rachel,Yeah I know!
330,Rachel,I miss that.
331,Joey,Me too.
332,Joey,I mean Ihaven't thought at all about how I put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you didn't feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.
333,Rachel,My gynecologist tried to kill me.

11,Joey,Thanks.
12,Ross,An egg?
13,Joey,"Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, ""Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."""

28,Phoebe,"'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!"
29,Monica,"But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year."
30,Monica,I know I do.
31,Rachel,"Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?"
32,Joey,"Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes."
33,Chandler,"Oh, uh, listen, about tonight..."
34,Joey,"No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me."
35,Joey,The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
36,Chandler,"Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a..."
37,Joey,Pathetic mess?
38,Joey,"I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable."
39,Joey,"I'm thinkin', cha-ching!"

61,Chandler,You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
62,Joey,Can you stop yellin'?
63,Joey,"You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous."
64,Chandler,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right."
65,Chandler,"Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!"
66,Rachel,"Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney."
67,Monica,Which one was Pete Carney?
68,Rachel,Pete the Weeper?
69,Rachel,Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex.
70,Rachel,"""Was it good for you?"""

75,Rachel,How did we end up with these jerks?
76,Rachel,We're good people!
77,Monica,I don't know.
78,Monica,Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
79,Phoebe,I know I am.
80,Phoebe,That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
81,Monica,"There's more beer, right?"
82,Phoebe,Oh!
83,Phoebe,You know my friend Abby who shaves her head?
84,Phoebe,"She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual."
85,Rachel,"Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald."
86,Phoebe,Yeah.
87,Phoebe,"So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys."

147,Monica,Yeah.
148,Monica,There's someone I want you to say hi to.
149,Monica,He just happened to call.
150,Ross,"I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half."
151,Ross,"The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend."
152,Ross,If you wanna put a label on it.
153,Ross,"Nope, nope, that's it."
154,Ross,"Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby."
155,Ross,I always forget that part.
156,Ross,Helloo!

158,Monica,"All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca."
159,Phoebe,"Um, that's ok!"
160,Phoebe,Ok. All right.
161,Phoebe,Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
162,Rachel,"Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place."
163,Monica,Can we just start throwing things in?
164,Phoebe,"Ok, yeah, ok.  Oh, OK."

175,Chandler,How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
176,Joey,I don't know.
177,Joey,You dumped her on New Year's.
178,Chandler,"Oh, man."
179,Chandler,"In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush."
180,Chandler,"Hi, Just Janice."
181,Joey,"If you don't do it, I will."
182,Ross,"So, um, what do you do for a living?"
183,Ross,Now that is funny.
184,Ross,"Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?"
185,Ross,"'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad."
186,Ross,Are you sure?
187,Ross,Great.
188,Ross,Carol?

212,Chandler,I just don't things are gonna work out.
213,Chandler,It is?
214,Chandler,"Oh no, you see, actually it is."
215,Chandler,"Oh, no I don't."
216,Chandler,"I did, but..."
217,Chandler,Call me!
218,Ross,You did so.
219,Ross,"I swear, I swear How long has she been in the bathroom?"
220,Ross,Well maybe it's cold in there.
221,Ross,Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
222,Ross,"Oh, god."
223,Ross,"You know, this is still pretty hot."
224,Ross,"No, it's just...you know the whole ""getting on with your life"" thing."
225,Ross,"Well, do I have to?"
226,Ross,"I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it."
227,Ross,"And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought."
228,Ross,"Um, what's say you and I give it another shot?"
229,Ross,"No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian."
230,Ross,But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know?
231,Ross,"Let's just stick a pin in it, ok?"
232,Ross,"Because, we're great together, you know."
233,Ross,You can't deny it.
234,Ross,"Besides, you're carrying my baby."
235,Ross,"I mean, how perfect is that?"
236,Ross,"But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here."

107,Ross,My mom is gonna be  with her.
108,Ross,She's great with kids.
109,Rachel,She is?
110,Ross,Ya.
111,Rachel,What about  Monica.
112,Ross,"Hey, you only heard Monica's side of that."
113,Ross,That little fatso was  a terror.
114,Rachel,Ish.
115,Rachel,I just don't think I can bear it.
116,Ross,"Rachel, I know that you can."
117,Ross,And you should.
118,Rachel,Uch.
119,Ross,"Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why don't you, why  don't you go ahead to the restaurant and I will wait for my mom and then I'll  meet you there."
120,Rachel,Oh-A.
121,Ross,"No, no, really."
122,Ross,You should go.
123,Ross,Just go!
124,Ross,Go!
125,Ross,Go out!
126,Ross,"Really, the  world is your oyster."
127,Ross,Kick up the heels.
128,Ross,Paint the town red.
129,Rachel,You need to learn some new slang.
130,Ross,I'm serious.
131,Ross,"C'mon, you should go."
132,Ross,Here.
133,Ross,"No, uh-uh, just go."
134,Rachel,What  Oh!
135,Ross,No!
136,Ross,"No, you know what?"
137,Ross,"You  , the baby's fine, now squam ."
138,Ross,"Yeah,  story  walking."
139,Rachel,I was just going to say that I left my keys.
140,Ross,"Oh,  holy molly are we in a pickle now."
141,Phoebe,Where is everyone?
142,Phoebe,They're forty minutes late.
143,Joey,"I know, u-uch."
144,Phoebe,I'm starving.
145,Phoebe,"I know we were coming here tonight, I ate  nothing all day."
146,Joey,"What about me, he?"
147,Joey,Only had one lunch today.
148,Phoebe,"Yes, they are expected presently."
149,Phoebe,"Yeah, yeah um, their arrival  is in the offing."
150,Joey,"No, they're comin', we're waitin' right here."
151,Phoebe,Joseph!
152,Phoebe,"Thou needn't worry, they shan't be  long."
153,Phoebe,One really does have a stick up one's ass.
154,Phoebe,Doesn't one?
155,Monica,How can you smoke in this day of age?
156,Monica,"Do you not seen that ad  with a little kid walks to grandpa, it's chilling."
157,Chandler,"I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking."
158,Monica,So what?
159,Monica,Don't you have any will power?
160,Chandler,Will power?
161,Chandler,I've watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs   without taking the tin foil off.
162,Monica,You said that was sexy!
163,Chandler,"'kay,"
164,Monica,"That's right, because I forbid you to smoke again."
165,Chandler,You forbid me?
166,Monica,Mhmm.
167,Chandler,"You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife?"
168,Chandler,Is she  here by the way?
169,Monica,"Don't joke  with me, okay?"
170,Monica,"I'm very, very upset right  now."
171,Chandler,"Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?"
172,Monica,Yes.
173,Chandler,"Then, I might as well   do this  ."
174,Chandler,Not really sure what to do now.
175,Monica,"Well, I'll tell you what we're gonna"
176,Chandler,Fine.
177,Chandler,What!
178,Monica,Sex!
179,Monica,"This is the last day I'm ovulating, and when we don't do  it now, we'll have to wait till next month."
180,Chandler,You serious?
181,Monica,Oh yeah!
182,Chandler,"Right, fine, I'll do it, but no talking."
183,Monica,"Huh, and no cuddling."
184,Chandler,And no kissing your neck.
185,Monica,"Oh good, I hate it when you do that"
186,Chandler,And lots of kissing your neck.
187,Ross,"Okay, well the ???"
188,Ross,is not home.
189,Rachel,No.
190,Rachel,Uch.
191,Ross,"Oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute."
192,Ross,And she has  the keys.
193,Rachel,"Alright, I can't, I can't wait that long."
194,Rachel,You have to do  somethingknock that door down!
195,Ross,"I would, but I bruise like a peach."
196,Ross,"Besides, yyou know,  everything is gonna be fine."
197,Ross,The baby's sleeping.
198,Rachel,What if she jumped out the bassinet?
199,Ross,"Can't hold her own head up, but yeah jumped."
200,Rachel,"Oh my god, I left the water running."
201,Ross,Rach you did not leave the water running.
202,Ross,"Please, just pull  yourself together, okay?"
203,Rachel,"Ah, did I leave the stove on?"
204,Ross,You never cooked since 1996.
205,Rachel,Is the window open?
206,Rachel,"Because if there's a window open, a bird  could fly in there."
207,Ross,"Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think you're right."
208,Ross,"I think   listen, listen!"
209,Rachel,Ubb.
210,Ross,"A pigeon, a pigeon."
211,Ross,"No, no  wait, no-no, an eagle flew in."
212,Ross,Landed on the stove and caught fire.
213,Ross,"The baby,  seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid."
214,Ross,"The eagle,  however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon."
215,Ross,Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water.
216,Ross,"Baby and bird still up lays   are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the  apartment."
217,Rachel,"Boy, are you gonna be sorry if that's true."
218,Joey,Hey.
219,Joey,Maybe we should just eat now.
220,Joey,Wha-a how about
221,Joey,But it happens?
222,Joey,I'm gotta go to the  bathroom.
223,Phoebe,"No, you can't go."
224,Phoebe,"No-no-no, I can't hold this table on my own."
225,Phoebe,"If they ask me to move, I cave."
226,Joey,"If you ask me to stay, I'll pee."
227,Joey,Maitre D'
228,Phoebe,"Okay, fine, I'll move."
229,Phoebe,"Alright, you don't have to manhandle  me."
230,Phoebe,Where?
231,Phoebe,Okay.
232,Phoebe,Thank you.
233,Phoebe,Wach.
234,Joey,Finally you guys made it.
235,Joey,"Pheebs, who the helluhuhh!"
236,Monica,Spend more time with the tie.
237,Monica,That'll make a baby.
238,Chandler,"Look, I can't do this."
239,Chandler,I can't make luv to you while we're  fighting this way.
240,Monica,"Oh sure, now you're Mister Sensitivity."
241,Monica,But when you wanted to  have sex right after my uncle's funeral
242,Chandler,That was a celebration of life.
243,Chandler,"Alright, look, I'm not gonna  do this."
244,Chandler,"Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?"
245,Monica,"No, you're right."
246,Monica,"Mnya, we shouldn't do it like this."
247,Monica,Huch.
248,Monica,"For what it's worth, I'm, I'm sorry."
249,Monica,I shouldn't have come down on you so hard  about the smoking.
250,Monica,"So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world."
251,Chandler,Mean it?
252,Monica,Yah.
253,Chandler,You are incredible.
254,Chandler,"Unless, II'm not gonna smoke again."
255,Chandler,"And  if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you."
256,Monica,D'you want to?
257,Chandler,"Yeah, let's celebrate life!"
258,Monica,'kay.
259,Rachel,"Och, god."
260,Rachel,"Oh, thank god, you're okay."
261,Rachel,I'm so  sorry we left you.
262,Rachel,Mom never gonna leave you again.
263,Rachel,Never ever ever again.
264,Rachel,Uch.
265,Ross,Great.
266,Ross,So let's get going?
267,Rachel,Oh no.
268,Rachel,I mean it.
269,Rachel,"After what just happened, I'm never leaving  her again."
270,Rachel,Ms.
271,Ross,Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.
272,Chandler,Uhh.
273,Chandler,You are welcome.
274,Monica,You know what?
275,Monica,Let's not talk.
276,Chandler,What?
277,Monica,Uch.
278,Monica,I am still so mad at you for smoking.
279,Chandler,But you said you forgave me.
280,Chandler,It was just a couple of  cigarettesno big deal.
281,Monica,"Oh, blablablabaybaybay."
282,Chandler,Leave it.
283,Monica,I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said  you wouldn't have sex with me while we're fighting.
284,Chandler,You tricked me to get me into bed?
285,Monica,"That's right, I got mine."
286,Chandler,I feel so used.
287,Phoebe,"Well, I guess they're not coming."
288,Phoebe,You wanna just order?
289,Joey,Thank you.
290,Joey,Waiter!
291,Joey,"'lright,  this is gonna be fast, so try to keep"
292,Phoebe,Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?
293,Phoebe,"Both it is, thank you."
294,Joey,"Oh, uh, again."
295,Joey,Can I make a special
296,Rachel,"Hey, hi, hi!"
297,Phoebe,You guys are over an hour late.
298,Phoebe,What happened to you two?
299,Ross,I'm so sorry
300,Rachel,"We got locked out of the apartment, we"
301,Joey,That's a great storycan I eat it?
302,Ross,And then Rachel wasn't sure she could leave the baby.
303,Rachel,"N-it wasn't easy, but it's your birthday and I did what I got  to do."
304,Phoebe,And that's Judy over there at the bar with Emma?
305,Rachel,"Oh honey, this is for the best, thus I'm not distracted,  worrying about Emma, how she's doing at home and I'm being completely here with  you and, oh, she spit up!"
306,Ross,What?
307,Rachel,She spit up.
308,Rachel,Judy!
309,Rachel,She spiJudy!
310,Rachel,"Look alive, Judy!"
311,Rachel,Thank you.
312,Ross,Thanks.
313,Ross,Oh.
314,Rachel,"Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious."
315,Rachel,What should I ha-ave?
316,Rachel,What should I have?
317,Joey,Never hit a woman.
318,Joey,Never hit a woman.
319,Ross,Y'know this ???
320,Ross,is incredible.
321,Joey,Ross bruises like a peach.
322,Joey,He bruises like a peach.
323,Ross,"Okay, I'll have the fixed salad and the duck."
324,Rachel,"Yah, I'll have the soup and the salmon."
325,Joey,And remember whatever comes up first.
326,Joey,Okay?
327,Joey,"And hurry, because"
328,Monica,Happy birthday!
329,Joey,Son of a bitch!
330,Phoebe,Wher-where have you been?
331,Monica,"Well, we had a little fight."
332,Chandler,I would never lie to get someone into bed.
333,Monica,You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy.
334,Monica,"Ooh, uh, thanks."
335,Monica,"Wow, little tight, isn't it?"
336,Monica,How d'you get a bigger table?
337,Monica,"You-you had a big table, but they made you move."
338,Monica,"Huh-huh, shut up Monica."
339,Monica,"Whoo,  I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck."
340,Chandler,I suppose that Monica will have the  manipulative  shrew.
341,Joey,Why are you going?
342,Joey,"He said, she wanted the shrew!"
343,Ross,"Rach, c'mon, Emma is fine."
344,Ross,You're turning into an obsessive  mother.
345,Ross,"Okay, you need to stop."
346,Rachel,Y'guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to the  beauty salon?
347,Chandler,You mean the lully story?
348,Ross,"Huh-huh, they already know it."
349,Phoebe,"You guys, we've been waiting for you for a long time, maybe  you should order."
350,Joey,"No, no, it's okay, I already told the waiter what  they want."
351,Monica,Why would you do that?
352,Joey,"Chandler, control your woman!"
353,Rachel,"Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would  like to start the celebration and make a toast  to Phoebe."
354,Rachel,She dropped her  sock.
355,Phoebe,Aw  what?
356,Rachel,"N-no, Emma dropped her sock."
357,Monica,Mom's here?
358,Monica,"I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me  she was out of town."
359,Rachel,"Ross, she still has not noticed that the baby's sock is on the  ground."
360,Phoebe,'s a good toast.
361,Rachel,Could you please get her attention?
362,Ross,W-oa  Mommy!
363,Phoebe,"Oh, for god's sake, Judy, pick up the sock!"
364,Phoebe,Pick  up the sock!
365,Phoebe,Pick up the sock!
366,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, was that rude?"
367,Phoebe,"Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt  the hideousness  that is this  evening?"
368,Phoebe,"Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was  have dinner with my friends on my birthday."
369,Phoebe,And you are all so late and you  didn't even have the courtesy to call.
370,Phoebe,"Well, it's too late  now."
371,Ross,"Well, ???"
372,Ross,think that's us?
373,Phoebe,"well, this is, this is, this is not over!"
374,Phoebe,Hello?
375,Joey,"Well, what is going on with you  two?"
376,Monica,"Uch, you see, I'm ovulating."
377,Chandler,"Oh yeah, that's what she says."
378,Chandler,"But maybe you're not  ovulating at all, maybe it's just a clever ruse to get me into bed."
379,Monica,"Yes smokie, that is what it was."
380,Monica,I just can't get enough.
381,Chandler,You not gonna believe
382,Joey,So?
383,Joey,"Did have sex, right?"
384,Chandler,What's the matter with me?
385,Chandler,Why I'm such a girl?
386,Phoebe,"Okay, that was Mike."
387,Rachel,"Phoebe, hi, we're so sorry."
388,Rachel,You're totally right.
389,Rachel,We are here  one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday  celebration.
390,Phoebe,"Mhuh, guys, that means the world to me."
391,Phoebe,"Huh, nkay, I'm gonna  take off."
392,Rachel,What?
393,Phoebe,"Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early."
394,Phoebe,Wait.
395,Phoebe,"Wait, I'm not tnot that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with  her boyfriend."
396,Phoebe,You know what?
397,Phoebe,I am.
398,Phoebe,Bye guys!
399,Phoebe,Judy!
400,Phoebe,Bye.
401,Rachel,"Oh thank god, if Phoebe's going, can we please take Emma  home?"
402,Ross,"You know, I think that's a good ideaour babysitter just pounded  in another Chardonnet."
403,Ross,"Bye, y'guys."
404,Monica,Bye.
405,Joey,See ya.
406,Joey,"Well, this is just us."
407,Joey,Monica &
408,Chandler,Mhum.
409,Monica,"So, I'm, I'm probably still ovulating."
410,Monica,Do you want to give it  another try?
411,Chandler,"So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?"
412,Joey,"Do, do you gonna do it now?"
413,Monica,We don't have much time.
414,Monica,Once the egg descended the oviduct
415,Joey,No-ohoh.
416,Joey,Maitre D'
417,Joey,"Nah, just me."
418,Joey,All alone.
419,Joey,"Dinner for six  for one, uh, you boys are about to see something really special."
420,Joey,Closing Credits
421,Joey,Excellent.
422,Joey,The shrew in particular was exclusive.
423,Joey,Joey!
424,Joey,Joey.
425,Joey,That's the best birthday ever.
426,Joey,End

1,Monica,It's sooo good!
2,Monica,So good for Monica!
3,Chandler,Oh!
4,Chandler,"Look at that, time's up!"
5,Chandler,My turn!
6,Monica,That was a half an hour?
7,Chandler,It's your timer.
8,Monica,"Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!"
9,Chandler,"All right, then massage me up right nice!"
10,Chandler,Ah!
11,Chandler,Ahh!!
12,Chandler,Ahh!
13,Monica,"It's so good, isn't it?"
14,Chandler,It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
15,Monica,Say good-bye to sore muscles!
16,Chandler,Good-bye muscles!!
17,Chandler,Opening Credits
18,Chandler,"I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!!"
19,Chandler,"Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information."
20,Chandler,And I wanted to give it up I justI didn't know what it was!
21,Joey,"Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her."
22,Chandler,"Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship."
23,Chandler,"Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth."
24,Ross,Hey.
25,Joey,"Whoa, dude, look out!"
26,Joey,You almost crushed my hat!
27,Ross,Sorry.
28,Chandler,And the bunny got away.
29,Ross,This would be the place where you explain the hat.
30,Joey,Oh!
31,Joey,"Yeah, look there's this play all right?"
32,Joey,And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy.
33,Joey,A real clothes horse.
34,Joey,"So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff."
35,Chandler,And you're gonna make them all disappear.
36,Joey,"Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this."
37,Chandler,Done.
38,Rachel,"Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store?"
39,Rachel,I'll help you out.
40,Joey,Great!
41,Joey,"Thanks, Rach!"
42,Rachel,Sure!
43,Rachel,"God, please take those off!"
44,Joey,All right.
45,Ross,"Hey Pheebs, how's it going?"
46,Chandler,Hey.
47,Phoebe,Hey!
48,Phoebe,"Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital."
49,Rachel,What?
50,Ross,Is everything okay?
51,Joey,Are you all right?
52,Phoebe,"Oh yeah, no-no-no."
53,Phoebe,I'm fine.
54,Phoebe,"I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died."
55,Joey,Pheebs!
56,Joey,Sorry!
57,Phoebe,"It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life."
58,Phoebe,"And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit."
59,Rachel,"Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?"
60,Phoebe,"Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!"
61,Monica,Guys!
62,Monica,Guys!
63,Monica,I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.
64,Ross,"Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died."
65,Monica,"Ohh my God, I'm so sorry."
66,Phoebe,It's okay.
67,Phoebe,"Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool."
68,Phoebe,"'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins."
69,Monica,Not the way they're doing it.
70,Monica,"What, what happened?"
71,Monica,How did she die?
72,Phoebe,"Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again."
73,Joey,"Pheebs, I'm so sorry."
74,Phoebe,It was really sweet.
75,Phoebe,"The last thing she said to me was; ""Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter."""
76,Phoebe,And y'know what?
77,Phoebe,We will meet at the checkout counter.
78,Rachel,"Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?"
79,Joey,"All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then."
80,Rachel,"Okay, it's missing something."
81,Rachel,"Ooh, I know!"
82,Rachel,"Umm, okay."
83,Joey,Really?
84,Joey,A purse?
85,Rachel,It's not a purse!
86,Rachel,It's a shoulder bag.
87,Joey,It looks like a women's purse.
88,Rachel,"No Joey, look."
89,Rachel,"Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog."
90,Rachel,Look.
91,Rachel,"See look, men, carrying the bag."
92,Joey,"See look, women, carrying the bag."
93,Joey,"But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man."
94,Rachel,Exactly!
95,Rachel,Unisex!
96,Joey,Maybe you need sex.
97,Joey,I had sex a couple days ago.
98,Rachel,No!
99,Rachel,No Joey!
100,Rachel,U-N-I-sex.
101,Joey,"Well, I ain't gonna say no to that."
102,Phoebe,It's Phoebe.
103,Phoebe,"Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?"
104,Phoebe,"Umm, well, umm Grandma died."
105,Phoebe,"No, she just died today!"
106,Phoebe,"Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow."
107,Phoebe,No you didn't!
108,Phoebe,"Well, lots of people!"
109,Phoebe,"Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?"
110,Phoebe,Fine.
111,Phoebe,"Okay, enjoy your concert."
112,Joey,Hey!
113,Chandler,Hey!
114,Chandler,Wow!
115,Chandler,You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
116,Joey,What?
117,Joey,Are you referring to my man's bag?
118,Joey,"At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too."
119,Joey,Check it out!
120,Joey,It's got compartments for all your stuff!
121,Joey,Your wallet!
122,Joey,Your keys!
123,Joey,Your address book!
124,Ross,Your make-up!
125,Rachel,"Joey, what are you doing with the bag?"
126,Rachel,You're audition is not until tomorrow.
127,Joey,"Yeah, but sandwich time is right now."
128,Rachel,"Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it."
129,Joey,Why would I return it?
130,Joey,I love this bag!
131,Rachel,"All right, then you owe me $350."
132,Joey,Fine!
133,Joey,Do you take Vasa or Mustercard?
134,Rachel,Joey
135,Joey,"All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you."
136,Ross,"What's the part, Anti-man?"
137,Rachel,"Hey, don't listen to them."
138,Rachel,I think it's sexy.
139,Joey,U-N-I-sexy?
140,Phoebe,"Well hello, Mrs. Penella!"
141,Phoebe,Thank you so much for coming!
142,Phoebe,"Well, okay look, here's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on."

120,Joey,All right!
121,Joey,Everybody ready to go to the movies?
122,Ross,"Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it."
123,Joey,Really?
124,Ross,"Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book."
125,Ross,I just wanna be alone right now.
126,Joey,Oh.

128,Joey,"Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff."
129,Ross,"That's okay, Joe."
130,Joey,"All right, let's go Pheebs."
131,Ross,Oh God!

134,Monica,"Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!"
135,Chandler,"Okay, easy Martina."
136,Chandler,I think we should let them win the next game.
137,Monica,"I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said."
138,Chandler,Let them win one.
139,Monica,Are you crazy?!
140,Monica,We own those two!
141,Monica,"I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills."
142,Chandler,You're not even giving them a chance!
143,Monica,They have racquets don't they?
144,Chandler,"Oh yes, sir!"
145,Chandler,Put me out of my misery.
146,Chandler,Are you sure you never played pro?
147,Chandler,Please let them win!
148,Monica,I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
149,Chandler,"Oopsey, missed it!"
150,Monica,I got it!
151,Monica,I got it!
152,Chandler,Long!
153,Monica,I can't believe you let them win!
154,Chandler,"Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it."
155,Monica,I was frustrated.
156,Chandler,It was my racquet.
157,Monica,I was frustrated with you!
158,Chandler,If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
159,Monica,Y'know what really bothers me?
160,Monica,Isit's how-how different you act around them!
161,Monica,"I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the ""I'll see you around, Bing!"""
162,Monica,"""Not if I see you first, Doug!"""
163,Monica,"I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler."
164,Monica,Okay?
165,Monica,The guy's a suck-up.
166,Chandler,"Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight."
167,Monica,"I'm telling you, something's wrong!"
168,Monica,My brother does not stay out all night.
169,Joey,Maybe we should check the trash chute.
170,Rachel,Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
171,Joey,"That's right, he almost could."
172,Joey,Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
173,Phoebe,Hey!
174,Rachel,There he is!
175,Monica,Oh my God!
176,Monica,Where the hell have you been?!
177,Ross,"Just, y'know out."
178,Rachel,"Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!"
179,Phoebe,What were you doing?
180,Ross,"I uh, went to a bar."
181,Ross,"And then I just uh, just walked around for a while."
182,Rachel,You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
183,Joey,He hooked up!
184,Joey,He hooked up with someone.
185,Ross,"Look, I don't have to answer your questions!"
186,Ross,Okay?
187,Ross,"I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!"
188,Joey,He hooked up!!

190,Joey,[Suddenly the door opens and Ross's mystery girl enters.
191,Joey,I'll give you a hint to who it
192,Rachel,Yeah!
193,Rachel,No that's what I was thinking.
194,Phoebe,"Oh, nobody's judging you."
195,Ross,"Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say"
196,Phoebe,You two will have very hairy children.
197,Ross,"Okay, I didn't know you would say that."
198,Rachel,Ross!
199,Rachel,Janice?
200,Joey,"All right, hold on!"
201,Joey,Hold on.
202,Joey,Hold on.
203,Joey,"This is Ross, okay?"
204,Joey,He's our friend.
205,Joey,He obviously went crazy.
206,Joey,He obviously lost his mind.
207,Ross,"Look, I didn't lose my mind!"
208,Ross,"Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common!"
209,Ross,We've-we've both been divorced.
210,Ross,We-we both have kids.
211,Phoebe,So are you actually gonna see her again?
212,Joey,Phoebe!
213,Joey,Don't put ideas in his head!
214,Ross,I am gonna see her again.
215,Joey,Damnit Phoebe!
216,Rachel,"Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship!"
217,Rachel,"But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him!"
218,Rachel,"Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest!"
219,Rachel,"Okay, you go!"
220,Monica,My turn?
221,Monica,What-what are you talking about?
222,Rachel,"Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler."
223,Monica,What?
224,Rachel,"I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, ""I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours."""
225,Rachel,"And he said, ""Laundry?"
226,Rachel,"Is that my new nickname?"""
227,Rachel,"And you said, ""No!"
228,Rachel,"You know what your nickname is, Mr."
229,Rachel,"Big."""
230,Monica,Well.
231,Monica,Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach.
232,Monica,Wow!
233,Monica,Let me know how that one turns out.
234,Rachel,"Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone."
235,Monica,"Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Bigot."
236,Rachel,What?
237,Monica,Mr. Bigot.
238,Monica,He tells the most racist jokes.
239,Rachel,All right.
240,Rachel,So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
241,Monica,Me and Chandler?
242,Joey,"All right, put your 20 bucks down."
243,Joey,First one to find the tasty treat wins.
244,Joey,Okay?
245,Phoebe,Uh-hmm.
246,Joey,All right.
247,Joey,Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths.
248,Joey,And they're off!
249,Phoebe,Get your foot off my contestant!
250,Phoebe,Judge!
251,Joey,"Judge rules, no violation."
252,Phoebe,Ohhh.
253,Ross,Hey guys!
254,Phoebe,Hey!
255,Joey,Yeah!
256,Ross,Y'know what?
257,Ross,"It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice!"
258,Joey,What?
259,Phoebe,Are you serious?
260,Ross,Yeah!
261,Ross,I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me.
262,Ross,I mean I talked for hours.
263,Ross,It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
264,Phoebe,"You don't need Janice for that, you've got us."
265,Phoebe,We
266,Joey,And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
267,Phoebe,No!!
268,Phoebe,"Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!"
269,Joey,"Judge rules, Nutter-Butter."
270,Phoebe,"Ohh, tough call."
271,Joey,Yeah.
272,Monica,"Oh, none for me."
273,Monica,Thanks.
274,Chandler,Just a little bit of sugar.
275,Monica,How does that laugh not give you a headache?
276,Chandler,"Oh, you get used to it."
277,Monica,"Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can."
278,Monica,"So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things."
279,Chandler,"So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?"
280,Monica,I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
281,Chandler,Oh.
282,Chandler,What?
283,Chandler,"Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir."
284,Chandler,"Well, I just"
285,Monica,"Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke."
286,Chandler,Really?
287,Monica,Yeah!
288,Monica,"I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it."
289,Monica,"You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay?"
290,Monica,But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically.
291,Monica,You get it now honey?
292,Chandler,I think I do!
293,Chandler,"Thank you, Monica."
294,Monica,I thought you could use the help.
295,Chandler,Coffee in a fight!
296,Joey,Hey Rach!
297,Joey,"Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?"
298,Rachel,Sure!
299,Rachel,Why?
300,Joey,"Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate."
301,Rachel,What?!
302,Rachel,She just called and said that she was gonna be working late!
303,Rachel,She keeps lying to me!
304,Rachel,That's it!
305,Rachel,Y'know what?
306,Rachel,I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
307,Chandler,"All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?"
308,Monica,Sorry!
309,Monica,I'm justI'm not very good at this!
310,Monica,I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
311,Chandler,But we're not ready to tell yet!
312,Monica,I know!
313,Monica,It's just thatever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too.
314,Monica,Y'know?
315,Monica,I miss that so much now.
316,Monica,She's my best friend.
317,Monica,Joey?!
318,Monica,"Oh my God, Rachel!"
319,Rachel,Hey!
320,Rachel,Hi!
321,Monica,Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
322,Monica,(She tries to pull her shirt down to cover the fact that she's wearing men's boxers.]
323,Rachel,"Well, I was actuallyI-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp."
324,Rachel,"To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better."
325,Monica,Okay great!
326,Rachel,Yeah!
327,Monica,Great!
328,Monica,"Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it!"
329,Monica,"In fact, he pays me to clean it!"
330,Rachel,Oh!
331,Rachel,What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
332,Monica,"Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work."
333,Rachel,That's good enough.
334,Rachel,Right?
335,Rachel,"Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my books!"
336,Monica,Okay.
337,Rachel,Okay.
338,Monica,I'll get back to my new job.
339,Rachel,'Kay.
340,Rachel,Congratulations on your new job.
341,Chandler,"Man, she is really gullible."
342,Ross,Thanks!
343,Ross,Are you sure?
344,Ross,Because I can stay out as late as you want.
345,Ross,"I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?"
346,Ross,Oh
347,Ross,This isn't what I ordered!
348,Ross,Man!
349,Ross,Can anything go right in my life?!
350,Ross,First my marriage falls apart and then
351,Ross,Okay.
352,Ross,Sometimes I feel
353,Ross,Huh?
354,Ross,"Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney?"
355,Ross,"So you're saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you, Janice."
356,Ross,OHMYGOD!
357,Ross,I am now.
358,Joey,"Umm, hi."
359,Ross,"Dude, we got to talk."
360,Chandler,Okay.
361,Ross,"I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice."
362,Ross,What you're-you're not mad?
363,Chandler,Why would I be mad?
364,Ross,"Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff."
365,Ross,"You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to."
366,Chandler,I am mad!
367,Chandler,But you know what I'm gonna do?
368,Chandler,I'm gonna forgive you!
369,Chandler,Because that's what friends do!
370,Chandler,"They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there."
371,Chandler,"Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you."
372,Ross,Okay.
373,Chandler,I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
374,Ross,All right.
375,Chandler,"And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty  seven dollars."
376,Chandler,No strings attached.
377,Chandler,"Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it downlet's write it down!"
378,Chandler,End

8,Joey,"Yeah, he's the best."

21,Ross,You owe it to yourself.
22,Joey,It's Rachel.
23,Ross,"Did you umI'm sorry, did you just say it's Rachel?"
24,Joey,Yes.
25,Ross,"Um, youyou like Rachel?"
26,Joey,Yes.
27,Joey,I like Rachel.
28,Ross,Rachel?
29,Joey,"Yeah, okay but look, buy uhHey-hey, y'know, y'know who else I like?"
30,Joey,You!
31,Joey,And it-it doesn't get said enough.
32,Joey,I like you Ross.
33,Ross,But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?
34,Joey,"Yeah, but it's not a big deal."
35,Ross,It's not a big deal?
36,Ross,"Oh, I'm sorry I justum, Iwhat about all the stuff you-you just said?"
37,Ross,"I mean how about, I likeyou-you can't stop thinking about her."
38,Ross,Like how you can't sleep?
39,Joey,"I'm an actor, y'know?"
40,Joey,"As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic."
41,Ross,Rachel who's carrying my baby?
42,Ross,Rachel?
43,Joey,"Look no, I-I know it's bad, and I know it's wrong."
44,Joey,Okay?
45,Joey,But-but it's not like anything's ever gonna happen.
46,Joey,Y'know?
47,Joey,"These-these are just feelings, they're gonna go away."
48,Ross,Y'know what?
49,Ross,I-I gotta go.
50,Joey,Oh come on Ross!
51,Joey,Hey Ross-Ross don't
52,Ross,I justy'knowI-I just have oneRachel?
53,Rachel,Oh-oh!
54,Rachel,"Okay, she's kicking!"
55,Chandler,Oh!
56,Chandler,She's growing inside you.
57,Rachel,Whoa!
58,Chandler,Oh!
59,Rachel,Wow that was a big one.
60,Chandler,I think that's the youngest girl ever to reject me.
61,Phoebe,Oh hey you guys!
62,Chandler,Oh hey!
63,Rachel,Hi!
64,Phoebe,"Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?"
65,Rachel,Oh yes I do.
66,Rachel,I do.
67,Rachel,I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone.
68,Rachel,And do you know how you find him?
69,Rachel,You stop looking for him.
70,Rachel,That's why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe.
71,Rachel,He'll find me.
72,Phoebe,"Uh-huh,  and you?"
73,Chandler,No.
74,Chandler,"I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don't think they exist."
75,Phoebe,"Okay, good."
76,Chandler,Why?
77,Phoebe,"Well last night, I met Monica's."
78,Chandler,What?
79,Phoebe,"Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half."
80,Chandler,"Come on, don't be crazy."
81,Chandler,"You don't think there's someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya?"
82,Rachel,"Well, what's he like?"
83,Phoebe,Well he's tall.
84,Rachel,Uh-huh.
85,Phoebe,He has brown hair.
86,Rachel,"Of course, of course."
87,Chandler,"A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!"
88,Phoebe,He works with food!
89,Rachel,Oh sure.
90,Rachel,Older?
91,Phoebe,"Obviously, and he's British."
92,Rachel,"Oh, I was just gonna ask!"
93,Phoebe,Yeah?
94,Phoebe,"And, he's-he's so centered and mature and confident."
95,Rachel,"Oh, it's so sad they never had a chance to meet."
96,Chandler,"Luckily, the guy she settled for can't hear what you're talking about."
97,Phoebe,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
98,Phoebe,"Um, and maybe I'm wrong!"
99,Phoebe,"I buty'know I'm gonna go out with him again, I'll find out more."
100,Chandler,You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you're still gonna date him?
101,Phoebe,"Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl's gotta eat."
102,Monica,Hey.
103,Ross,Hey.
104,Monica,"I just talked to Joey, I justI want to see how you were."
105,Ross,"Oh y'know, I stillI can't believe it."
106,Ross,"Joey and Rachel I mean it's It's like you and me going out, only weirder!"
107,Monica,"All right, I know you're hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don't say that again."
108,Ross,Oh my God!
109,Ross,"What if, what if they get married?"
110,Ross,Then he'd be the stepfather of my child.
111,Monica,"Honey, I don't think that's something we need to worry about!"
112,Monica,First of all he's-he's never gonna tell her how he feels about her.
113,Monica,And even if he did you have no idea how she'd react.
114,Ross,"Sure, because women never like Joey."
115,Ross,"Y'know, I think he's a virgin."
116,Monica,Joeyhe's not even thinking about going after Rachel!
117,Ross,He's not?
118,Monica,No!
119,Monica,All he's thinking about is how you're taking this!
120,Monica,"I mean, listen it's totally freaking him out."
121,Monica,He's talking about moving to Vermont.
122,Ross,Why?
123,Monica,He says he wants to leave the country.
124,Monica,He thinks you hate him.
125,Ross,Hate him?
126,Ross,"I No, I don't hate him."
127,Ross,"It's just it's Rachel, y'know?"
128,Monica,Honey I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you.
129,Monica,"But, I don't want you to lose Joey over it."
130,Monica,And right now he just needs to know that you're still his friend.
131,Ross,Okay.
132,Ross,"Okay, I'll talk to him."
133,Monica,All right.
134,Monica,"Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money."
135,Phoebe,Oh!
136,Phoebe,Hi!
137,Monica,Hi!
138,Phoebe,"Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don."
139,Phoebe,Soul mate.
140,Chandler,What?
141,Phoebe,Soul mate.
142,Monica,"So, what have you guys been doing?"
143,Monica,I know!
144,Monica,"What is this, 1985?"
145,Monica,Not really.
146,Chandler,What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?
147,Chandler,On a barbecue chicken pizza?
148,Chandler,No?
149,Monica,"So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?"
150,Monica,Oh my God!
151,Monica,"That's my restaurant, I'm the chef there."
152,Monica,No!
153,Monica,"Oh, I'd like a latte."
154,Monica,Oh y'know what?
155,Monica,"If you're gonna talk about me, I'm gonna go with you."
156,Chandler,What are you doing?
157,Phoebe,Nothing!
158,Phoebe,I swear to God I didn't know you guys would be here!
159,Phoebe,And the good news is you didn't believe in soul mates.
160,Phoebe,So
161,Chandler,"I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!"
162,Phoebe,"They're just talking, and y'know what?"
163,Phoebe,Just because I think they're soul mates doesn't mean anything's gonna happen.
164,Monica,"Phoebe, good work."
165,Phoebe,Yeah?
166,Monica,Yeah!
167,Monica,"Oh he's great, I love him."
168,Phoebe,"Don't worry, we'll find you someone else."
169,Joey,Hey.
170,Ross,Hey.
171,Joey,"Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it."
172,Ross,"No, I don't want to hit you."
173,Joey,Oh what then?
174,Joey,Kick me?
175,Ross,No.
176,Joey,Bite me?
177,Ross,"No, no I don't want to do anything to you."
178,Ross,All right?
179,Ross,I just want to tell you that I'm not mad at you andand that I certainly do not hate you.
180,Ross,"I just, I just came here to say that."
181,Joey,Oh nowHey Ross-Ross!
182,Joey,Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?
183,Ross,Uhyeah sure.
184,Joey,"Do uh, do you got any beer?"
185,Joey,All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left.
186,Joey,I don't
187,Ross,Okay.
188,Joey,"Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay?"
189,Joey,"I uhI am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay?"
190,Joey,I-I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you.
191,Ross,Thank you.
192,Joey,"Anyway, it uhlook it'll justtake me a while to get over her, that's all."
193,Joey,"I'm not even sure how to do that, I mean I've never been in love before so"
194,Ross,What?!
195,Ross,You're in love with her.
196,Joey,"Yeah, I thought you knew that."
197,Ross,"Umm, no."
198,Joey,Wow.
199,Joey,"Hey look, if it helps, I don't want to feel this way."
200,Joey,Honest.
201,Joey,"I just keep thinking, ""Ah, I'll get over this."""
202,Joey,Y'know?
203,Joey,I justIt just keeps gettin' harder.
204,Joey,"I don't, I don't know what to do."
205,Joey,Y'know?
206,Joey,What do I do?
207,Ross,I think you need to tell her how you feel.
208,Joey,Okay that's the green stuff talkin'.
209,Ross,"No, I'm serious."
210,Ross,"You-you need to find out where she is, because if she's not where you are, then you can start to move past this."
211,Joey,But what if uhand I'm not saying she will beBut
212,Ross,If she is where you are then uhthen my feeling weird about it shouldn't stand in the way.
213,Joey,Are you sure?
214,Ross,Yeah.
215,Ross,"Look if-if she's gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn't find a better guy."
216,Ross,So
217,Joey,Hey thanks.
218,Ross,So when do you think you're gonna talk to her?
219,Joey,Oh my God I have to tell her!
220,Joey,I haven't even thought about what I will say.
221,Joey,What should I say?
222,Ross,"I'm understanding, but let's not get carried away."
223,Joey,"I'm sorry, you're right."
224,Joey,What am I gonna say?
225,Joey,Oh!
226,Ross,"Yeah, tell me about it."
227,Ross,Commercial Break
228,Chandler,Cheese you say?
229,Chandler,"That's some pretty smelly work, huh Don?"
230,Chandler,"Cheese, it's smelly."
231,Chandler,You must smell a lot of the time too.
232,Monica,Me too!
233,Monica,"Yeah, Chandler can't stand it."
234,Monica,He won't even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.
235,Monica,You know what I'd love to do?
236,Monica,"I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheeseNot even bread, just cheese."
237,Monica,"No, I want the bread."
238,Monica,Yeah.
239,Monica,"Ah, and pastries  And pate."
240,Monica,"Oh, I'm really not high, it's just I used to be fat."
241,Chandler,Is it made of cheese?
242,Monica,I'd move in tomorrow!
243,Chandler,Oh come on!
244,Chandler,Are you listening to this?
245,Phoebe,I'm so sorry.
246,Chandler,What do we do?
247,Phoebe,"I don't know, they both want to live in a house of cheese!"
248,Phoebe,I don't know how you fight that.
249,Joey,Okay.
250,Joey,"Okay, I can do this."
251,Joey,I can tell her how I feel.
252,Joey,"Just uh, just stand up straight."
253,Joey,Take a couple deep breaths.
254,Joey,Look confident.
255,Rachel,Joey?
256,Rachel,What's up?
257,Joey,"I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something."
258,Rachel,Okay what's up?
259,Joey,Here?
260,Joey,In the hall?
261,Joey,What are we animals?
262,Rachel,"Well honey, I'm late for a meeting."
263,Rachel,So can you just make it quick?
264,Joey,"Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that Iwant to have dinner with you tonight."
265,Joey,That's all.
266,Rachel,Sure!
267,Rachel,That sounds great!
268,Rachel,Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you.
269,Rachel,Okay?
270,Joey,Okay.
271,Joey,That's good.
272,Joey,"Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what you're gonna say."
273,Joey,Good.
274,Joey,Yeah.
275,Joey,Don't you people ever knock?
276,Monica,I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over.
277,Monica,Wouldn't that be nice?
278,Chandler,"Sure, why don't you set it up."
279,Chandler,"I'll just be over here, browsing through the personals."
280,Monica,Are you okay?
281,Monica,You've been acting weird all afternoon.
282,Chandler,"Yeah, fine."
283,Chandler,Fine.
284,Chandler,Not perfect!!
285,Chandler,But good enough.
286,Monica,Jeez!
287,Monica,What is with you?
288,Chandler,"I'm sorry, did you say cheese?"
289,Monica,"All right, what's going on?"
290,Chandler,"Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don't believe in that kind of stuff."
291,Chandler,But then you two totally get along.
292,Chandler,"So look, I won't stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese."
293,Monica,"Chandler, you don't believe in soul mates?"
294,Chandler,No.
295,Chandler,But I'm sure  tomatoes' does.
296,Monica,I don't believe in soul mates either.
297,Chandler,You don't?
298,Monica,No.
299,Monica,I don't think that you and I were destined to end up together.
300,Monica,I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship.
301,Monica,Some days we work really hard.
302,Chandler,So youyou don't want to live with Don in a cheese house?
303,Monica,"No, I've had second thoughts about that."
304,Monica,Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?
305,Chandler,I love you.
306,Monica,I know.
307,Chandler,Y'know what?
308,Chandler,I am going to take you out to dinner tonight.
309,Chandler,I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers .
310,Chandler,No?
311,Chandler,Really?
312,Chandler,They taste so good.
313,Rachel,and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach.
314,Rachel,I mean I'm really worried the baby's not going to like him.
315,Rachel,Are you okay?
316,Joey,What?
317,Joey,Yeah!
318,Joey,Sure!
319,Joey,"Uh, look at the uh, the reasonIs it hot in here?"
320,Rachel,No.
321,Rachel,"Not-not for me, but why don't you take off your sweater?"
322,Joey,"I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs."
323,Rachel,Oh my God!
324,Rachel,Really?!
325,Rachel,Can I see it?
326,Joey,Yeah.
327,Joey,Sure.
328,Rachel,Huh.
329,Rachel,"Wow, I wouldn't think Hobbs would like that so much."
330,Joey,Uh How long have we known each other?
331,Rachel,"Um, sevene-e-eight, eight years."
332,Rachel,Wow.
333,Joey,"Uh-huh, long time."
334,Rachel,Yeah.
335,Joey,But over the past few weeks
336,Joey,"Actually uh, could you give us a second?"
337,Rachel,So you were saying?
338,Joey,I'm not quite sure.
339,Rachel,"Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I said, ""Eight years."""
340,Rachel,"And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and ummnow here we are."
341,Joey,"Yeah, here we are."
342,Joey,Uhh I I think I'mfalling in love with you.
343,Rachel,What?
344,Joey,I'm falling in love with you.
345,Rachel,Who are you talking too?
346,Rachel,"Oh, you're kidding!"
347,Rachel,"Oh, it's a joke!"
348,Rachel,It's funny.
349,Rachel,It's funny.
350,Rachel,I don't get it.
351,Rachel,Oh.
352,Rachel,Okay.
353,Rachel,"Umm I-Iuh, wow."
354,Rachel,Are you uh How did umm When?
355,Joey,Does it really matter?
356,Rachel,Wow!
357,Rachel,Wow.
358,Rachel,Wow.
359,Rachel,"Wow, it is hot in here."
360,Joey,"Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot."
361,Joey,You don't have to say anything.
362,Joey,"You-you uh, you take as much time as you need."
363,Joey,"Okay, you gotta say something!"
364,Rachel,"Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I"
365,Joey,But.
366,Rachel,Joey.
367,Joey,Yeah-yeah right.
368,Joey,That's okay.
369,Joey,That's fine.
370,Joey,"That's uh, pretty much what I was expecting."
371,Joey,"So uh, it's no big deal."
372,Joey,All right?
373,Joey,I think I'm gonna go.
374,Rachel,No!
375,Rachel,Joey please!
376,Rachel,Please don't!
377,Rachel,Please don't leave like this!
378,Rachel,"Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman!"
379,Joey,Don't start doing that.
380,Joey,"You can't do that Rach, cause then you're gonna make me do that."
381,Joey,"Oh, here we go!"
382,Rachel,Can I?
383,Joey,Sure!
384,Rachel,Oh Joey honey I don'tI don't want to lose
385,Joey,"Hey-hey-hey, hey!"
386,Joey,You can't.
387,Joey,Okay?
388,Joey,Ever!
389,Rachel,I'm so sorry.
390,Joey,"Oh no-no Rach, please, don't be sorry."
391,Joey,Okay?
392,Joey,Don't be sorry.
393,Joey,Y'know I was only kidding you.
394,Rachel,"Yeah, that was a real good one."
395,Rachel,Closing Credits
0,Rachel,Coffee.
1,Joey,Thank you.
2,Rachel,Cappuccino.
3,Ross,Grazie.
4,Rachel,And a nice hot cider for Monica.

6,Monica,Uh Rach?
7,Rachel,Yeah?
8,Monica,Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
9,Rachel,Oh!
10,Rachel,That's why.
11,Rachel,I'm sorry!
12,Rachel,Opening Credits
13,Chandler,Mrs. Tedlock.
14,Chandler,You're looking lovely today.
15,Chandler,"And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you."
16,Chandler,Mrs.
17,Chandler,"Oh, listen."
18,Chandler,"If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them."
19,Chandler,Really.
20,Chandler,Nothing at all.
21,Chandler,Really.
22,Chandler,Nothing.
23,Phoebe,Hey you guys!
24,Phoebe,"Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know..."
25,Chandler,Hey!
26,Phoebe,Never mind.
27,Phoebe,But it was going to be really good.
28,Ross,What's going on?
29,Chandler,"So, it's a typical day at work."
30,Chandler,"I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor."
31,Chandler,So....
32,Chandler,I quit.
33,Chandler,Why?
34,Chandler,This was supposed to be a temp job!
35,Monica,"Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years."
36,Chandler,"If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do."
37,Phoebe,So was it a lot more money?
38,Chandler,It doesn't matter.
39,Chandler,I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
40,Rachel,... the WENUS?
41,Chandler,Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems.
42,Chandler,A processing term.
43,Rachel,Oh.
44,Rachel,That WENUS.
45,Joey,So what're you going to do?
46,Chandler,I don't know.
47,Chandler,That's the thing.
48,Chandler,I don't know what I want to do.
49,Chandler,I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
50,Phoebe,Oooh!
51,Phoebe,I have something you can do!
52,Phoebe,I have this new massage client... Steve?
53,Phoebe,"Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef."
54,Monica,Um... hi there.
55,Phoebe,Hi!
56,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah, no, I know."
57,Phoebe,You're a chef.
58,Phoebe,"I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so...."
59,Chandler,Yeah...
60,Chandler,I just don't have that much cheffing experience.
61,Chandler,Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
62,Phoebe,"Yeah, yeah!"
63,Monica,"Well, what kind of food is he looking for?"
64,Phoebe,"Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu."
65,Monica,Oh my God!
66,Phoebe,"Yeah, I know!"
67,Phoebe,"So, what do you think?"
68,Chandler,"Thanks, Phoebe."
69,Chandler,But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
70,Phoebe,OK.  Oh Monica!
71,Phoebe,Guess what!
72,Chandler,Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
73,Rachel,No.
74,Rachel,"But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there."
75,Phoebe,"Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?"
76,Chandler,"Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo."
77,Chandler,"I added the ""a-gogo."""
78,Rachel,Career counselor?
79,Chandler,"Hey, you guys all know what you want to do."
80,Rachel,I don't!
81,Chandler,"Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do."
82,Chandler,"You know, you have goals."
83,Chandler,You have dreams.
84,Chandler,I don't have a dream.
85,Ross,"Ah, the lesser-known ""I don't have a dream"" speech."
86,Monica,"Oh, I love my life, I love my life!"
87,Phoebe,Ooh!
88,Phoebe,Brian's Song!
89,Rachel,The meeting with the guy went great?
90,Monica,So great!
91,Monica,He showed me where the restaurant's going to be.
92,Monica,"It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street."
93,Monica,"Not too big, not too small."
94,Monica,Just right.
95,Chandler,Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
96,Monica,"So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night."
97,Monica,"You know, kind of like an audition."
98,Monica,"And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises."
99,Rachel,What are you going to make?
100,Phoebe,Yummy noises.
101,Rachel,"And Monica, what are you going to make?"
102,Monica,I don't know.
103,Monica,I don't know.
104,Monica,It's just going to be so great!
105,Phoebe,Ooh!
106,Phoebe,I know what you could make!
107,Phoebe,I know!
108,Phoebe,"Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff?"
109,Phoebe,"You know, that thing... with the stuff...?"
110,Phoebe,"OK, I don't know."
111,Ross,"Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?"
112,Joey,How about Tony's?
113,Joey,"If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free."
114,Ross,"OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?"
115,Chandler,Who are you going out with?
116,Phoebe,"Oh, is this the bug lady?"
117,Rachel,Bzzzz....
118,Rachel,"I love you, Ross."
119,Ross,Her name is Celia.
120,Ross,She's not a bug lady.
121,Ross,She's curator of insects at the museum.
122,Rachel,So what are you guys going to do?
123,Ross,"Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey."
124,Chandler,And he's not speaking metaphorically.
125,Joey,"So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe...  huh-huh?"
126,Ross,"Well, I don't know....  huh-huh.... but I'm hoping  huh-huh."
127,Joey,"I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet!"
128,Joey,"She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal."
129,Ross,"Celia, don't worry!"
130,Ross,Don't scream!
131,Ross,He's not going to hurt you!
132,Ross,"Soothing tones, Celia."
133,Ross,Soothing tones!
134,Ross,Marcel...
135,Ross,Alright...
136,Monica,"OK, try this salmon mousse."
137,Joey,Mmmm.
138,Joey,Good.
139,Monica,Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
140,Joey,It's creamier.
141,Monica,"Yeah, well, is that better?"
142,Joey,I don't know.
143,Joey,"We're talking about whipped fish, Monica."
144,Joey,"I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?"
145,Rachel,My God!
146,Rachel,What happened to you?
147,Chandler,"Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?"
148,Chandler,"""You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."""
149,Phoebe,That's so great!
150,Phoebe,'Cause you already know how to do that!
151,Chandler,Can you believe it?
152,Chandler,"I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool?"
153,Chandler,"You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something."
154,Rachel,"Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey!"
155,Rachel,You can see your nipples through this shirt!
156,Monica,"Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up."
157,Chandler,"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you."
158,Monica,It's supposed to be that small.
159,Monica,It's a pre-appetizer.
160,Monica,The French call it an amouz-bouche.
161,Chandler,Well.... it is amouz-ing...
162,Monica,Hello?
163,Monica,"Oh, hi Wendy!"
164,Monica,"Yeah, eight o'clock."
165,Monica,What did we say?
166,Monica,Ten dollars an hour?...
167,Monica,"OK, great."
168,Monica,"All right, I'll see you then."
169,Monica,Bye.
170,Phoebe,Ten dollars an hour for what?
171,Monica,"Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out."
172,Rachel,Waitressing?
173,Joey,Uh-oh.
174,Monica,Well... of course I thought of you!
175,Monica,But... but...
176,Rachel,"But, but?"
177,Monica,"But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know?"
178,Monica,"And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress."
179,Rachel,Oh!
180,Rachel,I see.
181,Rachel,And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
182,Chandler,"You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76."
183,Chandler,Amouz-bouche?
184,Ross,"OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning..."
185,Ross,"Wha... what, here?"
186,Ross,Ah....
187,Ross,Er.... um.....
188,Ross,Um... uh.... vulva.
189,Ross,Commercial Break
190,Joey,Vulva?
191,Ross,"Alright, I panicked, alright?"
192,Ross,She took me by surprise.
193,Ross,"You know, but it wasn't a total loss."
194,Ross,"I mean, we ended up cuddling."
195,Joey,Whoaa!!
196,Joey,You cuddled?
197,Joey,How many times?
198,Ross,Shut up!
199,Ross,It was nice.
200,Ross,I just...
201,Ross,"I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?"
202,Joey,What's the big deal?
203,Joey,You just say what you want to do to her.
204,Joey,Or what you want her to do to you.
205,Joey,Or what you think other people might be doing to each other.
206,Joey,I'll tell you what.
207,Joey,Just try something on me.
208,Ross,Please be kidding.
209,Joey,Why not?
210,Joey,Come on!
211,Joey,"Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now."
212,Ross,OK.
213,Ross,I'm in my apartment...
214,Joey,....yeah... what else?
215,Ross,That's it.
216,Ross,"I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation."
217,Joey,"Alright, look, I'll start, OK?"
218,Ross,"Joey, please."
219,Joey,Come on.
220,Joey,Come on.
221,Joey,"Alright, ready, look!"
222,Joey,Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot.
223,Joey,I want your lips on me now.
224,Ross,Wow.
225,Joey,"Alright, now you say something."
226,Ross,I... ahem...
227,Ross,I really don't think so.
228,Joey,Come on!
229,Joey,"You like this woman, right?"
230,Ross,Yeah.
231,Joey,"You want to see her again, right?"
232,Ross,Sure.
233,Joey,"Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her?"
234,Joey,Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
235,Ross,"OK, turn around."
236,Ross,I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
237,Joey,"Alright, alright."
238,Joey,I'm around.
239,Joey,Go ahead.
240,Ross,Ahem...
241,Ross,"I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips."
242,Joey,There you go!
243,Joey,Keep going.
244,Joey,Keep going!
245,Ross,"I, er..."
246,Ross,I want to take my tongue... and...
247,Ross,....and....
248,Joey,Say it... say it!
249,Ross,...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
250,Chandler,....with?
251,Ross,Funny story!
252,Joey,You're not going to believe this!
253,Chandler,It's OK.
254,Chandler,It's OK.
255,Chandler,I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
256,Joey,"Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again."
257,Chandler,Again?
258,Joey,"And again, and again, and again...  Hello?"
259,Joey,And again.
260,Chandler,Hey Mr. Kostelic!
261,Chandler,How's life on the fifteenth floor?
262,Chandler,"Yeah, I miss you too."
263,Chandler,"Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know?"
264,Chandler,"Well, that's very generous  er, but look, this isn't about the money."
265,Chandler,I need something that's more than a job.
266,Chandler,I need something I can really care about....  And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier?
267,Chandler,"Look, Al, Al..."
268,Chandler,"I'm not playing hardball here, OK?"
269,Chandler,"This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection!"
270,Chandler,No!
271,Chandler,No!
272,Chandler,"No, stop saying numbers!"
273,Chandler,"I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy!"
274,Chandler,You've got the wrong guy!
275,Chandler,I'll see you on Monday!
276,Chandler,Well?
277,Phoebe,Wow!
278,Phoebe,It's huge!
279,Phoebe,It's so much bigger than the cubicle.
280,Phoebe,"Oh, this is a cube."
281,Chandler,Look at this!
282,Phoebe,Oh!
283,Phoebe,You have a window!
284,Chandler,Yes indeedy!
285,Chandler,With a beautiful view of...
286,Phoebe,Oh look!
287,Phoebe,That guy's peeing!
288,Chandler,"OK, that's enough of the view."
289,Chandler,"Check this out, look at this."
290,Chandler,"Sit down, sit down."
291,Phoebe,OK.
292,Chandler,This is great!
293,Chandler,"Helen, could you come in here for a moment?"
294,Chandler,"Thank you Helen, that'll be all."
295,Chandler,"Last time I do that, I promise."
296,Monica,"Wendy, we had a deal!"
297,Monica,"Yeah, you promised!"
298,Monica,Wendy!
299,Monica,Wendy!
300,Monica,Wendy!
301,Rachel,Who was that?
302,Monica,Wendy bailed.
303,Monica,I have no waitress.
304,Rachel,Oh... that's too bad.
305,Rachel,Bye bye.
306,Monica,Ten dollars an hour.
307,Rachel,No.
308,Monica,Twelve dollars an hour.
309,Rachel,Mon.
310,Rachel,"I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around."
311,Monica,"You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you."
312,Monica,"I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you...  twenty dollars an hour."
313,Rachel,Done.
314,Rachel,Well hello!
315,Rachel,Welcome to Monica's.
316,Rachel,May I take your coat?
317,Monica,Hi Steve!
318,Monica,This is Rachel.
319,Phoebe,Mmmmmm!
320,Phoebe,Everything smells so delicious!
321,Phoebe,"You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of  of, OK, smells."
322,Monica,"Oh, thank you."
323,Monica,Would you like a tour?
324,Rachel,What's up?
325,Phoebe,"In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie."
326,Rachel,What?
327,Phoebe,Smoked a joint?
328,Phoebe,"You know, lit a bone?"
329,Phoebe,Weed?
330,Phoebe,Hemp?
331,Phoebe,Ganja?
332,Rachel,"OK, OK."
333,Rachel,"I'm with you, Cheech."
334,Rachel,OK.
335,Rachel,"Let me, let me get you some wine!"
336,Monica,"Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course."
337,Monica,"OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger."
338,Monica,I'm so glad you liked them!
339,Monica,"Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these."
340,Monica,"But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets."
341,Rachel,Excuse me?
342,Rachel,Can I help you with anything?
343,Monica,You know that?
344,Monica,You don't want to spoil your appetite.
345,Monica,"You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes..."
346,Monica,"No, we don't."
347,Monica,Why don't you just have a seat here?
348,Monica,OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
349,Monica,Give them to me.
350,Monica,"No, give me the..."
351,Monica,That's it!
352,Monica,Dinner is over!
353,Monica,What?
354,Monica,Why?
355,Monica,"It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?"
356,Joey,What a tool!
357,Rachel,You don't want to work for a guy like that.
358,Ross,Yeah!
359,Monica,I know... it's just...
360,Monica,"I thought this was, you know... it."
361,Ross,"Look, you'll get there."
362,Ross,You're an amazing chef.
363,Phoebe,Yeah!
364,Phoebe,You know all those yummy noises?
365,Phoebe,I wasn't faking.
366,Joey,"So, er... how did it go with Celia?"
367,Ross,"Oh, I was unbelievable."
368,Joey,"All right, Ross!"
369,Ross,I was the James Michener of dirty talk.
370,Ross,It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard.
371,Ross,"I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers."
372,Joey,Whoa!
373,Joey,And the...  huh-huh?
374,Ross,"Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh..."
375,Joey,You cuddled.
376,Ross,"Yeah, which was nice."
377,Phoebe,You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
378,Rachel,"Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?"
379,Joey,"Yeah, where the hell is he?"
380,Chandler,"Yes, Fran."
381,Chandler,"I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!..."
382,Chandler,"Oh, really, really, really?"
383,Chandler,"Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it!"
384,Chandler,You got it?
385,Chandler,Good!
386,Chandler,Whooooaaaa....
387,Chandler,Closing Credits
388,Phoebe,How's this?
389,Phoebe,Sorry.
390,Phoebe,How about over here?
391,Phoebe,"See, that just means it's working."

394,Phoebe,There you go!
395,Phoebe,End

1,Phoebe,I-I can't find anything that I want to eat!
2,Phoebe,Everything I eat makes me nauseous!
3,Phoebe,"I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cakeooh!"
4,Phoebe,Cake!
5,Phoebe,No.
6,Monica,"Aww, honey I'm sorry."
7,Phoebe,God!
8,Phoebe,Ooh!
9,Phoebe,What is that smell?
10,Phoebe,It's coming from the bathroom.
11,Phoebe,Ooh!
12,Chandler,Wow!
13,Chandler,Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
14,Joey,Yeah?
15,Phoebe,It's me.
16,Phoebe,It's Phoebe.
17,Phoebe,"Listen there's something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?"
18,Joey,Is it the shampoo?
19,Joey,It's guava.
20,Phoebe,No!
21,Joey,Oh!
22,Joey,Wait-wait!
23,Joey,Is it my bologna sandwich?
24,Phoebe,Yes.
25,Phoebe,Yes.
26,Phoebe,Yes.
27,Phoebe,I can't believe it!
28,Phoebe,The baby wants bologna!
29,Phoebe,Maybe he wants me to eat meat?
30,Phoebe,I can't eat meat!
31,Joey,"Oh, wait-wait!"
32,Joey,Maybe it's a pickle?!
33,Joey,Opening Credits
34,Chandler,What are you writing?
35,Rachel,"Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow and since I don't have the guts to ask him out, I'm going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket."
36,Chandler,Oh yeah?
37,Chandler,"Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you  never go out of stylewhat did you throw away?"
38,Chandler,Hi guys!
39,Joey,"Hey, what have you guys been up too?"
40,Ross,"Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum."
41,Chandler,Without me?
42,Ross,Yeah.
43,Monica,"I don't know how museums work in England but, here, you're not supposed to take stuff."
44,Ross,Bye.
45,Joey,Wow!
46,Joey,You guys seem to be having a good time.
47,Ross,"Oh yeah, she's-she's amazing."
48,Ross,And-and she's so much fun.
49,Ross,And!
50,Ross,Y'know what?
51,Ross,"When I'm with her, I'm fun!"
52,Ross,I even signed up for helicopter classes.
53,Ross,"She's leaving in two days, I don't have to do it."
54,Monica,"Oh no, two days, you must be bummed."
55,Ross,"Yeah, she's got to go back to London."
56,Ross,But you know what?
57,Ross,I've been prepared for this from the start.
58,Ross,"We both knew we had two weeks together, and that's it."
59,Ross,Y'know.
60,Joey,Hey that's what all my relationships are like.
61,Chandler,"Yes, but in Ross's case, they both know in two weeks that's it."
62,Ross,Pheebs!
63,Ross,Hello!
64,Ross,Hello!
65,Phoebe,Yes!
66,Phoebe,I know!
67,Phoebe,I know!
68,Phoebe,Yeah!
69,Phoebe,So the baby is totally craving meat.
70,Phoebe,"This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y'know?"
71,Phoebe,And I got nauseous.
72,Chandler,Maybe that's because soy-burgers suck!
73,Phoebe,Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
74,Joey,"Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow."
75,Phoebe,That's sweat.
76,Phoebe,"You throw up all morning, you'll have that glow too."
77,Rachel,"Oh, here's that trench-coat that you wanted."
78,Rachel,Yeah?
79,Rachel,"Oh no-no, no-no, they don't want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store."
80,Rachel,"Well, that's because of a lot of"
81,Rachel,I know!
82,Rachel,Oh?
83,Rachel,"Well, congratulations, so do you love her?"
84,Rachel,Huh.
85,Rachel,"Well, uh, that's uh, that's interesting."
86,Rachel,"Oh, it's just an anti-theft device."
87,Rachel,"You need that, you need that too cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up."
88,Rachel,"Oops, sorry."
89,Rachel,"Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight!"
90,Rachel,"Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans."
91,Chandler,What are you talking about?
92,Joey,"Yeah, what' going on?"
93,Rachel,We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily.
94,Rachel,But it's actually for Joshua.
95,Rachel,"Look, he said he's not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!"
96,Ross,"Well, as much as I'd like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren't going to be here."
97,Ross,All right?
98,Ross,"I mean, she's going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I've got a whole special evening planned."
99,Ross,"So I'm sorry, no party."
100,Joey,Awwww!
101,Rachel,Surprise!!!
102,Rachel,Chandler and
103,Joey,Surprise!
104,Rachel,"Well, it was all Ross's idea."
105,Ross,You really didn't know?
106,Chandler,Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there?
107,Rachel,"Uhh, because I'm trying to play hard to get."
108,Rachel,"Oh, quick he's looking over here, say something funny."
109,Chandler,Like what?
110,Joey,What-what-what is so funny?
111,Chandler,"I said, ""Like what?"""
112,Joey,Now that's a thinker.
113,Rachel,"Okay, y'know what, y'know what?"
114,Rachel,This playing hard to get thing is not working.
115,Rachel,"Umm, hand-hand me those cherries."
116,Rachel,Okay.
117,Rachel,Okay.
118,Rachel,Hi!
119,Rachel,Care for a cherry?
120,Rachel,No?
121,Rachel,"Y'know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue."
122,Ross,So we should probably get going soon.
123,Ross,"Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y'know, then The Plaza for dinner."
124,Ross,"No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short."
125,Ross,"It's usually, ""Surprise!"""
126,Ross,"And then, ""Oh my God, I'm so surprisedgood-bye!"""
127,Ross,Monica said that did she?
128,Phoebe,"Ooh, yeah."
129,Phoebe,Then what are you going to put on top of that?
130,Joey,A little salami.
131,Phoebe,Ooh yeah!
132,Phoebe,"Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?"
133,Joey,Pastrami.
134,Phoebe,"Oooh, yeah."
135,Phoebe,You're a genius.
136,Rachel,"Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?"
137,Joey,Yeah.
138,Rachel,Up!
139,Monica,You changed?
140,Rachel,"Yeah, I did."
141,Rachel,I needed my lucky dress.
142,Monica,"And lucky means, more cleavage?"
143,Chandler,Does for me.
144,Rachel,"Ohh, God!"
145,Rachel,"Look at him, he's so cute."
146,Rachel,"I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him!"
147,Rachel,How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?
148,Joey,Oh!
149,Joey,"I know how you can get him, take off your bra."
150,Rachel,What?
151,Joey,There was a seen in Footloose...
152,Chandler,Flashdance.
153,Joey,"Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl"
154,Chandler,She was a welder.
155,Joey,What?
156,Joey,"Were you like in the movie, or Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve."
157,Joey,"Very sexy, and classy."
158,Monica,"Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe."
159,Rachel,It's not Christmas!
160,Monica,Or Spin the Bottle?
161,Rachel,He's not 11!
162,Rachel,What?
163,Rachel,You're leaving?
164,Ross,"Yes, we have something we have to get to."
165,Rachel,No!
166,Rachel,You guys can't leave yet!
167,Rachel,"You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!"
168,Ross,What big thing?
169,Rachel,"So, Spin the Bottle works like"
170,Joey,Welcome to America.
171,Monica,Two in a row!
172,Monica,You've got to use your tongues now!
173,Rachel,Yay!
174,Rachel,Emily!
175,Chandler,What are the odds?
176,Chandler,What are the odds?
177,Ross,"Okay, that-that's enough!"
178,Ross,"Y'know, let's, let's let someone else play."
179,Joey,"If you didn't want to play, why did you come to the party?"
180,Rachel,"Okay, my turn!!"
181,Rachel,"Rachel squeals in delight and starts a slow sexy crawl over to Joshua, making sure he and everyone else watching gets a good look at her cleavage.)"
182,Phoebe,Oh my God!!
183,Phoebe,The baby just kicked!
184,Rachel,It's okay!
185,Rachel,It's okay!
186,Rachel,"It kicked once, it'll kick again!"
187,Rachel,"All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting."
188,Rachel,Just a bug.
189,Rachel,Commercial Break
190,Phoebe,Y'know it doesn't matter how much I'm craving it.
191,Phoebe,Y'know why I'm never gonna eat meat?
192,Phoebe,"Because it's murder, cold blooded murder."
193,Chandler,Okay.
194,Chandler,There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!
195,Joey,"Phoebe, what-what are you doing?"
196,Phoebe,I can't help it.
197,Phoebe,I need the meat.
198,Phoebe,The baby needs the meat.
199,Joey,"All right look, y'know how-y'know how when you're dating someone and you don't want to cheat on them, unless it's with someone really hot?"
200,Phoebe,"Yeah, totally!"
201,Joey,All right.
202,Joey,Okay.
203,Joey,Well this is the same kind of deal.
204,Joey,"If you're going to do something wrong,  do it right!"
205,Joey,Feel better now?
206,Phoebe,"Yeah, but at what cost?"
207,Phoebe,"Six more months, three meals a day, I'm gonna eat like, y'know millions of cows."
208,Joey,"Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise."
209,Phoebe,What?
210,Joey,"Well, I eat a lot of meat right?"
211,Phoebe,Yeah.
212,Joey,"Well, suppose until the baby's born I laid off it."
213,Joey,"No extra animals would die, you-you'd just be eating my animals."
214,Phoebe,"Joey, I can't believe you would do that for me."
215,Joey,Absolutely!
216,Joey,I could be a vegetarian.
217,Joey,"There's no meat in beer, right?"
218,Ross,"Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away."
219,Monica,Oh my God!
220,Monica,Have you lost your mind?
221,Rachel,No-n-n-n-no!
222,Rachel,I am finally thinking clearly.
223,Rachel,"My lucky dress wasn't working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed."
224,Monica,"Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can't let, actually I kinda want to see what happens."
225,Rachel,Hi!
226,Rachel,"Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye cheer."
227,Rachel,So okay!
228,Rachel,Ready!
229,Rachel,Okay!
230,Rachel,Gimme an E!'
231,Rachel,Gimme an M!'
232,Rachel,Gimme an I!'
233,Rachel,Gimme an L!'
234,Rachel,Gimme a Y!'
235,Rachel,What do you get?
236,Rachel,Emily!!
237,Rachel,EmilWhoa!!
238,Rachel,Okay!
239,Rachel,So that's me as a cheerleader!
240,Rachel,Ta-dum!
241,Rachel,Joey and
242,Monica,Are you all right?
243,Rachel,I'm fine!
244,Rachel,I'm fine!
245,Rachel,"I'm just losing a tooth, it's no big deal."
246,Rachel,I have a dentist!
247,Rachel,Y'know.
248,Rachel,I'm gonna go put some ice on it.
249,Rachel,Excuse me.
250,Rachel,What do I do now?
251,Rachel,What do I do now?
252,Monica,I think you're done.
253,Joey,"Okay, time to take off the bra."
254,Joey,Take the bra off.
255,Rachel,"All right, come on, let's go get your coat."
256,Rachel,"Oh, yeah!"
257,Rachel,Real fun.
258,Rachel,"Y'know, this bra Really, bothers me."
259,Rachel,"Y'know, this used to be my bedroom."
260,Rachel,Yeah.
261,Rachel,"A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories."
262,Rachel,"If these walls could talk, y'know what they'd say?"
263,Rachel,Wanna hear some memories?
264,Rachel,Oh no-no-no!
265,Rachel,"No, I got this all under control."
266,Rachel,Ughhhh!!
267,Rachel,Forget it!
268,Rachel,"This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen."
269,Rachel,Can you not look at me when I say this?
270,Rachel,"I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you."
271,Rachel,"Well, I'm sorry, I thought you needed them!"
272,Rachel,Why?
273,Rachel,You like me?
274,Rachel,Yeah but-but-but you liked me!
275,Rachel,"Oh my God, I can't believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!"
276,Rachel,Oh no-no-no don't say but!
277,Rachel,"No-no, but's never good!"
278,Rachel,"Let's just leave it at, you like me and I like you."
279,Rachel,"Oh, now see that's a fancy but."
280,Rachel,But.
281,Rachel,Okay.
282,Rachel,"Ohh, here you are."
283,Rachel,I was looking for you before.
284,Rachel,Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.
285,Ross,That's okay.
286,Ross,"She's still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it's too late to do any of the things I had planned, so"
287,Rachel,"Oh, Ross, I'm sorry."
288,Rachel,I completely ruined your evening.
289,Ross,Yeah.
290,Rachel,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself."
291,Ross,Helps a little.
292,Rachel,Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
293,Ross,"Yeah, have a seat."
294,Rachel,I'm so sorry.
295,Ross,"That's okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn't want it to end this way, y'know?"
296,Rachel,"Well, maybe you didn't want it to end?"
297,Ross,What do you mean?
298,Rachel,You seem to really like her.
299,Ross,"Yeah, I really do."
300,Ross,"Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment."
301,Rachel,"Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks."
302,Ross,You think?
303,Rachel,"Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip."
304,Ross,"Hey, you're right."
305,Rachel,Yeah.
306,Ross,Thanks.
307,Ross,What photo album was it?
308,Rachel,"I don't know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids."
309,Ross,Oh my God!
310,Ross,"Those weren't albino kids, that was computer camp!"
311,Ross,Rach!
312,Rachel,Hey.
313,Chandler,Hey.
314,Rachel,"You're a pathetic loser, right?"
315,Chandler,"Oh-ho, yeah!"
316,Rachel,Sit!
317,Rachel,"Oh my gosh, Joshua!"
318,Rachel,They're not true?
319,Rachel,Oh.
320,Rachel,Oh!
321,Rachel,"Oh, I love that but."
322,Rachel,You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
323,Rachel,Okay.
324,Rachel,Every time.
325,Rachel,Closing Credits
326,Joey,"Oooh, what you got there?"
327,Phoebe,Pastrami.
328,Joey,"Oh-ho-ho, yeah!"
329,Joey,Hey!
330,Joey,Y'know what goes good with that?
331,Phoebe,"Hm-mm, corn beef."
332,Joey,"Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that's much better."
333,Joey,How about a little of that smoked turkey?
334,Phoebe,Okay.
335,Joey,Oh mama!
336,Joey,Uh when-when is the baby due?
337,Phoebe,Six months.
338,Joey,Ugh.
339,Joey,"Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?"
340,Phoebe,Not if I get there first.
341,Phoebe,End
0,Phoebe,Hi guys!
1,Ross,Hey.
2,Ross,"Oh, oh, how'd it go?"
3,Phoebe,"Um, not so good."
4,Phoebe,He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'
5,Rachel,What?
6,Rachel,"He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?"
7,Monica,"Uh, no."
8,Monica,Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
9,Rachel,Since when?
10,Joey,Since always.
11,Joey,It's like dating language.
12,Joey,"Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'."
13,Chandler,Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
14,Phoebe,"Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'."
15,Rachel,And everybody knows this?
16,Joey,Yeah.
17,Joey,Cushions the blow.
18,Chandler,"Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm."
19,Ross,"That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm."
20,Monica,"Uh, Ross."
21,Ross,What?
22,Ross,Wh- hello?
23,Ross,The Millners' farm in Connecticut?
24,Ross,"The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!"
25,Ross,Opening Credits
26,Chandler,"""So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"""
27,Joey,"""Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over."
28,Joey,"But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."""
29,Chandler,"Hey, that was really good!"
30,Joey,Thanks!
31,Joey,Let's keep going.
32,Chandler,Okay.
33,Chandler,"""So."
34,Chandler,"Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"""
35,Joey,"""I just wanna go back to my cell."
36,Joey,"'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."""
37,Chandler,"""Smoke away."""
38,Chandler,I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
39,Joey,What?
40,Chandler,Relax your hand!
41,Chandler,Not so much!
42,Joey,Whoah!
43,Chandler,Hey!
44,Joey,Hey!
45,Chandler,"Alright, now try taking a puff."
46,Chandler,Alright.. okay.
47,Chandler,No.
48,Chandler,Give it to me.
49,Joey,"No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette."
50,Chandler,"It's fine, it's fine."
51,Chandler,"Look, do you wanna get this part, or not?"
52,Chandler,Here.
53,Chandler,Don't think of it as a cigarette.
54,Chandler,Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand.
55,Chandler,"When you're holding it, you feel right."
56,Chandler,You feel complete.
57,Joey,Y'miss it?
58,Chandler,"Nah, not so much."
59,Chandler,"Alright, now we smoke."
60,Chandler,Oh.. my.. God.
61,Monica,"No, no, no."
62,Monica,They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
63,Joey,That's ridiculous!
64,Ross,Can I use.. either thumb?
65,Rachel,"Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!"
66,Rachel,Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea.
67,Rachel,I'm getting pretty good at this!
68,Rachel,Good for me!
69,Joey,"Y'okay, Phoebe?"
70,Phoebe,"Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank."
71,Monica,What did they do to you?
72,Phoebe,"It's nothing, it's just- Okay."
73,Phoebe,"I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-"
74,Ross,Easy.
75,Phoebe,- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
76,Chandler,"Oh, Satan's minions at work again..."
77,Phoebe,"Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them."
78,Joey,What are you talking about?
79,Joey,Keep it!
80,Phoebe,"It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing."
81,Rachel,"Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!"
82,Phoebe,Okay.
83,Phoebe,"Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes."
84,Phoebe,"Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took?"
85,Phoebe,'Not-mine.
86,Phoebe,Not-mine.
87,Phoebe,Not-mine.'
88,Phoebe,"And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'..."
89,Monica,We're with you.
90,Monica,We got it.
91,Phoebe,Okay.
92,Phoebe,I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it.
93,Phoebe,It would be like this giant karmic debt.
94,Rachel,"Chandler, what are you doing?"
95,Monica,Hey.
96,Monica,Whaddya doing?
97,Ross,What is this?
98,Chandler,I'm smoking.
99,Chandler,"I'm smoking, I'm smoking."
100,Phoebe,"Oh, I can't believe you!"
101,Phoebe,"You've been so good, for three years!"
102,Chandler,And this- is my reward!
103,Ross,"Hold on a second, alright?"
104,Ross,Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
105,Chandler,"Okay, so this time I won't quit!"
106,Chandler,All right!
107,Chandler,"I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out."
108,Phoebe,"Oh, no!"
109,Phoebe,I- I can't drink this now!
110,Monica,Alright.
111,Monica,"I'm gonna go change, I've got a date."
112,Rachel,This Alan again?
113,Rachel,How's it goin'?
114,Monica,"'S'going pretty good, y'know?"
115,Monica,"It's nice, and, we're having fun."
116,Joey,So when do we get to meet the guy?
117,Monica,"Let's see, today's Monday... Never."
118,Monica,No.
119,Monica,Not after what happened with Steve.
120,Chandler,What are you talking about?
121,Chandler,We love Schhteve!
122,Chandler,Schhteve was schhexy!..
123,Chandler,Sorry.
124,Monica,"Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet."
125,Monica,Just give me a chance to figure that out.
126,Rachel,"Well, then can we meet him?"
127,Monica,Nope.
128,Monica,Schhorry.
129,Monica,"I mean, why should I let them meet him?"
130,Monica,"I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him."
131,Monica,"I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd."
132,Monica,I know.
133,Monica,"I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked."
134,Joey,"Let it go, Ross."
135,Ross,"Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi."
136,Monica,Do you all promise?
137,Monica,Chandler?
138,Monica,Do you promise to be good?
139,Joey,"You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!"
140,Ross,"Hey, Pheebs."
141,Phoebe,'Dear Ms. Buffay.
142,Phoebe,Thank you for calling attention to our error.
143,Phoebe,We have credited your account with five hundred dollars.
144,Phoebe,"We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this-  -football phone as our free gift.'"
145,Phoebe,Do you believe this?!
146,Phoebe,"Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!"
147,Rachel,What bank is this?
148,Monica,Hey.
149,Monica,It's him.
150,Monica,Who is it?
151,Joey,Chandler!
152,Joey,He's here!
153,Monica,"Okay, please be good, please."
154,Monica,Just remember how much you all like me.
155,Monica,Hi.
156,Monica,"Alan, this is everybody."
157,Monica,"Everybody, this is Alan."
158,Monica,Thanks.
159,Monica,I'll call you tomorrow.
160,Monica,Okay.
161,Monica,"Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin."
162,Monica,"Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?"
163,Monica,C'mon!
164,Ross,...I'll go.
165,Ross,"Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this."
166,Ross,We loved him.
167,Monica,Wait a minute!
168,Monica,We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
169,Rachel,And did you notice...?
170,Rachel,The
171,Joey,Know what was great?
172,Joey,The way his smile was kinda crooked.
173,Phoebe,"Yes, yes!"
174,Phoebe,Like the man in the shoe!
175,Ross,...What shoe?
176,Phoebe,From the nursery rhyme.
177,Phoebe,"'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'"
178,Ross,...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
179,Rachel,What future boyfriends?
180,Rachel,"Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it."
181,Monica,Really!
182,Chandler,"Oh, yeah."
183,Chandler,I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone.
184,Chandler,"You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?"
185,Ross,"You know what I like most about him, though?"
186,Ross,The way he makes me feel about myself.
187,Monica,Hi.. how was the game?
188,Ross,Well..
189,Monica,Fantastic!
190,Monica,I have one
191,Joey,Alan.
192,Ross,He was unbelievable.
193,Ross,"He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-..."
194,Rachel,"I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team."
195,Chandler,"Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.."
196,Monica,Can I ask you guys a question?
197,Monica,D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
198,Ross,What?
199,Monica,"..I dunno, a little too Alan?"
200,Rachel,"Well, no."
201,Rachel,That's impossible.
202,Rachel,You can never be too Alan.
203,Ross,"Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore."
204,Chandler,I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
205,Phoebe,"Hey, Lizzie."
206,Phoebe,I brought you alphabet soup.
207,Phoebe,Yes.
208,Phoebe,But I left in the Ys.
209,Phoebe,"'Cause, y'know, ""sometimes y""."
210,Phoebe,"Uh, I also have something else for you."
211,Phoebe,"No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?"
212,Phoebe,I know.
213,Phoebe,"No, I want you to have it."
214,Phoebe,I don't want it.
215,Phoebe,"Oh, that's fine, no."
216,Phoebe,No.
217,Phoebe,'Cause you need that.
218,Phoebe,"No, it's okay, thanks."
219,Phoebe,"Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even."
220,Phoebe,Okay?
221,Phoebe,Okay.
222,Phoebe,"No, I'm fine."
223,Phoebe,Huh!
224,Ross,A thumb?
225,Phoebe,I know!
226,Phoebe,"I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!"
227,Chandler,"Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know?"
228,Chandler,"Like, collect all five?"
229,Phoebe,"Does, um, anyone wanna see?"
230,Rachel,It's worse than the thumb!
231,Chandler,"Hey, this is so unfair!"
232,Monica,"Oh, why is it unfair?"
233,Chandler,So I have a flaw!
234,Chandler,Big deal!
235,Chandler,Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?
236,Chandler,"And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?"
237,Chandler,"And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?"
238,Chandler,"I mean, what the hell is that thing?"
239,Chandler,"...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?"
240,Joey,...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
241,Rachel,"Well, I-I could live without it."
242,Joey,"Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?"
243,Ross,"Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing."
244,Joey,"Oh,  ""you do, do you""?"
245,Ross,"You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly."
246,Rachel,"""Indeed there isn't""..."
247,Rachel,I should really get back to work.
248,Phoebe,"Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered."
249,Rachel,Ohh-ho-hooohhh.
250,Rachel,"The hair comes out, and the gloves come on."
251,Monica,Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
252,Monica,"Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like."
253,Monica,Can you believe it?
254,Monica,...Y'know what?
255,Monica,I just don't feel the thing.
256,Monica,"I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing."
257,Monica,I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
258,Monica,"No, he'll be fine."
259,Monica,It's the other five I'm worried about.
260,Joey,Do you have any respect for your body?
261,Ross,Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
262,Chandler,"Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease."
263,Chandler,"The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it."
264,Rachel,Chandler?
265,Rachel,"It's Alan, he wants to speak to you."
266,Chandler,Really?
267,Chandler,He does?
268,Chandler,"Hey, buddy, what's up!"
269,Chandler,"Oh, she told you about that, huh."
270,Chandler,"Well, yeah, I have one now and then."
271,Chandler,"Well, yeah, now."
272,Chandler,"Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before."
273,Chandler,"Well, okay, thanks!"
274,Rachel,"God, he's good."
275,Ross,If only he were a woman.
276,Rachel,Yeah.
277,Chandler,"Ooh, Lambchop."
278,Chandler,How old is that sock?
279,Chandler,If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
280,Ross,Okay.
281,Ross,I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
282,Monica,Hey.
283,Monica,Where's Joey?
284,Chandler,"Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him."
285,Chandler,Do you think that was wrong?
286,Rachel,I think he's across the hall.
287,Monica,Thanks.
288,Ross,There y'go.
289,Chandler,"Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now."
290,Ross,"Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.."
291,Ross,Pheebs?
292,Phoebe,Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
293,Ross,"Hey, I might!"
294,Phoebe,Sorry.
295,Phoebe,"..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb."
296,Phoebe,"And on my way over here, I stepped in gum."
297,Phoebe,...What is up with the universe?
298,Joey,What's going on?
299,Monica,Nothing.
300,Monica,I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
301,Joey,Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
302,Rachel,"Uh, Joey.."
303,Joey,"Oh, God!"
304,Monica,Okay..
305,Monica,"Please, guys, we have to talk."
306,Phoebe,"Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not."
307,Monica,"Alright, we have to talk."
308,Phoebe,There it is!
309,Monica,Okay.
310,Monica,It's-it's about Alan.
311,Monica,There's something that you should know.
312,Monica,"I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.."
313,Monica,I've decided to break up with Alan.
314,Ross,Is there somebody else?
315,Monica,"No, nononono.. it's just.. things change."
316,Monica,People change.
317,Rachel,We didn't change..
318,Joey,So that's it?
319,Joey,It's over?
320,Joey,Just like that?
321,Phoebe,"You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I-"
322,Monica,"Look, I- I could go on pretending-"
323,Joey,Okay!
324,Monica,"-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!"
325,Ross,Who-who wants fair?
326,Ross,"Y'know, I just want things back."
327,Ross,"Y'know, the way they were."
328,Monica,I'm sorry..
329,Chandler,"Oh, she's sorry!"
330,Chandler,I feel better!
331,Rachel,I just can't believe this!
332,Rachel,"I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-"
333,Monica,I'll meet somone else.
334,Monica,There'll be other Alans.
335,Monica,Are you guys gonna be okay?
336,Ross,"Hey hey, we'll be fine."
337,Ross,We're just gonna need a little time.
338,Monica,I understand.
339,Monica,"I'm, I'm really sorry."
340,Monica,Relieved?
341,Rachel,Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?..
342,Rachel,That was fun.
343,Ross,Yeah.
344,Ross,He could row like a viking.
345,Monica,Hi.
346,Ross,So how'd it go?
347,Monica,"Oh, y'know.."
348,Phoebe,Did he mention us?
349,Monica,He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
350,Ross,"You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere."
351,Chandler,...That's it.
352,Chandler,I'm getting cigarettes.
353,Chandler,"I don't care, I don't care!"
354,Chandler,Game's over!
355,Chandler,I'm weak!
356,Chandler,I've gotta smoke!
357,Chandler,I've gotta have the smoke!
358,Phoebe,If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
359,Chandler,"Yeah, alright."
360,Chandler,End
0,Chandler,Hey
1,Joey,Hey.
2,Joey,So where's Mon?
3,Chandler,"Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight."
4,Joey,And you're not helping?
5,Chandler,"I tried, but apparantly singing ""I will survive"" in a helium voice    - not helping."
6,Ross,Hey you guys!
7,Ross,Joey and
8,Chandler,Hey!
9,Chandler,Happy birthday ...
10,Rachel,"Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me."
11,Ross,"Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny."
12,Ross,This is Molly .
13,Ross,"Molly, Chandler, Joey."
14,Ross,Joey and
15,Chandler,Hi.
16,Ross,"Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy."
17,Joey,"You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes."
18,Rachel,"Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside."
19,Rachel,"OK, thank you."
20,Joey,"Yeah, you too."
21,Rachel,"Oh, wow, Molly is just great!"
22,Ross,Yeah.
23,Chandler,"Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny."
24,Rachel,What?
25,Rachel,You really think she's hot?
26,Chandler,Are you kidding?
27,Chandler,If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.
28,Rachel,And Joey?
29,Joey,How do you think she's doing?
30,Rachel,Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot?
31,Rachel,Ross?
32,Ross,"Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot?"
33,Ross,I ....
34,Rachel,Thank you!
35,Chandler,Now that Rachel's gone?
36,Rachel,So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.
37,Rachel,OPENING CREDITS
38,Phoebe,"Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?"
39,Phoebe,No.
40,Phoebe,"It starts with a ""v"" and ends with an ""x""."
41,Phoebe,"Helpfully    with a ""to"" in the middle."
42,Phoebe,What?
43,Phoebe,"Oh, whew, no, that's Bob."
44,Phoebe,"Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who    I put food out for, you know."
45,Phoebe,Kinda like Santa.
46,Phoebe,Except Santa doesn't poop on    the plate of cookies.
47,Phoebe,What are those?
48,Phoebe,"OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob."
49,Phoebe,"So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers."
50,Rachel,Hello.
51,Rachel,"Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma    yesterday during the presentation."
52,Rachel,I really owe you an appology.
53,Rachel,"Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous    and arrogant and obnoxious ..."
54,Rachel,"No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything."
55,Rachel,And    I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.
56,Rachel,Hello.
57,Rachel,"But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf,    I am just really really happy ..."
58,Rachel,"I'm sorry,    obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait    'till it's finished."
59,Rachel,I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!
60,Rachel,"Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep."
61,Rachel,"Oh yeah, I'm jealous."
62,Rachel,"""Oh Gavin, please, please look at    my ass""."
63,Rachel,Stop looking at my ass!
64,Rachel,"I mean, I just    think you are totally inappropriate, ok?"
65,Rachel,"This is a work environment, she's your    subordinate."
66,Rachel,That is totally different for two reasons.
67,Rachel,One - I didn't know    that you knew that.
68,Rachel,"And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had    a deap meaningful relationship."
69,Rachel,It was ...  oh my god.
70,Rachel,He didn't have a last    name.
71,Rachel,"It was just ""Tag""."
72,Rachel,"You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses."
73,Rachel,"Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely    right."
74,Rachel,"You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan!"
75,Rachel,Morgan!
76,Rachel,Tag's last name    was Morgan!
77,Rachel,Huh!
78,Rachel,"Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?"
79,Joey,"Man, I wish I had a nanny like you."
80,Joey,Sure.
81,Monica,Would you stop staring at her?
82,Chandler,I wasn't staring.
83,Chandler,I was leering.
84,Monica,What's the big deal with her?
85,Monica,Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind    of way.
86,Ross,"Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst."
87,Ross,"You know, when it's right there    in your face."
88,Ross,"Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive."
89,Ross,Makes me    feel like I earned it.
90,Chandler,Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
91,Monica,Yeah.
92,Monica,"Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl    for once."
93,Ross,"Ok, I'll be home right after work."
94,Ross,"Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you    - wovyou dovyou ..."
95,Monica,They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.
96,Chandler,"Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma."
97,Rachel,"Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if    you didn't go after her."
98,Joey,Why not?
99,Rachel,"Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything    to, you know, drive her away."
100,Joey,"So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call    her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable?"
101,Joey,"Yeah, sounds    about right."
102,Ross,"Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok?"
103,Ross,"Just - just    forget about her, ok?"
104,Ross,"Just, she's off limits."
105,Joey,"Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for?"
106,Joey,Now that you told    me I can't have it makes me want her even more!
107,Ross,"What are you, a child?"
108,Joey,Yes!
109,Ross,"Joey, come on now, for me!"
110,Ross,"Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy    on someone else."
111,Joey,Fine.
112,Monica,Take me home!
113,Phoebe,Hey Mikey
114,Phoebe,What are you doing?
115,Phoebe,To kill Bob?
116,Phoebe,"No, Mike, I don't want to kill him!"
117,Phoebe,"I thought we were just gonna    capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can    maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl."
118,Phoebe,"I'll find Bob, I'll get him."
119,Phoebe,Bob?
120,Phoebe,Bob!
121,Phoebe,Robert!
122,Phoebe,"Oh wait, I think I hear him."
123,Phoebe,Oh - Oh my god!
124,Phoebe,Bob had babies!
125,Phoebe,Bob's a mom!
126,Phoebe,"I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl."
127,Phoebe,"Oh my god, we killed Bob!"
128,Phoebe,Suzie?
129,Ross,Whazzup?
130,Chandler,"Seriously dude, 3 years ago."
131,Ross,"Listen, can you do me a favor?"
132,Ross,I'm gonna be out today.
133,Ross,"Can you just keep    an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?"
134,Chandler,You don't trust him?
135,Ross,Wh - No.
136,Ross,"Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked    for her daughter, the ""hot nanny""."
137,Chandler,"Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference?"
138,Chandler,Because I could get a job any day now.
139,Ross,You do appear right on the cusp of something.
140,Ross,"Come on man, I'm    sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do    this for me?"
141,Chandler,"Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work."
142,Chandler,"Because you know    as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not,    he's going to have sex with it."
143,Ross,"Well we gotta do something, ok?"
144,Ross,Nannies like her don't grow on trees.
145,Chandler,Picturing that tree?
146,Ross,"I am, yes."
147,Chandler,"Where you going, Joe?"
148,Joey,For a walk.
149,Chandler,Oh.
150,Chandler,You mind if I join you?
151,Joey,"Actually, that will be long."
152,Joey,"You know, I really need to organize    my thoughts."
153,Chandler,Your thoughts?
154,Chandler,Plural?
155,Joey,"Allright, fine, I only have one thought!"
156,Joey,"It's about the hot nanny, I gotta    see her!"
157,Chandler,"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe."
158,Joey,Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her??
159,Joey,You guys are killing me!
160,Joey,She's forbidden fruit!
161,Joey,"It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh?"
162,Joey,Did Ross tell you not to let me go over    there?
163,Chandler,"Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go."
164,Joey,Huh.
165,Joey,Interesting.
166,Joey,Now there are obstacles.
167,Joey,Hot nanny and me against the    world.
168,Joey,This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
169,Chandler,Great novels?
170,Joey,Fine ... mediocre porn
171,Rachel,Rachel Green's office!!
172,Rachel,Give me that phone!
173,Rachel,"Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you?"
174,Rachel,Uh huh ... ok then ...
175,Rachel,I'll    pass you back to your son
176,Rachel,"Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you."
177,Rachel,If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?
178,Rachel,"Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me."
179,Rachel,"In fact,    from now on, I'm going take the high road."
180,Rachel,"And I'm going be very very nice to    you, you ""momma's boy"", starting right now."
181,Monica,Hey Rach!
182,Rachel,Hi!
183,Monica,Ready for your birthday lunch?
184,Rachel,"Yeah I am, I am!"
185,Rachel,"Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce    you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin    Mitchelle."
186,Monica,Pleased to meet you.
187,Monica,So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?
188,Rachel,"Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his    mother."
189,Rachel,Why did you invite him??
190,Rachel,I can't stand that guy!
191,Monica,You were just being so nice to him!
192,Rachel,I was faking it!
193,Rachel,Can't you tell when I'm being fake?
194,Rachel,"Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!"
195,Monica,Right there!
196,Monica,That was so fake!
197,Rachel,Shh!
198,Rachel,I still can't believe you invited Gavin.
199,Rachel,"Allright, he is the    last person I want to see."
200,Monica,"Oh, you're welcome for the party."
201,Monica,I'm glad you're having a good time.
202,Rachel,"God, I hope he doesn't show up."
203,Rachel,"Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy    hates me."
204,Monica,Does he?
205,Rachel,What?
206,Monica,Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you.
207,Monica,It's like in first    grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly    had a crush on me?
208,Rachel,"Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you?"
209,Rachel,"Honey, all those buys had a bet    to see if he can knock you over."
210,Rachel,"Oh, ok, thank you."
211,Rachel,Do you see what all the guys    see in her?
212,Monica,Wouldn't kick her out of bed.
213,Monica,No more Vodka for me!
214,Joey,"Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?"
215,Rachel,"Yeah, sure!"
216,Joey,Oh ...
217,Joey,"Happy birth ...  oh, see you    later"
218,Monica,"Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!"
219,Rachel,"Oh, give me!"
220,Phoebe,"Be careful, be careful!"
221,Phoebe,These are my rat babies!
222,Rachel,"Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?"
223,Monica,So this is what a stroke feels like.
224,Phoebe,I had to bring them!
225,Phoebe,"We killed their mother, they're our responsibility    now."
226,Phoebe,"You know, they require constant care."
227,Phoebe,"You should know that, Rachel, you're    a mother."
228,Rachel,Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?
229,Phoebe,No!
230,Phoebe,Seven rats!
231,Phoebe,"I think we should take them home, we need feed    them."
232,Rachel,"whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?"
233,Phoebe,"Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok?"
234,Phoebe,Not everyone    can afford help.
235,Ross,Where the hell are Joey and Molly?
236,Ross,I asked you to watch them.
237,Chandler,"I'm sorry, I got a little occupied."
238,Ross,We have to stop them before something happens!
239,Chandler,"Right behind you, big guy!"
240,Joey,"So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline."
241,Joey,It takes a lot of hard work.
242,Joey,"Oh, I didn't go to college."
243,Joey,Molly ... people don't study acting ...
244,Ross,"Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?"
245,Ross,Thanx.
246,Joey,Will the stable boy never get the princess?
247,Ross,"What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?"
248,Joey,No ... the leather sticks to my ass.
249,Joey,"You know, this isn't fair."
250,Joey,What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?
251,Joey,Huh?
252,Joey,"Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,    and might want something real?"
253,Joey,"Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this    way about anyone since Rachel, ok?"
254,Joey,I didn't think I could ever love again.
255,Joey,Ross and
256,Chandler,Come on!
257,Chandler,Joe!
258,Joey,Ok
259,Ross,"Yeah, come on in."
260,Ross,Molly?
261,Ross,"Ok ...  Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have    no problem."
262,Joey,It's like my favorite fairy tale come true!
263,Joey,"The    princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!"
264,Phoebe,"Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing    the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed."
265,Phoebe,"Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now."
266,Phoebe,Mate?
267,Phoebe,They're all brothers and sisters.
268,Phoebe,No.
269,Phoebe,wh - get off your sister!
270,Phoebe,"Oh my god, what    are we gonna do?"
271,Phoebe,We have 7 rats.
272,Phoebe,So what if each of them has 7 rats?
273,Phoebe,And then    each of those have 7 rats?
274,Phoebe,That's like ...     That's math I can't even do!
275,Phoebe,What are we gonna do?
276,Phoebe,"Yeah, ok."
277,Phoebe,I guess you're right.
278,Phoebe,"Allright, so we should just give them away."
279,Phoebe,"But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins."
280,Phoebe,They're Bob's    favorites.
281,Phoebe,You must think I'm crazy.
282,Phoebe,Good.
283,Phoebe,"It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go."
284,Phoebe,"I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to    my brother's triplets and I had to give them up."
285,Phoebe,"I haven't    told you about that yet, have I?"
286,Monica,Hey!
287,Rachel,Hi.
288,Rachel,"Thanks for the party, honey."
289,Rachel,Should I help you clean up?
290,Monica,No way!
291,Monica,"You had your party, now I have mine!"
292,Monica,Is everything alright?
293,Rachel,"Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over."
294,Monica,"Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about."
295,Monica,That jerk Gavin from    your office didn't show up .
296,Rachel,Mmm hmm.
297,Monica,"Oh, we weren't talking about you."
298,Monica,"No, no way to recover."
299,Rachel,No.
300,Rachel,"Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at  ..."
301,Monica,"Again, you're welcome."
302,Rachel,"Oh, you bought me a present!"
303,Rachel,Why?
304,Rachel,Aww.
305,Rachel,"Well, ok, well that's very nice."
306,Rachel,And you wrote a card .
307,Rachel,"""From Gavin"""
308,Rachel,"Awww, awww, it's beautiful."
309,Rachel,"See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy."
310,Rachel,Why did you give me such    a hard time?
311,Rachel,Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.
312,Rachel,You do?
313,Rachel,See?
314,Rachel,"Why, Gavin, why?"
315,Rachel,"Right when I'm about to change my opinion    of you, you go and you ...  and you do that ...   ENDING CREDITS"

19,Monica,"Uh-huh, that one!"
20,Rachel,"Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair."
21,Rachel,I'm just gonna grab a jacket.
22,Rachel,"When I get back, I want every little detail."
23,Rachel,Maybe that's him.
24,Monica,"Okay, umm, okay, umm  It's just Joey and Ross."
25,Rachel,Why aren't you guys at the movie?
26,Joey,"Well, we were!"
27,Joey,But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!
28,Ross,I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
29,Joey,He's talking to London!
30,Monica,But why?!
31,Monica,Did he get in touch with Emily?
32,Joey,"Well no, not yet."
33,Joey,He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
34,Ross,"I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!"
35,Joey,Ross!
36,Joey,Way to suck up to the family.

52,Phoebe,"Ugh, what's right with them?"
53,Joey,"Why don't you like PBS, Pheebs?"
54,Phoebe,"Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally."
55,Phoebe,"So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid!"
56,Phoebe,No one ever wrote back.
57,Chandler,Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
58,Phoebe,All I got was a lousy key chain!
59,Phoebe,And by that time I was living in a box.
60,Phoebe,I didn't have keys!
61,Joey,"I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed."
62,Joey,Like-like you did with the babies.
63,Phoebe,"This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV!"
64,Phoebe,This is totally selfish.
65,Joey,Whoa!
66,Joey,Whoa!
67,Joey,Whoa!
68,Joey,"What about you, having those babies for your brother?"
69,Joey,Talk about selfish!
70,Phoebe,What-what are you talking about?
71,Joey,"Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?"
72,Phoebe,Yeah.
73,Phoebe,So?
74,Joey,"It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish."
75,Joey,"Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry."
76,Phoebe,Yes there are!
77,Phoebe,There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
78,Joey,"Well, may I ask for one example?"
79,Phoebe,"Yeah, it's Y'know there'sno you may not!"
80,Joey,That's because all people are selfish.
81,Phoebe,Are you calling me selfish?
82,Joey,Are you calling you people?
83,Joey,"Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist."
84,Joey,Okay?
85,Joey,And you the deal on Santa Clause right?
86,Phoebe,I'm gonna find a selfless good dead.
87,Phoebe,"I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius."
88,Ross,Hello.
89,Ross,Emily?
90,Ross,Emily!
91,Ross,Oh my God!
92,Ross,"Oh my God, it's Emily!"
93,Ross,It's Emily everyone!
94,Ross,Shush-shush-shhst!
95,Ross,Hi!
96,Ross,No wait!
97,Ross,"Look, wait!"
98,Ross,"Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling!"
99,Ross,"I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!"
100,Ross,Look you're my wife.
101,Ross,We're-we're married.
102,Ross,Y'know?
103,Ross,I-I love you.
104,Ross,I-I really miss you.
105,Ross,She's talking.
106,Phoebe,"Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?"
107,Joey,That he doesn't exist.
108,Phoebe,Right.
109,Rachel,"So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?"
110,Chandler,"Uhh, yeah."
111,Chandler,"She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him."
112,Rachel,"So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?"
113,Monica,"Ohh, he's really shy."
114,Monica,I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
115,Chandler,"Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet."
116,Rachel,I don't care!
117,Rachel,I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
118,Chandler,Really?!
119,Chandler,That's what you heard?
120,Chandler,You said that?
121,Monica,I might've said that.
122,Monica,Why is that funny?
123,Chandler,Because I'm very happy for him!
124,Chandler,"And you, you lucky dog!"
125,Ross,Hi!
126,Monica,Hey!
127,Ross,"Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship."
128,Chandler,Yes!
129,Monica,That's great!
130,Ross,In London!
131,Monica,What?
132,Ross,She wants me to move to London.
133,Monica,But you live here!
134,Monica,You know that.
135,Rachel,What-what-what are you gonna do?
136,Ross,I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.
137,Monica,"Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife."
138,Ross,It could happen.
139,Joey,How ya doin'?
140,Joey,Welcome.
141,Joey,Good to see ya!
142,Joey,Stage
143,Joey,That's great.
144,Joey,"But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls."
145,Joey,Stage
146,Joey,But I'm the host!
147,Joey,Stage
148,Joey,You don't seem to understand.
149,Joey,"See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray."
150,Joey,Stage
151,Phoebe,I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed!
152,Phoebe,Y'know that old guy that lives next to me?
153,Phoebe,"Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop."
154,Phoebe,But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies.
155,Phoebe,Then I felt wonderful.
156,Phoebe,That old jackass!
157,Rachel,Maybe Joey's right.
158,Rachel,Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
159,Phoebe,I will find a selfless good deed!
160,Phoebe,'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
161,Chandler,"Hey, Monica?"
162,Chandler,Can I ask you a cooking question?
163,Monica,Sure!
164,Chandler,"If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?"
165,Rachel,Chandler!
166,Rachel,Is he?
167,Monica,"Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend."
168,Chandler,Why?!
169,Chandler,"I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this."
170,Ross,"All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben."
171,Ross,"Yeah, would you please consider moving here?"
172,Ross,"I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?"
173,Ross,"Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here."
174,Ross,You have to come here so we can work this out.
175,Ross,"All right, did you just say all right?"
176,Ross,"Oh, Emily that is, that is so great."
177,Ross,It's gonna be so great!
178,Ross,We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!
179,Ross,"Yes, tell me."
180,Ross,I know.
181,Ross,"I am, I am so sorry."
182,Ross,"Again, very sorry."
183,Ross,"Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me."
184,Ross,Okay?
185,Ross,I love you.
186,Ross,Oh that is so great!
187,Ross,That's
188,Ross,"So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes."
189,Chandler,Yes!
190,Phoebe,Ooh-ohh!
191,Monica,Great!
192,Ross,No-no-no!
193,Ross,Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
194,Phoebe,Why?
195,Monica,What?!
196,Monica,You can'twhat did you tell her?
197,Ross,I told her I'd have to think about it.
198,Ross,"I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision?"
199,Ross,I'm actually asking you!
200,Chandler,"Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends."
201,Monica,Yeah!
202,Monica,"But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife."
203,Phoebe,Yeah.
204,Chandler,That's true!
205,Phoebe,"Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life."
206,Chandler,That's true!
207,Monica,"No, you cannot."
208,Ross,"Thanks for the help, problem solved."
209,Monica,Hello.
210,Joey,Hey Mon!
211,Monica,Oh hey Joey!
212,Monica,"We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?"
213,Joey,"See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure."
214,Monica,You're not on TV.
215,Joey,"Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?"
216,Chandler,"Hey, there he is!"
217,Chandler,There he is!
218,Joey,Hello New York!
219,Chandler,"How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!"
220,Monica,Hi Chandler.
221,Chandler,Hey!
222,Monica,"Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day."
223,Chandler,Oh that was yours?
224,Chandler,"Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars."
225,Monica,"William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27."
226,Chandler,Expect it in 4-6 weeks.
227,Chandler,"Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves."
228,Monica,"Yeah, so?"
229,Chandler,"Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had."
230,Monica,"Y'know what, champ?"
231,Monica,I think I'll pass.
232,Chandler,Why?
233,Monica,Why?
234,Chandler,What's your point?
235,Joey,PBS telethon.
236,Phoebe,"Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed."
237,Phoebe,I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
238,Joey,What?!
239,Joey,What good is that gonna do anybody?
240,Phoebe,"Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends."
241,Phoebe,The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
242,Joey,"Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya."
243,Phoebe,"Aw, dammit!"
244,Phoebe,Stage
245,Joey,"Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?"
246,Joey,PBS
247,Joey,Come on man!
248,Joey,You've been here all day!
249,Joey,PBS
250,Ross,"Okay, that's it."
251,Ross,I cannot make this decision!
252,Ross,"It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate."
253,Monica,A Magic Eight ball?!
254,Monica,"You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!"
255,Phoebe,"Ooh, it's not a toy."
256,Ross,"Well, I don't know what else to do."
257,Ross,"I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30!"
258,Ross,"So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it!"
259,Ross,'Cause I-I got nothing!
260,Ross,"All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do."
261,Ross,Okay then.
262,Ross,Here we go.
263,Ross,"Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again?"
264,Ross,Ask again later.
265,Ross,Later is not good enough.
266,Ross,Ask again later.
267,Ross,What the hell!
268,Ross,This is broken!
269,Ross,It-it is broken!
270,Monica,"All right, let me see."
271,Monica,Will Chandler have sex tonight?
272,Monica,Don't count on it.
273,Monica,Seems like it works to me.
274,Joey,PBS Telethon.
275,Phoebe,Hi Joey.
276,Joey,Hey Pheebs!
277,Phoebe,I would like to make a pledge.
278,Phoebe,I would like to donate $200.
279,Joey,$200?
280,Joey,Are you sure Pheebs?
281,Joey,"I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?"
282,Phoebe,"Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it."
283,Phoebe,"So there, a selfless good deed."
284,Joey,And you don't a little good about donating the money?
285,Phoebe,"No, it sucks."
286,Phoebe,I was saving up to buy a hamster.
287,Joey,A hamster?
288,Joey,"What, those things are like 10 bucks."
289,Phoebe,"Yeah, not the one I had my eye on."
290,Phoebe,Gary
291,Phoebe,"Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV!"
292,Phoebe,Isn't that great?
293,Phoebe,My pledge got Joey on TV!
294,Phoebe,Oh that makes me feelOh no!
295,Chandler,"Look, maybe I got carried away before."
296,Chandler,But there's something you gotta know.
297,Chandler,"If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best."
298,Monica,Keep talking.
299,Chandler,I mean I was nothing before you.
300,Chandler,Call the other girls and ask.
301,Chandler,Which wouldn't take long.
302,Chandler,"But when I'm with you, and we're together, OHMYGOD."
303,Monica,Really?
304,Chandler,Oh-aw my God!
305,Chandler,"Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong."
306,Chandler,We're too good!
307,Chandler,"We owe it, to sex!"
308,Monica,"Well, if we owe it?"
309,Monica,Oh my When is Joey gonna be home?
310,Chandler,"Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him."
311,Chandler,"Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on."
312,Monica,"But, I just cleaned the bathroom."
313,Chandler,"Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves."
314,Monica,Yeah.
315,Chandler,"All right, let's show them how it's done."
316,Monica,Okay.
317,Monica,Ow!
318,Chandler,Y'know that wasn't part of it?
319,Monica,I know!
320,Rachel,Hi!
321,Rachel,Are you ready?
322,Rachel,We're gonna be late!
323,Ross,For what?
324,Rachel,For Stella!
325,Rachel,Remember?
326,Rachel,She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
327,Ross,"Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that."
328,Ross,You mind if I take a rain check?
329,Ross,I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
330,Rachel,Sure.
331,Rachel,I guess.
332,Rachel,"Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London."
333,Rachel,Yay!
334,Ross,"It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff."
335,Rachel,Like what?
336,Ross,Just stuff.
337,Ross,Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
338,Rachel,"Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help."
339,Ross,No.
340,Ross,No.
341,Ross,You-you can't help.
342,Ross,"I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help."
343,Rachel,"Well, I-I know you can do that too."
344,Rachel,"I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to Hi!"
345,Ross,Thanks.
346,Rachel,Ross?
347,Rachel,"Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her."
348,Rachel,"Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her."
349,Rachel,So just fix whatever she wants fixed.
350,Rachel,Just do it.
351,Rachel,"I mean, you're gonna have to try."
352,Rachel,You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't.
353,Rachel,Oh come on answer it!
354,Rachel,It's driving me crazy!
355,Ross,Hello.
356,Ross,Hi sweetie.
357,Ross,Good.
358,Ross,"Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it."

1,Rachel,Hey.
2,Joey,What are you doing?
3,Rachel,"Well, y'know I was thinking of moving the couch over here."
4,Joey,Why would you want to do that?
5,Rachel,So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
6,Joey,"Rach, there is a decent place to"
7,Rachel,And your lap does not count!
8,Rachel,Okay?
9,Rachel,Come on help me move this.
10,Joey,No.
11,Joey,No.

14,Joey,No.
15,Joey,Rosita does not move.
16,Rachel,"I'm sorry, Rosita?"
17,Rachel,As in
18,Joey,As in Rosita does not move.
19,Rachel,"Joey, it's just a chair!"
20,Rachel,What's the big deal?
21,Joey,The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any glare coming of off Stevie.
22,Rachel,Stevie the TV?
23,Joey,Is there a problem?
24,Rachel,No!
25,Rachel,Oh what does he know!
26,Rachel,"Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together!"
27,Rachel,You bitch!
28,Rachel,Opening Credits
29,Ross,"Hey, y'know what's weird?"
30,Ross,"After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you're gonna have to say, ""This is my brother-in-law Ross."""
31,Ross,"Not, ""My friend Ross,"" ""brother-in-law Ross."""
32,Ross,That's weird isn't it?
33,Chandler,"Couldn't I just say, ""This is Ross?"""
34,Ross,"Sure, do whatever you want."
35,Monica,Hey Ross!
36,Monica,"So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section"
37,Ross,Yeah?
38,Monica,Look at this.
39,Ross,"Oh, it looks like mom and dad's house."
40,Ross,"Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic isOh my God!"
41,Phoebe,What?
42,Phoebe,What happened to the window in the attic?
43,Monica,I can't believe mom and dad are selling the house!
44,Ross,I can't believe they-they didn't even tell us!
45,Phoebe,I can't believe I still don't know what happened to the window in the attic!
46,Ross,"Uh, hello dad!"
47,Ross,Monica and I just saw the house in the paper!
48,Ross,Yes we're surprised!
49,Ross,Who did you leave a message with?
50,Chandler,Sorry!
51,Rachel,"Joey, Joey I am so sorry."
52,Joey,I told you not to move it!
53,Joey,"Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don't, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?"
54,Rachel,"Okay, come onJoey, I'll buy you a new one!"
55,Rachel,All right?
56,Rachel,We'll go down to the store right now and we'll-we'll get you a new chair.
57,Joey,She's not even cold yet!
58,Rachel,But don't you think Rosita would've wanted you to move on?
59,Rachel,"I mean y'know, she did always putyour comfort first."
60,Joey,That's true.
61,Rachel,Okay?
62,Rachel,You ready?
63,Joey,"Yeah, I  I don't want Stevie to see her like this."
64,Ross,I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in.
65,Ross,"Man, some-some stranger's gonna be living in my room."
66,Monica,"Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down."
67,Ross,They kept your room for a while.
68,Monica,Oh please!
69,Monica,Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out!
70,Monica,"I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogues, not a gym!"
71,Ross,"Come on, you know they love you."
72,Monica,As much as they love you?
73,Ross,I was their first born!
74,Ross,They thought she was barren!
75,Ross,It's not my fault.
76,Phoebe,Hey.
77,Ross,Hey.
78,Monica,Hey!
79,Phoebe,"Ugh, I hate this year!"
80,Ross,What's wrong with this year?
81,Phoebe,"Well okay, it's already February and I've only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!"
82,Monica,That was me and Ross.
83,Phoebe,Oh that's right!
84,Ross,"Hey, y'know if you want to pick up some extra cash?"
85,Ross,Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
86,Monica,Oh that's a great idea.
87,Monica,You're really good on the phone.
88,Phoebe,"Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had."
89,Phoebe,"Y'know, I probably wouldn't have to say spank as much."
90,Ross,What?
91,Phoebe,"Oh yeah, like you never called!"
92,Phoebe,"Okay, I can do that!"
93,Phoebe,"Oh, by the way, I love my office."
94,Phoebe,Oh okay.
95,Phoebe,"Umm, all right."
96,Phoebe,"Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?"
97,Phoebe,"Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs."
98,Phoebe,"Oh okay, well I'm sorry to bother you."
99,Phoebe,Bye-bye.
100,Phoebe,"Yeah you're right, this is easy."
101,Phoebe,"Oh well, all rightum, no offense, but you were kind of rude."
102,Phoebe,Oh.
103,Phoebe,No.
104,Phoebe,Oh wait yes!
105,Phoebe,"I do, I do have one question."
106,Phoebe,What is toner?
107,Chandler,Joey!
108,Chandler,Joe!
109,Chandler,Full bag.
110,Chandler,Beer's still cold.
111,Chandler,Something terrible must've happened here!
112,Chandler,Oh no-no-no-no-no-no!
113,Chandler,"Stevie, I was never here!"
114,Ross,Dad?
115,Ross,Mr.
116,Ross,Hey!
117,Ross,Mr.
118,Ross,"Dad, we-we can't believe you're selling the house."
119,Ross,Mr.
120,Ross,Let's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
121,Ross,Mr.
122,Monica,"Oh, that's okay, I can't wait to see everything again!"
123,Monica,All of the memories Mr.
124,Monica,I used to love to play restaurant.
125,Ross,"Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater."
126,Monica,"Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!"
127,Monica,Mr.
128,Ross,Wow!
129,Ross,Great!
130,Ross,"Wait, dad who-who's cigarettes are these?"
131,Ross,Mr.
132,Ross,Cool!
133,Ross,Dad!
134,Ross,My report cards!
135,Ross,"Hey, check this out dad,  Math, A."
136,Ross,"Science, A."
137,Ross,"History, A."
138,Ross,"Gym Oooh, my rock polisher!"
139,Ross,Mr.
140,Ross,It's a clown kit!
141,Ross,Clown kit!
142,Ross,Mr.
143,Ross,What?
144,Ross,Mr.
145,Ross,How are you ever going to sell this place?
146,Ross,Mr.
147,Ross,Oh no.
148,Ross,Dad!
149,Ross,Dad!
150,Ross,What Oh Godeverything's ruined!
151,Ross,"Dad, she's gonna be crushed!"
152,Ross,Mr.
153,Ross,No!
154,Ross,Mr.
155,Phoebe,"Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?"
156,Phoebe,"Earl, thanks."
157,Phoebe,"Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs."
158,Phoebe,"I'm hearing what you're saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner."
159,Phoebe,May I ask why?
160,Phoebe,I surely do!
161,Phoebe,"Umm, is-is that because you're out of toner?"
162,Phoebe,Commercial Break
163,Phoebe,No-no wait-wait!
164,Phoebe,I can't just let you hang up!
165,Phoebe,Just please talk to me.
166,Phoebe,Yeah!
167,Phoebe,"Now, why do you want to kill yourself?"
168,Phoebe,Chandler?
169,Phoebe,"No look, I-I'm sure that people know you exist!"
170,Chandler,My chair.
171,Chandler,"Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!"
172,Rachel,You will like it!
173,Joey,No I won't.
174,Rachel,You don't even know!
175,Joey,"Because, I know what I like and what I don't like!"
176,Joey,It's not the same thing!
177,Rachel,"Well look, if you don't like this"
178,Joey,I don't know why you say that so soon.
179,Rachel,"Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair!"
180,Rachel,The most expensive one in the store!
181,Rachel,"Hey, y'know what I was thinking?"
182,Rachel,We could name her Francette.
183,Joey,Francette?
184,Joey,What is she?
185,Joey,A couch?
186,Joey,Poor thing.
187,Joey,Cut down in her prime.
188,Rachel,"Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour."
189,Rachel,Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here.
190,Rachel,"Y'know, start the heeling process?"
191,Joey,"Well, I guess you're right."
192,Joey,"Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator."
193,Joey,"It's gonna be so said, and kinda cool."
194,Joey,She's heeled!
195,Rachel,That's weird.
196,Joey,"No it's not weird, it's a miracle!"
197,Rachel,It's not a miracle Joey!
198,Rachel,I'm sure there's some explanation.
199,Joey,Oh there is!
200,Joey,"If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!"
201,Rachel,"Joey, I really don't"
202,Joey,Can you tell me how this happened?
203,Rachel,Well no.
204,Joey,Miracle!
205,Rachel,"No, y'know what?"
206,Rachel,Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it!
207,Rachel,Or something!
208,Joey,Someone like anangel?
209,Rachel,"That's right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair."
210,Joey,Get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
211,Ross,Dad that won't matter to her.
212,Ross,"Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff!"
213,Ross,"See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her."
214,Ross,Mr.
215,Ross,"Well, can you blame her?"
216,Ross,Mr.
217,Ross,"Dad, dad I don't want to hear about it."
218,Ross,Mr.
219,Ross,"Well, not right now."
220,Ross,"Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we're gonna give her some!"
221,Ross,"Okay, grabgrab some empty boxes."

231,Ross,She-she could've won this!
232,Ross,Mr.
233,Ross,Sure!
234,Ross,"Ooh-ooh, what about this?"
235,Ross,Mr.
236,Rachel,I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!
237,Joey,"Yeah, me too."
238,Rachel,"Hey, how'show's the uh, miracle chair?"
239,Joey,Fine.
240,Rachel,Yeah?
241,Rachel,Wow!
242,Rachel,"Y'know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!"
243,Joey,No.
244,Joey,Really?
245,Rachel,Yeah!
246,Rachel,You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
247,Joey,My chair heels itself.
248,Phoebe,"Earl, you're not hearing me!"
249,Phoebe,All I'm saying is that you're not alone all right?
250,Phoebe,Everybody hates the people they work with!
251,Phoebe,"Wait, what was that?"
252,Phoebe,That sounded like someone being nice to you.
253,Phoebe,"All right so Earl, let's just forget about the people at the office, okay?"
254,Phoebe,There-there's gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for!
255,Phoebe,"What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?"
256,Phoebe,"Oh sorry, boyfriend!"
257,Phoebe,"No, whatever!"
258,Phoebe,Anything!
259,Phoebe,"The ""Hey Guy"""

307,Monica,And if you say the words medical marvel I'm going to Easy Bake your head!
308,Monica,Mr.
309,Monica,"So wait, Ross's stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!"
310,Monica,Mr.
311,Monica,I can't believe this!
312,Monica,Mr.
313,Rachel,Hey Chandler!
314,Chandler,Hey!
315,Rachel,"How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?"
316,Chandler,"Yeah, I'd love to but I've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore."
317,Rachel,"Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?"
318,Chandler,Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete?
319,Chandler,The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
320,Rachel,I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.
321,Chandler,That's awesome!
322,Chandler,That's great!
323,Chandler,What made you do it?
324,Rachel,"Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair"
325,Chandler,Whoa-whoa-whoa!
326,Chandler,You broke Joey's chair?
327,Rachel,Yeah.
328,Chandler,I thought I broke Joey's chair!
329,Chandler,That's why I replaced it with mine!
330,Rachel,Ohhhhh.
331,Rachel,That's how it got fixed!
332,Chandler,"Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?"
333,Rachel,Noo!
334,Rachel,Angels.
335,Chandler,I'm gettin' my chair back!
336,Rachel,What?
337,Rachel,Wh-hey!
338,Joey,"Well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all!"
339,Joey,Yeah!
340,Joey,"So, I guess this chair is mine now!"
341,Chandler,Joey you broke my chair!
342,Joey,Your chair?
343,Rachel,"Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!"
344,Joey,"So, there was no miracle?"
345,Rachel,"No Joe, no miracle."
346,Joey,Oh no this is devastating!
347,Joey,My faith is shaken.
348,Joey,I'm so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
349,Rachel,Uh-huh!
350,Rachel,"Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore!"
351,Rachel,All right?
352,Rachel,That is my chair now!
353,Rachel,You can sit on my lap!
354,Rachel,No I take that back!
355,Chandler,I think I should get the chair!
356,Joey,How do you figure?
357,Chandler,Because you  broke a chair and you  broke a chair!
358,Chandler,"The only one around here that hasn't broke a chair, is me!"
359,Rachel,No-no-no!
360,Rachel,This chair's not going anywhere.
361,Chandler,"Well, where's the logic in that?"
362,Rachel,"The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!"
363,Chandler,So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
364,Joey,That's right!
365,Chandler,What are you guys?
366,Chandler,Like a gang or something?
367,Joey,Yeah!
368,Joey,We are!
369,Rachel,We're the Cobras!
370,Phoebe,Excuse me!
371,Phoebe,Can you tell me where I can find Earl?
372,Phoebe,He's the supply manager around here.
373,Phoebe,Earl!
374,Phoebe,I'm Phoebe.
375,Phoebe,"Umm, look it, you-you can't kill yourself."
376,Phoebe,No-no I can't!
377,Phoebe,I can't let you do it!
378,Phoebe,Because it was fate that made me call you today!
379,Phoebe,No!
380,Phoebe,Think about it okay?
381,Phoebe,This isn't even my regular job!
382,Phoebe,Okay?
383,Phoebe,"And my first day on the job, you're my first call!"
384,Phoebe,"And-and somebody else might've hung up on you, but I wouldn't do that because I know about this stuff."
385,Phoebe,My mom killed herself.
386,Phoebe,Yes.
387,Phoebe,I'm not gonna give you tips!
388,Phoebe,Look don't you see that this-thisthis all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
389,Phoebe,"No, it's fate!"
390,Phoebe,Oh.
391,Phoebe,"Well umm, okay here's a weird thing."
392,Phoebe,My mother was also a supply manager.
393,Phoebe,Oh my God!
394,Phoebe,So was she!
395,Phoebe,And!
396,Phoebe,"Get this, okay?"
397,Phoebe,"Your-your name is Earl, right?"

403,Phoebe,"Oh, I've got-I've got goose bumps."
404,Phoebe,"Well, y'know I'm wearing layers and it's warm."
405,Phoebe,"But ifno look, okay."
406,Phoebe,"These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does!"
407,Phoebe,And that says a lot!
408,Phoebe,"Y'know, I don't-I don't think it's you."
409,Phoebe,This is a freaky place.

416,Monica,"It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is!"
417,Monica,"Ohh, it's still soft."
418,Monica,What do you think this is?
419,Ross,All right.

68,Joey,I've taken care of hundreds of kids.
69,Joey,"Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?"
70,Chandler,"I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window."
71,Ross,"Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag."

81,Rachel,Ok.
82,Phoebe,I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song.
83,Phoebe,Stop me if you've heard it.
84,Phoebe,"My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget."
85,Rachel,What's up?
86,Rachel,But what about Phoebe?
87,Rachel,"Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her."
88,Rachel,"Oh, no no no no."
89,Rachel,Oh no no no no.
90,Rachel,I have to do this to her?
91,Phoebe,"Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed."
92,Chandler,"You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff."
93,Chandler,Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
94,Joey,It's gonna be worth it.
95,Joey,"It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ?"
96,Joey,Women love guys who love babies.
97,Joey,It's that whole sensitive thing.

119,Phoebe,"Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top."
120,Rachel,"Terry is a jerk, ok?"
121,Rachel,"That's why we're always saying ""Terry's a jerk!"""
122,Rachel,That's where that came from.
123,Phoebe,"Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could."
124,Rachel,"Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do."
125,Rachel,"All right, look, look."

142,Rachel,What?
143,Phoebe,Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.
144,Rachel,"Oh, no, no no."
145,Rachel,I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a professional.
146,Phoebe,"Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid."
147,Rachel,"Well, but Pheebs."
148,Phoebe,"No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no."
149,Phoebe,"No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band."
150,Phoebe,"You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play."
151,Phoebe,"When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity."
152,Phoebe,Thank you!
153,Phoebe,La la la la la la la....
154,Ross,"Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot."
155,Ross,"Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun."
156,Monica,"Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please?"
157,Monica,My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
158,Ross,Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
159,Monica,"My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally."
160,Ross,Tho?
161,Ross,Ohhh.
162,Monica,"That's good, have a seat."
163,Monica,"Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle."
164,Monica,"You're just gonna have to be brave, ok?"
165,Monica,Can you do that for me?
166,Ross,Ok.
167,Monica,Ok. Oh boy.
168,Monica,You are doin' so good.
169,Monica,You wanna squeeze my hand?

171,Monica,"Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard!"
172,Monica,"Oh, Ross!"
173,Monica,Let go of my hand!
174,Chandler,"That's a good plan, Joe."
175,Chandler,"Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out."
176,Chandler,"Taxi, taxi!"
177,Joey,"Hey, hey, look at that talent."

285,Phoebe,Thank you.
286,Rachel,"Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well."
287,Phoebe,Eight dollars and 27 cents.
288,Phoebe,"But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better."
289,Rachel,Do you?
290,Phoebe,No.
291,Phoebe,This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me.
292,Phoebe,"You know, I don't know, when I sang ""Su-Su-Suicide"", I got a dollar seventy-five."
293,Phoebe,"But then, ""Smelly Cat"", I got 25 cents and a condom."
294,Phoebe,"So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat."
295,Rachel,"Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat."
296,Rachel,"You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!"
297,Phoebe,It's not even that.
298,Phoebe,"I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money."
299,Rachel,"Well, people missed you in there."
300,Rachel,"And in fact, there was actually a request for ""Smelly Cat""."
301,Phoebe,Really?
302,Phoebe,From who?
303,Rachel,"Well, from me."
304,Rachel,"And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite."
305,Phoebe,Yeah.
306,Phoebe,Here you go.
307,Ross,I just wanna thank you for being there for me today.
308,Ross,"And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand."
309,Monica,That's ok.
310,Monica,I'm sorry I poisoned you.
311,Ross,Yeah.
312,Ross,"Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?"
313,Monica,Remember it?
314,Monica,"What do you think this is, a freckle?"
315,Ross,Oh.
316,Monica,"Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?"
317,Ross,"Oh, man."
318,Ross,"Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?"
319,Monica,No.
320,Monica,But I remember people telling me about it.
321,Ross,I hope Ben has a little sister.
322,Monica,Yeah.
323,Monica,I hope she can kick his ass.
324,Ross,I'm gonna get a new band-aid.
325,Ross,"Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?"
326,Monica,That was you?
327,Ross,"They, uh, were infected."
328,Ross,He wouldn't have made it.
329,Monica,"Aw, my little nephew."
330,Monica,"Come here, little one."

341,Joey,"Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today."
342,Ross,Ohhh.
343,Ross,"Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question."

345,Chandler,"You, you are gonna love this."
346,Ross,Will you hold Ben for a sec?
347,Ross,Come here.
348,Ross,Come here.
349,Chandler,"Stay back, I've got kiwi."
350,Chandler,"Run, Joey, Run!"
351,Phoebe,"No, no, no."
352,Phoebe,I'm sorry.
353,Phoebe,"It's ""smelly cat, smel-ly cat""."
354,Phoebe,Better.
355,Phoebe,Yeah.
356,Phoebe,"Yeah, much better."
357,Phoebe,"And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song."
358,Phoebe,You wanna try it again?
359,Phoebe,"Ok, there is no top."
360,Phoebe,That's the beauty of Smelly Cat.
361,Phoebe,"Um, why don't you just follow me?"
362,Phoebe,Mmmm hmmm.

4,Phoebe,"Oo, I never thought of that before."
5,Chandler,I like her.
6,Phoebe,Why?
7,Phoebe,Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
8,Chandler,"Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people."
9,Monica,Look at you.
10,Monica,All jealous.
11,Ross,"Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles."
12,Ross,"Y'know, she's more.. y'know, and you're more"
13,Phoebe,"Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she's done."
14,Phoebe,"Oh no, one of those look for the hidden meaning' songs."
15,Phoebe,Opening Credits
16,Phoebe,"Hey Leslie, how'd you know I'd be here?"
17,Chandler,"All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again."
18,Chandler,I'd like know whether that's several big fish or just one big fish.
19,Joey,"So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles."
20,Phoebe,Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
21,Joey,"Ah, anything we might of heard of?"
22,Joey,Home is Home Star stew.
23,Phoebe,"Hmm, bummer."
24,Phoebe,No.
25,Phoebe,But thanks.
26,Phoebe,Okay.
27,Phoebe,No.
28,Phoebe,But thanks.
29,Joey,"Wow, that was kinda brutal."
30,Phoebe,"Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right."
31,Phoebe,"Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y'know."
32,Phoebe,"Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior."
33,Phoebe,"Can I have a tissue, please?"
34,Monica,"Yeah, sure."
35,Chandler,No.
36,Chandler,This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called wait until the last moment before I burst and die.'
37,Chandler,"Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi!"
38,Chandler,"So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?"
39,Chandler,"Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I'm-I'm talking to ah, ."

52,Ross,"Yeah, huh."
53,Rachel,I've got some bad news.
54,Ross,What?
55,Rachel,"I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here."
56,Ross,Come on sweetie!
57,Ross,"You've had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?"
58,Ross,But work comes first!
59,Ross,"Oh hey, but that's sad about you though, what happened?"
60,Ross,Burn out?
61,Ross,"Burn all out, did ya?"
62,Rachel,"Nooo, he's leaving for a better job."
63,Ross,"Oh well that's great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then."
64,Ross,Huh?
65,Ross,Good bye.

67,Rachel,Well we're gonna miss you around here.
68,Rachel,"Yeah, you bet."
69,Phoebe,Oh.
70,Monica,Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
71,Phoebe,"Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together."
72,Phoebe,That's the twentieth time today!
73,Phoebe,And good luck Leslie!
74,Monica,"Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?"
75,Phoebe,"Well, yeah."
76,Phoebe,"Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together."
77,Monica,"Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge."
78,Phoebe,You never run on a barge!
79,Joey,Hey.
80,Joey,Phoebe and
81,Monica,Hey.
82,Joey,"Is ah, is Chandler around?"
83,Monica,"No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house."
84,Joey,Oooh.
85,Monica,"Yeah, Ginger something."
86,Joey,Nooo.
87,Joey,"No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?"
88,Monica,"No, it was Ginger."
89,Monica,"I remember, because when he told me, I said,  the movie star.'"
90,Joey,"Aww, man."
91,Joey,That's the girl I was hiding from.
92,Joey,"When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did."
93,Monica,"Well, what did you do?"
94,Joey,"What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life."
95,Monica,"Y'know what, don't tell us."
96,Monica,"We'll just wait until Chandler gets home,  because it'll be more fun that way."
97,Joey,All right!!
98,Joey,"Okay, it was like four years ago."
99,Joey,"Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin."
100,Joey,"Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper."
101,Joey,"Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner...."
102,Monica,You gave her food poisoning!
103,Joey,I wish.
104,Joey,No.
105,Joey,"After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire."
106,Joey,Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out.
107,Joey,"So, I picked up a log and threw it on."
108,Joey,"Or, at least what I thought was a log."
109,Phoebe,Oh my God!!
110,Phoebe,You threw Pepper on the fire!
111,Joey,I wish.
112,Joey,"See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg."
113,Monica,Oh my God!
114,Monica,"Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?"
115,Joey,I ran!
116,Chandler,"Well, that's the best kiss I've had with anyone I've ever met in a men's room."
117,Chandler,"Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle."
118,Chandler,"Yeah, we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes."
119,Chandler,"No, really you're gonna freeze."
120,Chandler,"You're not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?"
121,Rachel,Funny book?
122,Ross,Hmmm.
123,Ross,"Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today."
124,Ross,"Umm, Mark, Mark saying I'll see you Saturday.'"
125,Rachel,"Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind."
126,Ross,"Oh, no, no, no, it's-it's not the lecture ah, I mind, umm...."
127,Rachel,"Oh, please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark."
128,Ross,"Oh, well..."
129,Rachel,Oh my God!!!
130,Rachel,Ross!
131,Ross,"Well, I'm sorry, but ah, look if you're not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?"
132,Rachel,"Because, he's my friend."
133,Ross,"Okay, but do you really need another friend?"
134,Ross,I mean...
135,Rachel,"Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?"
136,Ross,Is that funny?
137,Ross,Am I supposed to be laughing?
138,Rachel,"I don't know, you thought See you Saturday' was funny."
139,Rachel,"Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with."
140,Rachel,You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
141,Ross,Pa-haa!!
142,Ross,I would love to go with you.
143,Rachel,Really!
144,Ross,"Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out."
145,Ross,"I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger."
146,Rachel,Okay.
147,Rachel,"Honey, I would love for you to go with me."
148,Rachel,What?
149,Ross,"What should I wear, now I'm all nervous."
150,Monica,Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
151,Phoebe,"It's just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn't called."
152,Phoebe,"Not that I even care, y'know."
153,Monica,Phoebe why don't you just call her?
154,Monica,You obviously want to.
155,Phoebe,You think you know me so well.
156,Monica,"Well, don't cha wanna?"
157,Phoebe,Yeah.
158,Monica,"Okay, well I do know you."
159,Phoebe,That's what I said.
160,Monica,Well so?
161,Phoebe,I can't.
162,Phoebe,I can't.
163,Phoebe,"She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was Okay, bye Pheebs' gone."
164,Phoebe,"Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I've ever had in like all my lives."
165,Phoebe,I stepped in something icky.
166,Phoebe,Phoebe and
167,Ross,I'm really glad we came.
168,Ross,You're so pretty.
169,Ross,I love you.
170,Rachel,Oh.
171,Phoebe,"Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?"
172,Phoebe,"Smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault."
173,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah!"
174,Phoebe,"I..., a jingle?"
175,Phoebe,"No, no-no-no, no."
176,Phoebe,"Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now, y'know."
177,Phoebe,You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
178,Phoebe,That's okay.
179,Phoebe,"All right, I'm gonna play song that's really, really sad."
180,Phoebe,It's called Magician Box Mix Up.
181,Monica,Hi!
182,Chandler,Hey.
183,Monica,"Oh, can I borrow this?"
184,Monica,My milk's gone bad.
185,Chandler,"Oh, I hate that."
186,Chandler,"I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car."
187,Monica,"So umm, how was your date with Ginger?"
188,Chandler,Great.
189,Chandler,It was great.
190,Chandler,"She's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness."
191,Monica,"Sounds like she's got the ah, whole package."
192,Chandler,"Joey told you about the leg, huh?"
193,Monica,Uh-huh.
194,Chandler,"Oh God, it freaked me out."
195,Chandler,"Okay, I know it shouldn't have, but it did."
196,Chandler,"I mean I like her, I don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like Hey, y'know what, where's your leg?'"
197,Chandler,I mean I'm the smallest person in the world aren't I?
198,Chandler,I'm the smallest person in the world.
199,Joey,Morning.
200,Chandler,Actually he's the smallest person in the world.
201,Joey,Heard about the leg burnin' huh?
202,Chandler,It came up.
203,Joey,"Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot."
204,Joey,"But, by any chance did she find that funny?"
205,Ross,So I nodded off a little.
206,Rachel,Nodded off!!
207,Rachel,Ross you were snoring.
208,Rachel,My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
209,Ross,Come on!
210,Ross,Forty-five minutes!
211,Ross,Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
212,Rachel,"Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's Hey everybody!"
213,Rachel,Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years.
214,Rachel,Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!'
215,Ross,First of all it's Professor Pittain!
216,Ross,"And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly."
217,Rachel,"Okay, see now, what I just"
218,Ross,"Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka."
219,Rachel,"Oh, that is so..."
220,Ross,"No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island."
221,Rachel,"Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning?"
222,Rachel,Huh?
223,Rachel,Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?
224,Ross,No.
225,Ross,I...
226,Ross,I wanted to be with you.
227,Ross,"I don't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know."
228,Ross,"With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on."
229,Ross,"I-I-I know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it."
230,Rachel,It's not dumb.
231,Rachel,"But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it."
232,Rachel,Y'know what I mean?
233,Rachel,"I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life."
234,Ross,That's a little clearer.
235,Rachel,"Honey see, it doesn't mean that I don't love you."
236,Rachel,Because I do.
237,Rachel,"I love you, I love you so much."
238,Rachel,"But my work it's-it's for me y'know, I'm out there, on my own, and I'm doing it and it's scary but I love it, because it's mine."
239,Rachel,"I, but, I mean is that okay?"
240,Ross,"Sure, I-I-I..."
241,Chandler,No.
242,Chandler,No.
243,Chandler,"Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?"
244,Chandler,No.
245,Chandler,No.
246,Chandler,I don't think so.
247,Chandler,That's-that's my nubbin.
248,Chandler,"It's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing."
249,Chandler,"Well, y'know two regulars."
250,Chandler,"And ah one that barely qualifies as...  Ahh, what?"
251,Chandler,"You ah, you have, you have to leave, now?"
252,Chandler,How come?
253,Phoebe,"Oh, I thought you weren't coming."
254,Phoebe,What?
255,Phoebe,Where were you?
256,Phoebe,"Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad, okay"
257,Phoebe,"No, look, I told you that I didn't want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway."
258,Phoebe,"God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would've done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself."
259,Phoebe,And if I can't trust you then just forget it.
260,Phoebe,Okay y'know what you have to choose.
261,Phoebe,"All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won't be partners."

161,Chandler,"Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one."
162,Chandler,"Now, this one's free, right?"
163,Chandler,"Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free."
164,Ross,"Laugh it up, but the joke's on you."
165,Ross,"Because we don't need to get divorced, okay?"
166,Ross,We we're just gonna get an annulment.
167,Joey,An annulment?
168,Joey,Ross!
169,Joey,I don't think surgery's the answer here.

172,Phoebe,You're thing.
173,Phoebe,You're thing.
174,Phoebe,Y'know?

178,Phoebe,Yes you do!
179,Phoebe,This is your third divorce!
180,Phoebe,You love divorce so much you're probably gonna marry it!

183,Monica,"So, what do you think we should do?"
184,Chandler,I don't know.
185,Chandler,But I-I-I know I love you!
186,Monica,I know I love you!
187,Chandler,So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing?
188,Chandler,I love you.
189,Monica,That's a good question.
190,Monica,"Look umm, last night we let the dice decide."
191,Monica,Maybe we should leave it up to fate again.
192,Monica,I love you!
193,Chandler,"Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign!"
194,Chandler,"Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight  then there's a definite sign that we should get married."
195,Monica,"All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married."
196,Chandler,Sounds great.

200,Monica,Come on eight.
201,Chandler,"Yes, yes eight."
202,Monica,Wow!
203,Monica,I can't believe I actually rolled an eight.
204,Chandler,That was so unlikely.
205,Chandler,"Well, let's get married!"
206,Chandler,I guess.
207,Monica,Wait a minute.
208,Monica,That wasn't a hard eight!
209,Monica,Last night I rolled a hard eight.
210,Chandler,That's right!
211,Chandler,"It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding!"
212,Chandler,Damnit!
213,Monica,I wanted it so bad!
214,Monica,Wanna go pack?
215,Chandler,Yeah.
216,Chandler,"We're doing the right thing, right?"
217,Monica,"Ohh, of course we are!"
218,Monica,We left it up to fate.
219,Monica,If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.
220,Phoebe,"Okay, you have 19 questions left."
221,Phoebe,Use them wisely.
222,Phoebe,Come on Joey!
223,Phoebe,You can't win if you don't ask any  QUESTIONS!!

227,Phoebe,We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back!
228,Phoebe,"That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!"
229,Joey,All right.
230,Joey,All right.

236,Joey,I wanna rock and roll all night!
237,Joey,"Man, this is a long drive!"

240,Ross,Hey!
241,Rachel,"Hey, hubby!"
242,Ross,Yeah.
243,Ross,"Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?"
244,Rachel,Uh-huh.
245,Ross,I'm not going to do that.
246,Ross,Commercial Break
247,Rachel,Okay!
248,Rachel,"So, we'll just stay married."
249,Ross,"Yes, exactly!"
250,Rachel,And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
251,Ross,Wow!
252,Ross,This is so amazing.
253,Ross,"I uh, I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more."
254,Rachel,"Okay, see now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding."
255,Ross,I'm-I'm not kidding.
256,Ross,"Look I-I, I can't have three failed marriages."
257,Ross,I can't.
258,Ross,Okay?
259,Ross,I-I am not gonna be that guy!
260,Rachel,What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?
261,Ross,"Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you?"
262,Ross,Really?
263,Ross,I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.!
264,Ross,It's right next to it!
265,Rachel,"Ohh, okay, I'm sorry."
266,Rachel,You're right.
267,Rachel,Y'know what?
268,Rachel,"We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other."
269,Rachel,"All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you're asking of me."
270,Ross,I'm asking you to do me a favor.
271,Ross,{Note
272,Rachel,You are asking me to be your wife!
273,Ross,And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
274,Monica,That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
275,Chandler,Well you did pull his hair.
276,Monica,He took my snack!
277,Chandler,I'm not getting into this again!
278,Monica,Okay!
279,Monica,"Oh God, y'know what?"
280,Monica,It's really bad.
281,Chandler,"Well, I told you not to walk."
282,Chandler,Here.
283,Chandler,There.
284,Chandler,Okay.
285,Monica,"This doesn't mean anything, does it?"
286,Chandler,No!
287,Monica,Okay.
288,Phoebe,How could you pick up a hitchhiker?!
289,Phoebe,"He could be a rape, a rapist or a killer or something!"
290,Joey,Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?
291,Phoebe,Y'know what?
292,Phoebe,I'm not talking to you!
293,Phoebe,You go back to sleep!
294,Phoebe,"And you, are you a rapist?"
295,Phoebe,Do you like car games?

302,Phoebe,Shh!
303,Ross,Hey!
304,Rachel,Hey!
305,Ross,"Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married."
306,Ross,"We register, and you get to keep all the presents!"
307,Rachel,No!
308,Rachel,"Ross, come on!"
309,Rachel,No!
310,Rachel,"Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married."
311,Ross,I don't know if it's true.
312,Rachel,Oh b-b-but it is!
313,Ross,"Oh, okay, y'know what this is?"
314,Ross,This is a difference of opinion.
315,Ross,And when that happens in a marriage...
316,Rachel,"Oh Ross, come on!"
317,Rachel,"This is not, this is not a marriage!!"
318,Rachel,This is the world's worst hangover!
319,Rachel,"Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!"
320,Ross,All right.
321,Ross,"All right, I'll do it."
322,Rachel,Thank you.
323,Rachel,"Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?"
324,Phoebe,"Oh, okay."
325,Phoebe,"And I have your name and the fact that you're a drifter, so the ball's pretty much in your court."
326,Joey,Come on Pheebs!
327,Joey,I can't take this anymore!
328,Joey,Let-let me make it up to you.
329,Joey,Huh?

335,Phoebe,That's not fair!
336,Phoebe,Y'know I can't resist that beautiful voice!
337,Joey,"Pheebs, I am so sorry!"
338,Joey,I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver.
339,Joey,But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship!
340,Joey,"So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you."
341,Phoebe,You can still sleep at night and stuff.
342,Joey,"Well, thank you."
343,Joey,"So, can we play 20 Questions now?"
344,Joey,I've got a really good one!
345,Joey,I've been thinking about it since Kansas.
346,Phoebe,Okay.

363,Monica,"It's too fast, I'm happy the way things are!"
364,Chandler,Me too!

373,Chandler,It's not like we're mar-ah-ah!
374,Chandler,"Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?"
375,Monica,Then all your stuff would be here.
376,Chandler,"Well, what if all my stuff was here?"
377,Monica,"Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense."
378,Chandler,Okay.
379,Chandler,What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
380,Monica,Live together?

44,Rachel,Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!
45,Phoebe,"Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it!"
46,Phoebe,"See, there's something going on with them."
47,Phoebe,"Look, he's getting into the car with her!"
48,Rachel,"Oh, that doesn't mean anything."

57,Phoebe,...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.
58,Chandler,"Oh, uhm..."
59,Chandler,I have to work too.
60,Chandler,"Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day."
61,Phoebe,"Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either ""Liar, Liar"" or ""Betrayal"", or... ""An Affair To Remember""."
62,Chandler,Those are all really old!
63,Phoebe,"Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm..."
64,Rachel,"""Dude, Where's My Car?"""

73,Phoebe,I got them!
74,Chandler,Hi!
75,Monica,Hey!
76,Monica,You smell like perfume and cigarettes.
77,Chandler,I was in the car with Nancy all day.
78,Monica,Nancy doesn’t smoke!
79,Chandler,"Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!"
80,Monica,So?
81,Monica,What do you think of the house?
82,Chandler,It’s perfect.
83,Chandler,It’s everything we’ve been looking for.
84,Monica,Isn’t it?
85,Monica,Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?
86,Chandler,And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps?
87,Chandler,What were the things you said?
88,Monica,Don’t you love the huge yard?
89,Chandler,And the fireplace in the bedroom.
90,Monica,"And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!"
91,Chandler,This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
92,Monica,So?
93,Monica,Do you think we should get it?
94,Chandler,I don’t know.
95,Chandler,What do you think?
96,Monica,I think we should.
97,Chandler,I do too.
98,Monica,This is huge!
99,Chandler,I know.
100,Monica,"How bad you wanna smoke, right now."
101,Chandler,"I don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette!"
102,Chandler,"Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy’s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day."
103,Monica,Gotcha.
104,Monica,When do we tell them about this?
105,Chandler,We don’t.
106,Chandler,Not until it's a hundred percent.
107,Chandler,"I mean, why upset everybody over nothing."
108,Monica,Okay.
109,Monica,Right.
110,Monica,Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.
111,Chandler,I know.
112,Chandler,Gooooood luck with it.
113,Ross,I just can’t see Chandler cheating!
114,Rachel,"I’m telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!"
115,Joey,Chandler?
116,Joey,Forty-five minutes?
117,Joey,"Well, something is not right."
118,Joey,I just can’t believe he would do this to Monica!
119,Ross,"I know, and with the baby coming?"
120,Phoebe,"So, should we tell her?"
121,Ross,I don’t know.
122,Ross,"Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?"
123,Phoebe,Why?
124,Phoebe,Who’d you seen him with?
125,Ross,"No one, I’m just saying if..."
126,Phoebe,TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!
127,Ross,I know nothing!
128,Ross,"Mike’s a great guy, it was hypothetical!"
129,Phoebe,All right.
130,Phoebe,He is a good guy.
131,Phoebe,"You’re right, he wouldn’t cheat."
132,Ross,"Believe me, if I did see with someone, there’s no way I...  Phoebe"
133,Rachel,"Oh, look at her, so happy!"
134,Monica,If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
135,Joey,"Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?"
136,Monica,"No, he’s picking up dinner, why, what’s up?"
137,Phoebe,"Well, look, whatever happens, we’re here for you and we love you."
138,Phoebe,Monica
139,Ross,We think Chandler might be having an affair.
140,Monica,What?
141,Rachel,Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.
142,Phoebe,They went in together.
143,Phoebe,So sorry.
144,Monica,Oh my God!
145,Monica,Oh my God that’s awful!
146,Monica,What did you think of the house?
147,Phoebe,What?
148,Joey,"Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?"
149,Monica,"Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously...  Did you think the neighborhood was homey?"
150,Chandler,Hey!
151,Joey,You son of a bitch!
152,Chandler,"Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?"
153,Monica,Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.
154,Rachel,Who's Nancy?
155,Ross,What's going on?
156,Monica,"Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big."
157,Chandler,Yeah  I'm not having an affair.
158,Chandler,Nancy is our realtor.
159,Joey,I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!
160,Phoebe,Why do you have a realtor?
161,Monica,"Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city."
162,Joey,What?
163,Rachel,Are you serious?
164,Monica,"When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city."
165,Phoebe,So you're gonna move?
166,Ross,Oh my God.
167,Joey,Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?
168,Rachel,What is wrong with raising a kid in the city?
169,Rachel,"I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!"
170,Monica,"And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset..."
171,Chandler,...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
172,Ross,So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?
173,Phoebe,Have you thought about what you would be giving up?
174,Phoebe,"You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am?"
175,Phoebe,Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?
176,Ross,"You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay."
177,Joey,"No, no, it's not, don't listen to him!"
178,Joey,I'm gonna thump you!
179,Ross,"It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be."
180,Chandler,"Actually, we already found a house we love."
181,Ross,What?
182,Monica,"And about an hour ago, we made an offer."
183,Chandler,"Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?"
184,Chandler,TIME LAPSE
185,Ross,You put an offer on a house?
186,Monica,It's so sweet.
187,Monica,It really is.
188,Monica,It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees...
189,Phoebe,Wha..?
190,Phoebe,"Again with the nature, what are you?"
191,Phoebe,Beavers?
192,Chandler,I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
193,Joey,Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food?
194,Joey,"Because I can stop doing that,  I really, really think I can!"
195,Chandler,You know that's not the reason Joe.
196,Monica,"We think if you saw it, you'd understand."
197,Monica,I mean you guys were there.
198,Monica,"It is beautiful, isn't it?"
199,Rachel,Yeah it is.
200,Joey,What the hell are you doin'?
201,Rachel,"Well, it is, all right?"
202,Rachel,"When we were out there today, all I kept thinking"
203,Phoebe,"Yeah, but so is this."
204,Ross,"Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here."
205,Ross,"I mean, how can you leave this place?"
206,Rachel,"C'mon Daddy, listen to me!"
207,Rachel,"All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe!"
208,Rachel,"You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'."
209,Rachel,"And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe?"
210,Rachel,"What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know?"
211,Rachel,Or a- or a hat!
212,Rachel,"No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!"
213,Ross,You can see where he'd have trouble.
214,Rachel,Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
215,Monica,"Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica..."
216,Ross,"That money is mine, Green!"
217,Rachel,"You're fly is open, Geller!"
218,Phoebe,"You guys, you know what I just realized?"
219,Phoebe,'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.'
220,Phoebe,Coincidence?
221,Chandler,"Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!"
222,Phoebe,"Eww, look."

246,Monica,"How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?"
247,Rachel,Oooohh that’s interesting.

361,Monica,Can I ask you a question?
362,Chandler,Sure!
363,Monica,What the hell is that dog doing here?
364,Chandler,Little toast here.
365,Chandler,"I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting."
366,Chandler,"Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?"
367,Chandler,So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
368,Ross,"And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas."
369,Rachel,And a crappy New Year.
370,Chandler,"Here, here!"

377,Ross,"You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better."
378,Ross,"And now when I look over, who am I gonna see?"
379,Ross,"The Gottliebs, the Yangs?"
380,Ross,They don't make me feel so good.
381,Rachel,Yeah.
382,Rachel,"So don't move, okay?"
383,Rachel,Just stay here and...  maybe close your blinds at night.

392,Monica,"Well, there you go."
393,Joey,I'm really sorry you guys.
394,Ross,Yeah.

398,Phoebe,You're gonna be okay?
399,Monica,"Yeah, we'll be okay."
400,Ross,Love you guys.
401,Joey,"You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before."
402,Chandler,"That's okay, we understand."
403,Joey,And about this Nancy thing...
404,Joey,"If you're not sleeping with her, should I?"
405,Monica,"I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so..."

60,Chandler,"Well, it's not like I went to Spain."
61,Chandler,"I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back."
62,Joey,"What's the big deal, sit somewhere else."
63,Chandler,"The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat."
64,Joey,"Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there ."
65,Joey,Soo...
66,Ross,"You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops."

80,Monica,Has somebody been drinking my fat?
81,Rachel,"You guys,  does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?"
82,Phoebe,"I don't know, you might be the first one."
83,Monica,"Rach, did you check the machine?"
84,Rachel,"Uh, no."
85,Rachel,"Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat."
86,Rachel,Nevermind.

107,Monica,What if it's new?
108,Monica,"I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say."

110,Chandler,"Honey, you did call him back."
111,Chandler,"'Cause, it's, it's really old."

161,Phoebe,I got the hummus.
162,Rachel,Ooooh!
163,Rachel,"Honey, well we'll find you something."
164,Rachel,Do you wanna wear my black jacket?
165,Phoebe,That won't go with this dress though.
166,Rachel,"No, you're right."
167,Rachel,"Well, we'll find something."
168,Rachel,Let's just get you out of that.
169,Rachel,Come on.
170,Ross,"No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes."
171,Rachel,"Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?"
172,Monica,I called him.
173,Monica,Yes.
174,Monica,Well I got his machine and I left a message.
175,Monica,"But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message."
176,Monica,It was breezy!
177,Monica,"Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?"
178,Phoebe,"Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place."
179,Monica,"Here, I got it."
180,Monica,"I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough."
181,Joey,"Monica, how are you gonna do that?"
182,Monica,I know the code to his answering machine.
183,Ross,"Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the..."
184,Ross,"Okay, you're dialing, you are dialing."
185,Joey,"Wow, what a cool job."
186,Joey,'You have two new messages.'
187,Joey,"'Please, pass the pie.'"
188,Monica,"""Hi, it's Monica."
189,Monica,I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what.
190,Monica,"So, I'm just checkin'."
191,Monica,"So let me know, or don't, whatever."
192,Monica,"I'm breezy."""
193,Joey,"Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy."
194,Joey,Woman's
195,Joey,Now she sounded breezy.
196,Joey,Commercial Break
197,Monica,He's seeing someone.
198,Monica,I can't believe he's seeing someone.
199,Phoebe,"Monica, you don't know that."
200,Monica,"Well, who's voice was that?"
201,Chandler,Maybe it was his sister's.
202,Chandler,"You know, maybe it was his daughter's."
203,Monica,Michelle!
204,Monica,"Of course, it was Michelle!"
205,Monica,Did it sound like Michelle?
206,Ross,"Oh, great."
207,Ross,"It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab."
208,Monica,It was Michelle.
209,Monica,It was definitely Michelle.
210,Rachel,"Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress."
211,Rachel,"If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one."
212,Rachel,"Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?"
213,Ross,"You don't, you don't know what your wearing?"
214,Rachel,"Well, hon-ey."
215,Rachel,I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
216,Ross,"Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes."
217,Ross,"All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you."
218,Chandler,"All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed."
219,Chandler,"I, in turn, have noticed that you are not."
220,Chandler,So in the words of A.
221,Chandler,"A. Milne, ""Get out of my chair, dillhole!"""
222,Joey,Okay.
223,Chandler,What are you doing?
224,Joey,"You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions."
225,Chandler,The cushions are the essence of the chair!
226,Joey,That's right!
227,Joey,I'm taking the essence.
228,Chandler,"Oh-ho, it'll be back."
229,Chandler,"Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room."
230,Ross,"Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty."
231,Rachel,"Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep."
232,Ross,"Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep."
233,Rachel,"Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days."
234,Phoebe,"Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me!"
235,Rachel,"Oh, it's perfect!"
236,Rachel,But not for tonight.
237,Phoebe,"Well, of course not for tonight."
238,Phoebe,"Yeah, hi!"
239,Ross,Not for tonight.
240,Ross,Not for tonight!
241,Ross,"Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?"
242,Rachel,"No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it."
243,Rachel,I love you.
244,Rachel,I love you.
245,Chandler,We used them as pillows when we went camping.
246,Ross,What?
247,Chandler,The sheep.
248,Ross,"Hey, what you do on your own time..."
249,Joey,Where's my underwear?
250,Ross,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
251,Ross,"Come on, come on, what."
252,Ross,You took his underwear?
253,Chandler,He took my essence!
254,Ross,"Okay, now hold on."
255,Ross,"Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?"
256,Joey,"Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now."
257,Ross,"Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?"
258,Joey,It's a rented tux.
259,Joey,Okay.
260,Joey,I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
261,Chandler,"Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions."
262,Joey,"Okay, you hide my clothes."
263,Joey,I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
264,Chandler,"What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?"
265,Joey,"Hey, opposite, is opposite!"
266,Chandler,He's got nothing!
267,Phoebe,"Okay, I'm ready."
268,Phoebe,Ross and
269,Chandler,"Oh, aaaah!"
270,Phoebe,"Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'"
271,Chandler,What are you supporting?
272,Phoebe,Duh!!
273,Phoebe,Christmas!
274,Ross,"Okay, hey, that's okay with me."
275,Ross,"Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped."
276,Ross,My watch.
277,Ross,"Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more."
278,Ross,What time is it?
279,Ross,It's
280,Rachel,"Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear?"
281,Rachel,The black or the purple?
282,Ross,"Just, just, just pick one!"
283,Phoebe,"Okay, okay, okay, the black."
284,Phoebe,"But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?"
285,Rachel,"Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants."
286,Rachel,Maybe I should wear pants?
287,Ross,"Yeah, pants, what, what an idea."
288,Ross,"Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants."
289,Ross,"Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay."
290,Ross,"No, no I don't care if they match."
291,Ross,I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat.
292,Ross,Okay.
293,Rachel,But I...
294,Ross,"No, no, no just do it."
295,Ross,Go in there and pick something out so we can go.
296,Rachel,All right.
297,Ross,Thank you!
298,Monica,Okay.
299,Monica,I gotta call Michelle.
300,Monica,I gotta see if that was her voice or not.
301,Monica,"I'm sorry, I just have to."
302,Ross,"It was, it was her voice."
303,Chandler,"Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place."
304,Monica,Okay.
305,Monica,That was her right?
306,Phoebe,Definitely.
307,Monica,See there you go.
308,Monica,Woo!
309,Monica,We're out of the woods.
310,Monica,"Okay, I'll get dressed now."
311,Ross,Yay!
312,Phoebe,"I'll get it, okay."
313,Phoebe,"Hi, Monica and Rachel's."
314,Phoebe,"Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling."
315,Phoebe,"Oh, ew, it's Michelle!"
316,Phoebe,Ew!
317,Phoebe,"She, she must have that Caller Id thing."
318,Phoebe,You should get that.
319,Monica,"Uh, Michelle."
320,Monica,"Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake."
321,Monica,"Oh, you're so sweet."
322,Monica,"Yeah, we were a great couple."
323,Monica,I know I really miss him.
324,Monica,"Well, you know how it is, it's that...."
325,Chandler,You know what's weird.
326,Chandler,Donald Duck never wore pants.
327,Chandler,"But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist."
328,Chandler,"I mean, what is that about?"
329,Monica,"Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message."
330,Monica,I mean that's allowed.
331,Monica,Yeah-huh!
332,Monica,"I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about."
333,Monica,"What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this?"
334,Monica,Come on we're friends!!
335,Monica,That bitch always hated me.
336,Monica,I'm calling her back.
337,Ross,"No, no, no, no."
338,Ross,"Tick, tick, tick, tick."
339,Monica,"Okay, fine."
340,Chandler,"They got a phone in there, right?"
341,Phoebe,"Okay, we're on it."
342,Phoebe,We're on it.
343,Ross,Um.
344,Ross,"I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um."
345,Rachel,I'm not gonna gooo.
346,Ross,You're not going to go.
347,Rachel,"No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence."
348,Ross,"How, how, um how can you not be going?"
349,Rachel,"I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going."
350,Ross,"Um, you know, just out of curiosity..."
351,Rachel,"Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood."
352,Ross,Right.
353,Ross,"Right, okay, okay."
354,Ross,I'm sorry.
355,Ross,I'm sorry I yelled.
356,Rachel,It's fine.
357,Ross,"No, but, your-your mad."
358,Rachel,I'm not mad.
359,Ross,No.
360,Rachel,I'm just not going.
361,Ross,Your not going.
362,Rachel,Right.
363,Ross,Okay.
364,Ross,You know that I-I have to go.
365,Rachel,"Um, hum."
366,Ross,Right.
367,Ross,So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'
368,Rachel,No.
369,Ross,"No, because your not upset."
370,Rachel,Right.
371,Ross,About the yelling.
372,Rachel,"Right, and the humiliating."
373,Ross,"Oh, well of course, the humiliating."
374,Ross,"So, so wee, we're okay."
375,Rachel,"Um, hum."
376,Ross,We're good.
377,Rachel,Right.
378,Ross,Okay.
379,Ross,Honey?
380,Rachel,"Yes, Ross."
381,Ross,I love you.
382,Phoebe,Get away from that!
383,Phoebe,No!
384,Phoebe,She's just getting dressed.
385,Chandler,Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
386,Joey,"Okay, buddy-boy."
387,Joey,Here it is.
388,Joey,"You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own."
389,Chandler,Oh my God!
390,Chandler,That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!
391,Joey,Look at me!
392,Joey,I'm Chandler!
393,Joey,Could I be wearing any more clothes?
394,Joey,Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
395,Chandler,Oooo-ooh!
396,Joey,Yeah.
397,Joey,"Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on."
398,Joey,"I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges."
399,Ross,"Okay, okay."
400,Ross,"Enough, enough with the lunging."
401,Ross,No!
402,Ross,I'm sick of this.
403,Ross,Okay.
404,Ross,I've had it up to here with you two!
405,Ross,Neither you can come to the party!
406,Chandler,"Jeez, what a baby."
407,Joey,"Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it."
408,Joey,I was just going to get dressed.
409,Ross,You know what I don't care.
410,Ross,"The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go."
411,Ross,"Look Rach, I'm sorry."
412,Ross,Okay.
413,Ross,"Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk."
414,Ross,I'm sorry I yelled.
415,Ross,"I want you there, I need you there."
416,Ross,"Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there."
417,Joey,You could drink the fat.
418,Ross,"Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation."
419,Rachel,"No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute."
420,Rachel,"That actually, uh, that sounds interesting."
421,Ross,What?
422,Rachel,I think you should drink the fat.
423,Joey,Yaaaay!
424,Ross,"Okay, okay."
425,Ross,"If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there."
426,Ross,Then that's what I'll do.
427,Phoebe,"Oh, wait, let me get you another glass."
428,Phoebe,That's been sitting out.
429,Ross,I think this will be fine.
430,Ross,"Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it."
431,Ross,Cheers.
432,Rachel,"No, no, no, wait!"
433,Rachel,"Okay, okay."
434,Rachel,Don't!
435,Rachel,"I'll go, I'll go!"
436,Ross,You will?
437,Rachel,"You were really gonna do that, weren't you?"
438,Ross,"Well, yeah."
439,Rachel,You were gonna drink the fat.
440,Joey,Let's see what else he'll do!
441,Ross,"How 'bout instead you, go get changed!"
442,Ross,"You, give him back his underwear!"
443,Ross,"I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes!"
444,Ross,Monica!
445,Chandler,Stop it.
446,Chandler,Stop it!
447,Phoebe,"Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing!"
448,Phoebe,"No, Monica, no!"
449,Monica,Not any more!
450,Monica,"Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know."
451,Monica,"Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest."
452,Monica,"I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing."
453,Monica,"Okay, bye."
454,Monica,Outgoing!
455,Monica,Did that say outgoing?!
456,Monica,"Not, outgoing!!"
457,Monica,"""Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know."""
458,Monica,Nooo!
459,Phoebe,How did you do that?
460,Monica,I don't know!
461,Monica,Noooo!!!
462,Ross,"Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people."
463,Ross,Go!
464,Ross,Go!
465,Ross,Go!
466,Monica,Maybe we could call the phone company.
467,Monica,Maybe they could change the message.
468,Monica,Maybe they can change his number.
469,Phoebe,"Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself."
470,Ross,Rachel!!
471,Ross,Wow!
472,Ross,"You, uh, you look, wow!"
473,Rachel,And I still have about five seconds to spare.
474,Rachel,"Okay, that was about seven seconds."
475,Ross,So we're a little late.
476,Rachel,Come on.
477,Rachel,Oh!
478,Rachel,"And, uh, by the way...."
479,Ross,What?

23,Rachel,"Oh, Pheebs, baby, that's nice but, you know what,    I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?"
24,Phoebe,"I would, but you're the last one."
25,Rachel,GIVE ME THE BOOK!
26,Rachel,"Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, ""Guy-in-van""?"
27,Phoebe,"Oh, my first love!"
28,Rachel,Oh!
29,Monica,What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?
30,Phoebe,Dead.
31,Phoebe,"Oh, it's OK, no,   he  was old, yeah!"
32,Phoebe,"And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave   at Omaha Beach."
33,Chandler,"Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my    black book when I got married!"
34,Chandler,Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin.
35,Chandler,With Janice's phone number on it.
36,Rachel,"Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?"
37,Phoebe,"Oh yes, they are."
38,Phoebe,OPENING CREDITS
39,Chandler,Hey honey!
40,Joey,Hi sweetie!
41,Chandler,Is Monica not here?
42,Joey,No.
43,Chandler,"Oh, then I'll tell you."
44,Chandler,My agency was bidding for   a big account and they got it!
45,Chandler,It's my first national commercial!
46,Joey,Cool!
47,Chandler,"Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas    were mine!"
48,Chandler,"Hell, you weren't there?"
49,Chandler,All the ideas were   mine!!
50,Joey,That's great!
51,Joey,"Hey, can you cast me in it?"
52,Chandler,Oh...
53,Chandler,"I don't know, I really don't think you're    right for the part."
54,Joey,What do you mean?
55,Joey,"I can do anything, I'm a chameleon!"
56,Joey,Huh?
57,Joey,I'm old!
58,Joey,I'm tired!
59,Joey,"Hey, I'm hot  I'm cold!!"
60,Joey,Huh??
61,Joey,Come on!
62,Joey,What can't I do?
63,Chandler,First of all.
64,Chandler,Bravo.
65,Chandler,"Uh, but I really don't think    you're right for this."
66,Chandler,The part calls for a stuffy college professor.
67,Joey,I can do that!
68,Joey,"""Hello, I'm    your professor."
69,Joey,When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing.
70,Joey,"I like to use..."" Oh, what's the product?"
71,Chandler,Software that facilitates inter-business networking    e-solutions?
72,Joey,I'm cold!
73,Ross,Hey!
74,Ross,Guess who's a finalist for a huge research   grant!
75,Ross,"I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you."
76,Ross,"Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds    of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with."
77,Ross,Not      that I'm keeping score or anything... five!
78,Ross,"Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars."
79,Ross,"And if I get    it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research!"
80,Ross,"And there    will be  an article about me in the ""Paleontology Review""!"
81,Ross,Yeah!
82,Ross,"That'll be  the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious    questions    about my work!"
83,Ross,Yeah.
84,Ross,Why?
85,Ross,Your ex-boyfriend?
86,Ross,"So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new    boyfriend gets this grant?"
87,Ross,"Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!"
88,Ross,"Well, if you think it would help."
89,Ross,"Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know,    butter him up?"
90,Ross,Anything he really likes?
91,Ross,We'll see how dinner goes.
92,Phoebe,Hey!
93,Monica,"Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?"
94,Phoebe,"Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing    out stuff, so Mike could move in."
95,Monica,"Oh, right."
96,Phoebe,Yeah.
97,Monica,"Oh, well."
98,Monica,Now that I'm here I might as well help you    with the cleaning and organizing!
99,Monica,Just happen to have my label maker!
100,Phoebe,"Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff!"
101,Phoebe,Did   you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?
102,Monica,"Uh, Chandler did!"
103,Monica,What does he want you  to give  up?
104,Phoebe,A bunch of stuff.
105,Phoebe,And the worst one... he wants me    to get rid of Gladys.
106,Monica,Who's Gladys?
107,Monica,Oh!
108,Monica,What a tragic loss!
109,Phoebe,Yeah.
110,Phoebe,I really hate to give her up.
111,Phoebe,"Oh,   I know!!"
112,Phoebe,"Oh, you should take her!"
113,Monica,"Well, I-I-I-I..."
114,Monica,I don't know...
115,Phoebe,"Why, you don't like her?"
116,Monica,"Well, of course I do."
117,Monica,What's not to like!
118,Monica,I'll    take her in a minute!
119,Monica,"But, you know, I think that you're giving up too    easy, honey."
120,Monica,I think that you need to fight for her!
121,Phoebe,Really?
122,Phoebe,You think?
123,Monica,Absolutely!
124,Monica,"Yes, you say to him ""I'm sorry    Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!"""
125,Phoebe,"Ok, I'll fight for her."
126,Phoebe,Ok!
127,Phoebe,"Oh, wait, oh I just    realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her."
128,Monica,"Damn it, I did not think this through!"
129,Chandler,Hey you guys.
130,Rachel,Hi!
131,Joey,Oh!
132,Joey,Any word on casting yet?
133,Chandler,"Joe, I told you, you're just not right for    the part."
134,Joey,What do you mean?
135,Joey,"Rach, don't I seem like a professor    you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?"
136,Rachel,"I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna    be interested in."
137,Rachel,Joey
138,Chandler,Joe...
139,Joey,"Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't    pass it on to your bosses!"
140,Chandler,Fine!
141,Joey,Thank you.
142,Chandler,"Work, Joe!"
143,Joey,Damn it!
144,Joey,Chandler
145,Joey,Just pass it to your boss!
146,Chandler,He's not right for the part.
147,Chandler,"So if I suggest    him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot!"
148,Chandler,And that's something they should    learn on their own!
149,Rachel,"Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked    it, but your bosses didn't."
150,Rachel,"Then that way, you're the good guy and    they're the bad guys."
151,Chandler,That's good!
152,Chandler,"I liked it, they didn't."
153,Chandler,"Joey, for God's sake,    go to work!"
154,Ross,I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart.
155,Ross,I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner    party.
156,Ross,Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley    or C3PO?
157,Ross,"Well, I..."
158,Ross,I am having a good hair day.
159,Ross,I'm ok.
160,Ross,It's an honor to meet you.
161,Ross,"I can't tell    you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize,     whoooo!"
162,Ross,"I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of    the reasons I got into the field."
163,Ross,"No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image,    you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz-zzz,    mmm."
164,Ross,"Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert."
165,Ross,"See, there are still several areas that haven't    been fully excavated."
166,Ross,What?
167,Ross,"Did you just say ""break up with Charlie""?"
168,Ross,"Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?"
169,Ross,Are you serious?
170,Ross,No!
171,Phoebe,Hi!
172,Phoebe,"Sorry, I'm late."
173,Monica,"Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you    keep the painting?"
174,Phoebe,"No, he really hates it."
175,Phoebe,But he's gonna let me    keep my box of human hair!
176,Phoebe,So you got to pick your battles.
177,Phoebe,"But the good news    is, Gladys is yours!"
178,Monica,"Wow, what's the bad news!"
179,Rachel,Who's Gladys?
180,Phoebe,"Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know,    with the woman coming out of the frame."
181,Rachel,"Oh, and Monica gets to keep her?"
182,Rachel,In her house?
183,Rachel,I am so jealous!
184,Phoebe,"Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!"
185,Monica,Huh!
186,Rachel,"Well, I mean, sure, of course."
187,Rachel,"But... you already    gave that to Monica, so..."
188,Monica,"You know, I would give her up, for you."
189,Rachel,"No, I couldn't let you do that."
190,Monica,But I want to.
191,Rachel,But I don't want you to.
192,Monica,But I insist!
193,Rachel,But I insist harder!
194,Phoebe,"Girls, girls, stop, ok?"
195,Phoebe,We'll flip a coin.
196,Phoebe,"Heads,    she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's."
197,Phoebe,Tails!
198,Phoebe,"Monica, she's yours!"
199,Monica,"No, that landed in your food!"
200,Rachel,"No, no, that's ok. You won fair    and square."
201,Rachel,I'm so sad!
202,Chandler,Hey Joe!
203,Joey,What's up?
204,Chandler,Bad news.
205,Chandler,I watched the tape and passed it along    to my bosses and they weren't interested.
206,Joey,Oh.
207,Chandler,I'm sorry man.
208,Joey,"But, ehm... you watched    the tape?"
209,Chandler,Yeah!
210,Chandler,I...
211,Chandler,I...
212,Chandler,I liked it!
213,Chandler,"But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it."
214,Chandler,Stupid sons of bitches!
215,Joey,You didn't watch the tape.
216,Chandler,What!?
217,Chandler,Of course I did!
218,Joey,"Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?"
219,Chandler,"I'm not lying to you, I watched it!"
220,Joey,"Well, you lied again!"
221,Chandler,I watched it!
222,Joey,Keep going Pinocchio!
223,Chandler,I did!
224,Joey,No you didn't!
225,Chandler,"I'm telling you, I watched the tape."
226,Rachel,Did you watch the tape?
227,Ross,I guess!
228,Ross,What?
229,Ross,I...
230,Ross,I...
231,Ross,May 12th?
232,Ross,Wha..?
233,Ross,I need 6 graduate students.
234,Ross,Wha...?
235,Ross,"Wait, wait, wait, just a minute."
236,Ross,None of my    questions have anything to do with Paleontology.
237,Ross,um...
238,Ross,"I've never heard of a ""Boscodictiasaur""."
239,Ross,Ok.  B - O - S ...
240,Ross,Oh come on!
241,Chandler,I can't believe Joey.
242,Chandler,I hate being called a liar!
243,Rachel,But you are a liar.
244,Chandler,What did I just say?
245,Joey,You still here?
246,Chandler,"Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt."
247,Chandler,I am    insulted.
248,Chandler,When I tell somebody I did something...
249,Joey,"Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok?"
250,Joey,"First, you lied, right?"
251,Joey,"Then, you lied about lying, ok?"
252,Joey,"Then you lied about    lying about lying, ok?"
253,Joey,So before you lie about lying about lying about lying    about... lying...   Stop lying!
254,Chandler,Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
255,Joey,You wanna know wh...?
256,Joey,You wanna know why?
257,Rachel,"Well, this is going well."
258,Joey,"Here's how I know you didn't    watch the tape, ok?"
259,Joey,"If you had seen what was on this    tape, believe me, you would have some comments."
260,Joey,"Alright, now remember, I    got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan."
261,Joey,(The
262,Joey,And that's how I know you    didn't watch the tape!
263,Chandler,He really is a chameleon.
264,Phoebe,"Well, Gladys say hello to    your new home!"
265,Monica,"Oh, my!"
266,Rachel,Wow!
267,Rachel,"Oh,    she's so nice and big!"
268,Rachel,"Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh    so proudly?"
269,Monica,I haven't really settled on a spot yet!
270,Rachel,"Well, hey!"
271,Rachel,How about right above the TV?
272,Rachel,"That way, it will be    the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!"
273,Phoebe,"Yeah, yeah!"
274,Phoebe,And you can    get rid of that French poster.
275,Monica,I like that poster!
276,Phoebe,Really?
277,Phoebe,It doesn't have anything coming out of it.
278,Phoebe,Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?
279,Rachel,Oh!
280,Rachel,There's    nothing above your bed!
281,Monica,Are you still here?
282,Ross,Oh hi!
283,Ross,Hello!
284,Ross,"Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology    related questions?"
285,Ross,"Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps?"
286,Ross,Aunt Margaret's pants size?
287,Ross,No!
288,Ross,Stop!
289,Ross,Really?
290,Ross,I have to break up with Charlie?
291,Ross,You're crazy.
292,Ross,Crazy!
293,Ross,Get out!
294,Rachel,O-oh my God!
295,Joey,What?
296,Rachel,"Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?"
297,Joey,I got it from Monica.
298,Joey,She sold it to me for a very    reasonable price.
299,Rachel,"Joey, we're not keeping this!"
300,Joey,But it's an original Buffay...
301,Rachel,"Alright, fine."
302,Rachel,You can keep it.
303,Rachel,As long as you don't    mind that she's haunted.
304,Joey,Hey?
305,Joey,what?
306,Joey,what?
307,Joey,wey!
308,Joey,whoo!
309,Joey,what?
310,Joey,what!
311,Rachel,"Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive    when you're asleep."
312,Rachel,"She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body    across the floor, just looking for legs to steal."
313,Rachel,"And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your    doorknob."
314,Joey,GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!
315,Monica,Hey!
316,Monica,I sold that to Joey.
317,Rachel,"Well, why I told him it's haunted."
318,Rachel,Two can play at    this game.
319,Monica,"No, too late."
320,Monica,You can't give it back!
321,Rachel,Yes I can!
322,Monica,No you can't.
323,Monica,She's yours!
324,Rachel,She's yours!
325,Monica,SHE'S YOURS!
326,Rachel,She's yours!
327,Phoebe,Hey!
328,Rachel,She's mine!
329,Monica,She's m-i-i-ne!
330,Rachel,She's mine!
331,Monica,She's mine!
332,Phoebe,You guys!
333,Phoebe,You guys!
334,Phoebe,You don't have to fight over her    anymore.
335,Phoebe,Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis.
336,Rachel,I want Gladys!
337,Monica,She's mine!
338,Rachel,She's mine!
339,Monica,She's mine!
340,Rachel,She's mine!
341,Chandler,"Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape."
342,Chandler,"And    I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part    or not."
343,Joey,That's not the point Chandler.
344,Joey,The point is that you    lied.
345,Chandler,I know.
346,Chandler,You're right.
347,Chandler,What's it gonna take for you    to forgive me?
348,Monica,Oh my God!
349,Rachel,Excellent!
350,Joey,"Now, what do you say?"
351,Chandler,Lying is wrong!
352,Joey,And?...
353,Joey,AND?
354,Chandler,I'm a pretty little girl.
355,Phoebe,I knew it!
356,Ross,Your ex-boyfriend is insane.
357,Ross,"No I didn't, and you want to know why?"
358,Ross,Because your    ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.
359,Ross,Yeah.
360,Ross,"He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't    give you up."
361,Ross,Really?
362,Ross,"Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review,    who was the voice of ""Underdog""?"
363,Ross,"If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay?"
364,Ross,"I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question."
365,Ross,"Oh, I'm sorry, no."
366,Ross,He did ask me one.
367,Ross,Uhm... How do    you spell Mboscodictiosaur?
368,Ross,Damnit!
369,Ross,I want you to tell her everything.
370,Ross,"About the deal you    tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox!"
371,Ross,That's the    voice of Underdog!
372,Ross,"No, no, no."
373,Ross,Don't do that!
374,Ross,"I want you to look her in    the eyes, and tell her the truth."
375,Ross,"Too little, too late, Benji!"
376,Ross,No!
377,Ross,What?
378,Ross,or...
379,Ross,"Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a    little uncomfortable."
380,Ross,"Okay, that's it."
381,Ross,WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!

1,Chandler,Yeah.
2,Ross,"Yeah, what, what was I thinking?"
3,Joey,Hey!
4,Joey,"So, what's with the 20 percent tip?"
5,Joey,Did I do something wrong?
6,Chandler,Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
7,Joey,Y'know what's more generous than that?!
8,Joey,Fifty percent!
9,Joey,Y'know what's even more generous than that?!
10,Chandler,I see where you're goin'!
11,Ross,What's up with the greed Joe?
12,Joey,"All right, look I'm sorry you guys, but it's just that I gotta get these new head shots made."
13,Joey,"And they're really expensive, y'know?"
14,Joey,I'm down to like three!
15,Joey,"Well, actually two cause one of em I kinda blackened in some teethWhy did I do that?"
16,Ross,Well isn't there something you can do to earn a little extra money?
17,Ross,"I mean, can't-can't you pick up, I don't know, an extra shift here?"
18,Phoebe,"Or, y'know, I used to beg for money."
19,Phoebe,Of course it helps if you've got y'know a little of this  goin' on.
20,Phoebe,Wow!
21,Phoebe,I still have it!

30,Chandler,"Ah, finally an explanation."
31,Joey,No-no!
32,Joey,"I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember?"
33,Joey,"Let's see uh, well I don't want to donate sperm again."
34,Joey,I really prefer doing that at the home office y'know?
35,Joey,"Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?"
36,Joey,Yeah?
37,Joey,Uhh do it?
38,Joey,"Well, where was I?"
39,Joey,Opening Credits
40,Ross,Hi!
41,Phoebe,Hey!
42,Ross,"Hey, what have you guys been up to?"
43,Phoebe,Ohh!
44,Phoebe,We went to a self-defense class today!
45,Ross,Wow!
46,Rachel,"Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!"
47,Joey,Takes it out of you?
48,Phoebe,"Now, we can kick anybody's ass!"
49,Rachel,Yeah!
50,Ross,After one class?
51,Ross,I don't think so.
52,Rachel,What?
53,Rachel,You wanna see me self-defend myself?!
54,Rachel,Go over there  and pretend you're a sexual predator!
55,Rachel,Go on!
56,Rachel,I dare ya!
57,Ross,"Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that's not enough."
58,Ross,"Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there's a concept you should really be familiar with."
59,Ross,It's what the Japanese call  unagi.
60,Rachel,Isn't that a kind of sushi?
61,Ross,"No, it's a concept!"
62,Phoebe,Yeah it is!
63,Phoebe,It is!
64,Phoebe,It's freshwater eel!
65,Ross,"All right, maybe it means that too"
66,Rachel,Ohh!
67,Rachel,I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
68,Ross,Y'know what?
69,Ross,Fine!

71,Ross,I don't even care!
72,Phoebe,Come on Ross.
73,Phoebe,We're sorry.
74,Phoebe,Please tell us what it is.
75,Ross,Unagi is a state of total awareness.
76,Ross,Okay?
77,Ross,Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
78,Phoebe,You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
79,Ross,"All I'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don't know, like a  surprise!"
80,Ross,"All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn't mean you have unagi."
81,Rachel,Ooh!
82,Rachel,Y'know what?
83,Rachel,"If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour."
84,Ross,Y'know what
85,Chandler,"Hey-hey, is Monica here?"
86,Phoebe,No.
87,Ross,No.

179,Ross,I made it in the sixth grade.
180,Chandler,"Yeah, I guess I could use that."
181,Chandler,I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
182,Ross,"Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon."
183,Ross,"But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely."
184,Chandler,"Wait a minute, I can't give this to her."
185,Ross,Why not?
186,Chandler,"Because it says ""Captain Ross"" on the side and ""I hate Monica"" on the bottom."

196,Phoebe,"Like she's really mean, and she's over critical, and-andNo!"
197,Phoebe,She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!
198,Ross,Okay.
199,Phoebe,And!
200,Phoebe,She uses sex as a weapon!
201,Ross,Fine!
202,Ross,Thank you for warning me.
203,Ross,At breakfast I'll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
204,Phoebe,You're still gonna go out with her?
205,Ross,Yeah!
206,Phoebe,"Well, didn't you just hear what I said?"
207,Ross,Pheebs come on!
208,Ross,"I mean, consider the source!"
209,Ross,Of course her ex-husband's gonna say that stuff.
210,Ross,"Now, if you'll excuse me"
211,Phoebe,No listen to me!
212,Phoebe,She is crazy!
213,Phoebe,You see?
214,Phoebe,Nothing is good enough for her!
215,Rachel,Hi Tag!
216,Rachel,"Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?"
217,Rachel,Ohh that's nice.
218,Rachel,Wo-women?
219,Rachel,You mean like old women?
220,Rachel,Oh.
221,Rachel,That's great!
222,Rachel,"Wow man, so Joey must've really taught you some stuff huh?"
223,Rachel,Yeah?
224,Joey,See?
225,Joey,That's a great smile!
226,Joey,Easy.
227,Joey,Natural.
228,Joey,"Now, pretend I have a camera."
229,Joey,You're changing it!
230,Chandler,I can't help it!
231,Joey,"All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?"
232,Chandler,Borrow money from me?
233,Joey,"Okay, firstfirst of all, you want to make it look spontaneous."
234,Joey,"I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up."
235,Joey,See?
236,Joey,"All right, now you try."
237,Joey,"Look down , you're looking down, keep looking down"
238,Chandler,Why is there jelly on your shoe?
239,Joey,I had a donut.
240,Rachel,Hi!
241,Joey,Hey!
242,Chandler,Hey!
243,Rachel,"So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night."
244,Joey,Yeah!
245,Joey,That guy's all right!
246,Rachel,Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
247,Joey,What?
248,Rachel,"Y'know, all the women."
249,Joey,"Hey well, you can't teach someone to be good with women."
250,Joey,"Y'know, that's why I never had any luck with Chandler."
251,Chandler,I'm right here!
252,Rachel,"All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again?"
253,Rachel,"Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it's justAnd I know he's my assistant and I can't date himbut it just bothers me, all right?"
254,Joey,Hey!
255,Joey,"No-no-no-no, you can't take him away from me!"
256,Joey,I got a great partner to pick up girls with!
257,Joey,Finally!
258,Chandler,I'm still right here!
259,Rachel,"All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!"
260,Joey,What?
261,Rachel,I just don't want him to meet anybody until I am over my crushAnd I will get over it.
262,Rachel,"It's-it's not like I love him, it's just physical!"
263,Rachel,ButI mean I get crushes like this all the time!
264,Rachel,"I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!"
265,Joey,"I know, Monica told me."
266,Chandler,"Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?"
267,Rachel,Yeah.
268,Rachel,Sure.
269,Chandler,Can you people not see me?
270,Rachel,"So, will you talk to him?"
271,Joey,I don't know Rach.
272,Rachel,"Oh, come on!"
273,Rachel,I'll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
274,Joey,One!
275,Joey,No ten!
276,Joey,You said ten!
277,Joey,You can't take that back!
278,Joey,I don't know.
279,Joey,"You uh, you got something for me?"
280,Joey,Ten.
281,Joey,Okay.
282,Joey,Now Tag there's such a thing as to many women.
283,Joey,"Yeah, for you!"
284,Monica,Hey!
285,Monica,There you are!
286,Chandler,There I am!
287,Monica,Are you okay?
288,Chandler,"Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine."
289,Monica,What?
290,Chandler,"Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn."
291,Chandler,Brooklyn is f-far!
292,Monica,"Chandler, what were you thinking?"
293,Chandler,"I don't know, but don't worry, don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now."
294,Chandler,"Okay, see?"
295,Chandler,"Look down , look down, look down"
296,Monica,Chandler?
297,Chandler,Yeah!
298,Phoebe,Hi.
299,Ross,Hi.
300,Phoebe,"So, how are things going with crazy?"
301,Phoebe,Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
302,Ross,"Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okayand F.Y.I she must've shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room!"
303,Ross,"And his response to each one was, ""I don't give a tiny rat's ass."""
304,Phoebe,"Yeah well, maybe she should've spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom."
305,Ross,"Well, I don't think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that's just because I am not emotionally unavailable!"
306,Phoebe,You think he's emotionally unavailable?
307,Ross,I think he can be.
308,Phoebe,"Well, maybe he wouldn't be she didn't bring the office home every night!"
309,Ross,"Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!"
310,Phoebe,"Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997."
311,Ross,I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!!
312,Ross,That was three years ago!
313,Ross,She apologized and she apologized!
314,Ross,What more do you want?!
315,Phoebe,We want the last six years back!
316,Ross,So do we!!
317,Ross,So do we!!
318,Ross,I'm sorry you had to see that.
319,Rachel,Hi!
320,Rachel,"Thanks, hey so uh what'd you do last night?"
321,Rachel,Oh yeah?
322,Rachel,Another night of birdogging the chickas?
323,Rachel,Wow!
324,Rachel,I did not see that coming.
325,Rachel,"Oh no, yes I do!"
326,Rachel,I do!
327,Rachel,"I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying I am happier when uh, y'know?"
328,Rachel,Really?
329,Rachel,Sp-spoil?
330,Rachel,Uh-huh.
331,Rachel,"Well, I-I'm startin' too."
332,Rachel,Yes!
333,Rachel,Hell yes!
334,Rachel,Okay.
335,Rachel,I'd love to!
336,Rachel,Hello?!
337,Rachel,"Oh, yeah!"
338,Rachel,This is gonna be a while.
339,Rachel,Excuse me.
340,Rachel,Yeah!
341,Ross,My God!
342,Phoebe,"Oh, I'm sorry."
343,Phoebe,Is that annoying?
344,Phoebe,"And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?"
345,Ross,Well maybe she wouldn't have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!
346,Phoebe,Oh he knows!
347,Phoebe,For the most part.
348,Phoebe,Both of you together?
349,Ross,Wh-what's up?
350,Ross,Oh just say it Kyle!
351,Phoebe,What about her whining and her constant need for attention?
352,Phoebe,"Oh right, because you're so capable of change."
353,Ross,"Y'know, he hums when he pees!"
354,Ross,"It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever."
355,Ross,"That's all right, we-we don't need you."
356,Ross,"In fact, hey I'm over it already."
357,Phoebe,"Yeah, and y'know what?"
358,Phoebe,I don't give a tiny rat's ass.
359,Ross,I'm sorry.
360,Ross,"Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her."
361,Ross,"Y'know, she did try to use sex as a weapon!"
362,Ross,"Yeah, I hurt my back a little."
363,Phoebe,Oh.
364,Phoebe,"Y'know, he hums while he does other stuff to."
365,Ross,"Yeah, were better off without them."
366,Phoebe,"And y'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!"
367,Ross,Divorced men's club.
368,Phoebe,"Potato, Potaato."
369,Phoebe,Ending Credits
370,Monica,Hey guys check it out!
371,Monica,My mom sent me the paper!
372,Phoebe,"Ooh, let's see it!"
373,Chandler,Ahhh.
374,Monica,Okay.
375,Chandler,"Oh yeah, that looks good."
376,Phoebe,You guys make a very attractive couple.
377,Joey,"Yeah, we look great together."
378,Monica,"Yeah, we really do!"
379,Chandler,Okay.
380,Monica,Wow!
381,Monica,Imagine what our kids would look like!
382,Joey,"Y'know, we don't have to imagine."
383,Chandler,I'm marrying her.
384,Joey,We'll just see.
385,Joey,End
0,Rachel,"Joey, would you slow down?"
1,Rachel,They're not gonna be sold out of papers at one o'clock in the morning.
2,Joey,I'm excited!
3,Joey,I've never gotten reviewed before.
4,Monica,You were so amazing as the king.
5,Monica,"I was really impressed, I was."
6,Phoebe,"Although, you know what?"
7,Phoebe,You might want to consider wearing underwear next time.
8,Phoebe,"Yeah, cause when you sat down on your throne you could kind of see your... royal subject."
9,Joey,"Here it is, here it is."
10,Joey,"The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king."
11,Chandler,"OK, look, that is one guy's opinion, alright."
12,Chandler,"Phoebs, read yours."
13,Phoebe,OK.
14,Phoebe,"The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction..."
15,Chandler,Does anyone have one from a different paper?
16,Chandler,"Ross, read yours."
17,Ross,I don't want to.
18,Rachel,"Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about."
19,Ross,Yeah.
20,Joey,Maybe they do.
21,Joey,I've been doin' this ten years and I haven't gotten anywhere.
22,Joey,There's gotta be a reason.
23,Ross,Oh c'mon.
24,Ross,"Maybe you're just, uhhh... paying your dues."
25,Joey,"No, no, no, it.. it's too hard."
26,Joey,It's not worth it.
27,Joey,I quit.
28,Monica,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait one minute."
29,Monica,Wait a minute.
30,Monica,I believe this will change your mind.
31,Monica,"In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiana was able to achieve brilliant new levels of... continued on page 153... sucking."
32,Monica,Credits
33,Joey,"When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff."
34,Ross,Hiiiiii.
35,Phoebe,Are... are you OK?
36,Ross,"Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work."
37,Ross,A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid.
38,Ross,"Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket!"
39,Ross,"Where is he, what."
40,Ross,"He, he's here, isn't he?"
41,Monica,Maybe.
42,Ross,Don't toy with me.
43,Ross,"Hey, Fun Bobby!"
44,Ross,Not at all!
45,Ross,I love this guy.
46,Ross,"Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!"
47,Monica,You and me both.
48,Phoebe,"Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better."
49,Joey,"No, I'm alright man."
50,Joey,Really.
51,Joey,"Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me...  Alright!"
52,Joey,It still works.
53,Monica,"OK, I'll see you later babe."
54,Phoebe,Fun Bobby is so great.
55,Monica,"Oh, isn't he?"
56,Monica,"Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him."
57,Monica,"I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend."
58,Monica,"Well, at least my cup is half full."
59,Phoebe,Half full of looooovvvvve.
60,Monica,"And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend."
61,Phoebe,Cabin of loooooovvvvve.
62,Rachel,"We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys."
63,Monica,Really?
64,Monica,I only had two glasses.
65,Joey,I just had a glass.
66,Phoebe,Two.
67,Rachel,I had one glass.
68,Chandler,I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.
69,Rachel,"OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles?"
70,Rachel,And yet somehow we went through five?
71,Ross,Oooooh.
72,Joey,Ooooooh.
73,Monica,So what.
74,Monica,So he drank a lot tonight.
75,Ross,"Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand."
76,Phoebe,Yeah.
77,Phoebe,"Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'"
78,Joey,"Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?"
79,Monica,"Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink."
80,Monica,"I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink?"
81,Monica,"Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo."
82,Monica,"Rach, does this have nonfat milk?"
83,Rachel,"Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it."
84,Monica,"Mmmm, no."
85,Rachel,"Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some."
86,Phoebe,"Um, cake."
87,Rachel,"Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake."
88,Monica,You know what?
89,Monica,It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
90,Monica,Bobby.
91,Monica,"Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you."
92,Monica,"So, what are you saying now?"
93,Phoebe,"Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?"
94,Phoebe,"Ooohh, why?"
95,Chandler,Hey.
96,Joey,Hey.
97,Monica,Hey.
98,Phoebe,Hey.
99,Chandler,Guess who's back in show business.
100,Phoebe,"Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?"
101,Chandler,"No, no, Phoebs."
102,Chandler,You know why?
103,Chandler,Cause he's dead.
104,Phoebe,"Oh, no."
105,Chandler,"OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who."
106,Joey,"Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!"
107,Phoebe,"Oh, well, we have to celebrate."
108,Phoebe,You know what we should do?
109,Phoebe,"We should do, like, a soap opera theme."
110,Chandler,"Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia."
111,Phoebe,"Hey Rach, what time do you get off?"
112,Phoebe,We're all gonna do something tonight.
113,Rachel,"Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans."
114,Monica,You have other friends?
115,Rachel,Yeah...
116,Rachel,"I, uhh..."
117,Rachel,I have a...
118,Rachel,I have a date.
119,Monica,What?
120,Joey,With a man?
121,Rachel,What?
122,Rachel,What is so strange about me having a date?
123,Joey,What about Ross?
124,Joey,"I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?"
125,Rachel,"Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him."
126,Rachel,I'm..
127,Rachel,I'm not really anything at him anymore.
128,Monica,What are you talking about?
129,Rachel,I don't know.
130,Rachel,"Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not."
131,Phoebe,But you guys came so close.
132,Rachel,"Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys."
133,Rachel,You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.
134,Rachel,Here he is.
135,Rachel,Hi.
136,Rachel,"Guys, this is Russ."
137,Joey,"Well, I think it went pretty well."
138,Joey,I..
139,Joey,I got a callback for Thursday.
140,Joey,No.
141,Joey,"OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about."
142,Joey,The network casting lady...
143,Joey,"Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but..."
144,Joey,I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me.
145,Joey,And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.
146,Rachel,What's the matter?
147,Monica,It's Fun Bobby.
148,Rachel,"What, isn't he sober?"
149,Monica,"Oh, he's sober alright."
150,Monica,Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
151,Rachel,"Ohhh, OK."
152,Monica,"Alright, here you go, sweetie."
153,Monica,"Oh God, yes!"
154,Phoebe,That is funny.
155,Monica,"Ahhh, hey honey?"
156,Monica,Don't you have to be at your interview now?
157,Chandler,Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.
158,Monica,Oh.... my... God.
159,Phoebe,It's not that bad.
160,Monica,Not that bad?
161,Monica,Did you hear the hammer story?
162,Phoebe,"OK, OK, don't get all squinky."
163,Rachel,Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
164,Monica,But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life.
165,Monica,"I mean, I can't break up with him."
166,Monica,I'm the one who made him quit drinking.
167,Monica,He's dull because of me.
168,Phoebe,"Alright, don't say that."
169,Phoebe,He's probably always been dull.
170,Phoebe,"You just, you know, set it free."
171,Chandler,Hey Ross.... bahhhh!
172,Rachel,"Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?"
173,Phoebe,Rachel?
174,Phoebe,"Um, hi."
175,Rachel,Hi.
176,Phoebe,"OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?"
177,Rachel,Uhh.... waitressing?
178,Phoebe,"Well, yeah, but... no."
179,Phoebe,"I mean, umm... doesn't.... doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?"
180,Rachel,"Huh, Bob Saget?"
181,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah!"
182,Phoebe,"No, no, no, no, oh, oh."
183,Phoebe,"Oh, my, oh!"
184,Ross,What?
185,Ross,What's wrong?
186,Phoebe,"I, OK...."
187,Monica,"She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning."
188,Ross,Alright.
189,Chandler,"Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK.  Ross, Russ."
190,Chandler,"Russ, Ross."
191,Ross,Hi.
192,Ross,"Yes, yes I am."
193,Ross,"Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?"
194,Ross,A date.
195,Ross,"Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date."
196,Chandler,"You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare."
197,Ross,"Yes, yes I am."
198,Ross,And you are a....
199,Monica,See?
200,Monica,They're as different as night and... later that night.
201,Ross,"Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage."
202,Ross,"It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you."
203,Ross,"I, uh, well..."
204,Ross,I...
205,Ross,I met Russ.
206,Rachel,Oh.
207,Ross,"Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people."
208,Rachel,"Well, we're not seeing each other, so...."
209,Ross,"Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know."
210,Ross,"But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal..."
211,Rachel,"Well, yeah, this is the deal."
212,Ross,"OK, well, um, have a nice evening."
213,Rachel,"Um, Russ, you ready?"
214,Rachel,Bye.
215,Monica,Bye.
216,Phoebe,Bye.
217,Ross,She's dating.
218,Ross,She's dating.
219,Chandler,"Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?"
220,Ross,What do you mean?
221,Monica,Do you not see it?
222,Ross,See what?
223,Ross,I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober.
224,Ross,"And it takes him, what?"
225,Ross,Like... like...
226,Ross,"I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence."
227,Chandler,"Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?"
228,Ross,....................Yeah.
229,Chandler,Hey.
230,Joey,Hey.
231,Chandler,"Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry."
232,Joey,"Well, the part's mine if I want it."
233,Chandler,Oh my God!
234,Joey,"Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady."
235,Chandler,Oh my... God?
236,Joey,"Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years!"
237,Joey,"I mean, Days of Our Lives."
238,Joey,That's actually on television.
239,Chandler,"So, what're you gonna do?"
240,Joey,"Well, I guess I could sleep with her..."
241,Joey,"I mean, how could I do that?"
242,Chandler,"Well, I..."
243,Chandler,I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
244,Joey,I've never slept with someone for a part.
245,Chandler,Well is she...
246,Joey,Sorry.
247,Chandler,It's alright.
248,Chandler,Is she good-looking?
249,Joey,"Yeah, she's totally good looking."
250,Joey,"I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast."
251,Joey,"You know, after having slept with her."
252,Chandler,"Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal."
253,Chandler,"Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex."
254,Chandler,"Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas."
255,Joey,I just...
256,Joey,"I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know?"
257,Joey,"I mean, let's say I do make it, alright?"
258,Joey,"I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General."
259,Chandler,Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
260,Joey,"Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it."

339,Joey,I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.
340,Ross,Good for you.

324,Joey,"And so I'm gonna get on this spaceship,  and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels."

4,Monica,Like if the Queen of England comes over.
5,Chandler,"Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint."
6,Monica,"What if something gets broken, they're so expensive."
7,Chandler,What is the point of having them if we never use   them?

61,Monica,"I know, after you left the store, I chose different   ones."
62,Chandler,Why?
63,Monica,"well no offense honey, but your taste is a little   feminine for me."

76,Phoebe,You know?
77,Phoebe,You.
78,Phoebe,you could.

82,Phoebe,You stink at lying.
83,Joey,I do not.
84,Phoebe,Oh really.
85,Phoebe,Okay.
86,Phoebe,let me ask you something.
87,Phoebe,"Yesterday   at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin   was gone-who took it?"
88,Joey,"Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a   raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said ""Hey   don't eat that-that's Phoebe's"" and he said.. <pause> He said.. ""Joey   you stink at lying."""
89,Joey,What am I going to do?
90,Phoebe,"Don't worry, don't worry."
91,Phoebe,We'll come up with a good   lie.
92,Phoebe,I'll help you practice it.
93,Joey,"Oh great, that'd be great."
94,Joey,Thank you.
95,Phoebe,"Sure, what.. what was the work thing?"
96,Joey,"Uh.. <forgetting what the work thing was, rolls   up his sleeve on his right arm and shows Phoebe, she looks>"
97,Phoebe,"""Pick up grandma at the airport""?"

103,Rachel,<grabs   Ross' hand for support> <Amy's cell phone rings>
104,Ross,"Sure, we don't live there but..."
105,Rachel,"Yeah, no."
106,Rachel,Ross has a PhD.
107,Rachel,God she is unbelievable.
108,Ross,"I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD."
109,Rachel,"Oh sure Ross, yeah."
110,Rachel,"If I have a heart attack in a   restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush."
111,Rachel,Amy storms
112,Rachel,What?
113,Rachel,What happened?
114,Ross,Don't say that.
115,Rachel,"Oh Amy, don't cry Amy."
116,Rachel,"Um.. Ross, could I talk   to you in private?"
117,Ross,"Sure, you want to go upstairs?"
118,Ross,<Ross and Rachel go in the kitchen>
119,Rachel,Um look I was thinking..
120,Rachel,If its ok with Monica I   would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.
121,Ross,"You know, I think thats a great idea."
122,Ross,It'll be like   the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.
123,Rachel,Look I know she's a little tough to take.
124,Rachel,"She has   no where else to go, and she's my sister."
125,Rachel,"Alright, she's Emma's aunt."
126,Rachel,And I   would like them to bond.
127,Ross,"Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much."
128,Ross,I   don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.
129,Rachel,"Ross, you know what?"
130,Rachel,She may need one..We're just   going to have to make our peace with that!
131,Rachel,<Rachel grabs Ross' hand for support and starts to cry a little> Monica and Chandler's apartment Rachel opens their
132,Rachel,"Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy."
133,Rachel,"This is   Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon."
134,Monica,Hi.

136,Ross,Hi.
137,Ross,<they hug and kiss on check>  Monica to
138,Joey,"Pheebs, I still need some help here"
139,Phoebe,"Oh right, ok um."
140,Phoebe,Ok so its not just the lie you tell.
141,Phoebe,but its the way you tell it.
142,Phoebe,"For example if you look down at the ground when   you're talking, people know you're lying."
143,Joey,Oh..
144,Joey,I don't know why this is so hard for me.
145,Joey,you know..
146,Joey,I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor.
147,Joey,Phoebe looks
148,Rachel,Oh we just put her down for a nap.
149,Phoebe,Thats a great movie.
150,Phoebe,<she claps> <Joey nods in agreement>
151,Ross,Emma.
152,Ross,Amy turns around to
153,Phoebe,"Emma, Ross wants you."
154,Phoebe,PHOE-BE.
155,Phoebe,Amy turns to Ross and
156,Rachel,Why does she keep making that   noise?
157,Rachel,"Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um,   if something were to happen to Ross or to myself <Ross and Rachel knock   on wood> um you wouldn't get the baby."
158,Ross,"Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would   want Monica and Chandler."
159,Chandler,I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
160,Monica,"yeah oh my god, I'm so moved."
161,Rachel,"See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler."
162,Rachel,We see them every day.
163,Rachel,"And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected   to the baby."
164,Chandler,"You know, guys I got to say."
165,Chandler,This means so much   to me.
166,Chandler,That you would trust me with your child.
167,Chandler,"I mean, we all know that Monica   and I have been trying to have a baby of our own."
168,Chandler,"You know I've had my doubts   about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts   to cry>"
169,Monica,Okay!
170,Monica,It's time for dinner.
171,Monica,Everyone we're using   our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.
172,Monica,Ross starts playing with a
173,Monica,"Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will   not be well recieved."
174,Monica,<pinches Ross' arm> Ross makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt.
175,Joey,Hey!
176,Joey,How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's?
177,Joey,Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?
178,Monica,"No, honey, its."
179,Monica,thats a special plate.
180,Monica,"See   its a game, whoever gets that plate wins."
181,Joey,I can't believe I won.
182,Rachel,Monica is Ross' sister.
183,Monica,That was me.
184,Rachel,Hey.
185,Rachel,Amy.
186,Rachel,You've got to stop doing that.
187,Rachel,"<Amy gets pissed and starts cutting food on the fancy plate very harshly,   you can hear the silveware scraping the fancy plate>  Monica about to have a heart"
188,Monica,"Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets   face it you have fun."
189,Chandler,"No, if crazy plate lad.. <sees Monica frustrated   at this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?"
190,Chandler,<Ross and Rachel pause and ponder this>
191,Rachel,Well actually...
192,Chandler,Actually what?
193,Ross,well.. its just.
194,Ross,"its just in that case, then um."
195,Ross,Emma   would go to my parents.
196,Chandler,What?
197,Chandler,"So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough   to raise Emma?"
198,Chandler,Ross looks
199,Joey,Yeah he's lying.
200,Joey,He looked down.
201,Joey,<Joey looks to Phoebe and she nods in agreement>
202,Chandler,Well what is wrong with me?
203,Chandler,Am I .. am I incomptent?
204,Chandler,Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!
205,Rachel,"Honey, you're taking this the wrong way."
206,Rachel,We think   you're going to be a wonderful parent.
207,Rachel,It's just.. you're more the fun parent.
208,Ross,Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like   Monica who is more uh.
209,Ross,uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.
210,Monica,"Thats not how you see me, is it?"
211,Monica,Phoebe while cutting a sweet potatoe in the
212,Chandler,"Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do   you really think I'm not capable?"
213,Ross,"No, you both are equally capable."
214,Ross,Its just.. you're   strongest when.. when you're together.
215,Chandler,Ok.
216,Chandler,So if we both had Emma and I die <knocks   on table> she'd have to give her up.
217,Ross,"Sure, Monica would have to give her up."
218,Joey,"I lie better then that, right?"
219,Chandler,So.. let me get this straight.
220,Chandler,"So my two friends   die, I get Emma."
221,Chandler,"Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left   in my life gets taken away from me?"
222,Phoebe,There's your movie!
223,Phoebe,<claps>  Later on.
224,Phoebe,Monica opens her front door.
225,Phoebe,Chandler is sitting in the hallway.
226,Monica,Hey.
227,Monica,There you are.
228,Monica,You disappeared after dinner.
229,Chandler,Oh?
230,Chandler,Did somebody miss me?
231,Chandler,Is there a child to raise   poorly?
232,Monica,Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about.
233,Monica,I mean its not like their so responsible.
234,Monica,Emma is a product of a bottle of   Merlot and a five year old condom.
235,Chandler,Yeah but they're right.
236,Chandler,"I mean, I'm not a strong   father figure and I never will be."
237,Monica,No you learn these things.
238,Monica,You grow into it.
239,Chandler,"Yeah, but its not who I am."
240,Chandler,Everything they said   was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid.
241,Chandler,And its true.
242,Chandler,And look everybody   knows it.
243,Monica,I don't know it!
244,Monica,I want to have a kid with you because   I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard   parts.
245,Chandler,"Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying ""Go   to your room!"
246,Chandler,"You're grounded""?"
247,Monica,"Can you hear me say ""You're grounded""?"
248,Chandler,You said that to me last week.
249,Monica,How hard is it?
250,Monica,No shoes on the furniture.
251,Monica,Back to Monica and Chandler's apartment.
252,Monica,Amy is sitting on a chair by the bay window looking mad.
253,Monica,Joey groans and gets off the
254,Phoebe,It's ok.
255,Phoebe,I thought of the perfect lie for you.
256,Phoebe,It's   easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions.
257,Phoebe,You weren't at the   parade because you had a family emergency.
258,Joey,"Oh, I like that, yeah."
259,Joey,Wasn't at the parade because   I had a family emergency.

266,Monica,Oh wait.. What are you doing?
267,Joey,Setting the table.
268,Phoebe,Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy   china for dessert too.
269,Monica,Oh how nice.
270,Monica,Maybe later we can all go blow our noses   on my wedding dress.
271,Monica,Ross comes out of the guest bedroom with the diaper bag and the car seat carrying   thingy.. yeah.. thats the techinal term..
272,Monica,He goes to Chandler.
273,Ross,"Hey dude, you okay?"
274,Ross,Sorry about before.
275,Chandler,"Oh no thats okay, you're totally right."
276,Chandler,I don't   know anything about disciplining a child.
277,Chandler,"But it did hurt my feelings and I   want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey."
278,Chandler,Ross walks away with a face of yeah ok. Amy walks over to the couch and sits down next to

295,Rachel,You want to know why I'm not giving   Emily to you.
296,Ross,Emma.
297,Ross,Rachel turns to
298,Ross,Oh whose side are you on?
299,Ross,<back   to Amy> I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle   the responibility of a child.
300,Joey,ooh oooh..
301,Rachel,uh huh.
302,Rachel,Jealous of what?
303,Rachel,Of your lack of responsiblity?
304,Rachel,"You,   your immaturity?"

337,Chandler,Alright!
338,Chandler,That is it.
339,Chandler,This is our apartment and   you can not behave this way.
340,Chandler,Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't   be here at all.
341,Chandler,"Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones   I picked out, but they're very important to Monica."
342,Chandler,I want you to apologize   to her right now.
343,Rachel,"Mon, I'm so sorry."

354,Chandler,Well thanks.
355,Ross,"So, so now do I get Joey?"
356,Chandler,"Okay, but you should know he eats five times a   day and shoves pennies up his nose."

47,Rachel,"Oh, I don't know."
48,Rachel,"I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know?"
49,Rachel,"I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat."
50,Rachel,"With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat!"
51,Rachel,"And it was just this raw, animal, sexual..."
52,Ross,Wait-wait.
53,Ross,"I, I got it."

58,Ross,Yes.
59,Ross,Yes.
60,Ross,Yes!
61,Ross,"Yes, I really do!"
62,Ross,"In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who..."

73,Joey,Just so long as there's a little nudity.

95,Chandler,I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
96,Joey,I agree.
97,Joey,"I'm, like, in disbelief."
98,Chandler,"I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?"
99,Ross,"I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me."
100,Joey,She really said that?
101,Ross,"Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part..."
102,Ross,"But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight."
103,Joey,'Tonight' tonight?
104,Ross,"Well, I think it's perfect."
105,Ross,"Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey..."
106,Chandler,I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
107,Ross,"Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her."
108,Chandler,"Hey, y'know what you should do?"
109,Chandler,"You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used."
110,Rachel,"Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis."
111,Rachel,"Now, she used to be a man."
112,Rachel,"Okay, now look, see, there's Raven."
113,Rachel,We hate her.
114,Rachel,We're glad she's dying.
115,Rachel,"Okay-  Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes?"
116,Rachel,You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah.
117,Rachel,"Marcel, did you poo in the shoe?"
118,Rachel,"Marcel, bad monkey!"
119,Rachel,Oh!
120,Rachel,Oh!
121,Rachel,"Sorry, Barry."
122,Rachel,Little engagement gift.
123,Rachel,I'm sure you didn't register for that.
124,Rachel,Who died?
125,Rachel,Who died?
126,Rachel,Roll him over!
127,Rachel,"Oh, c'mon, roll him over!"
128,Rachel,Oh...!
129,Rachel,"Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel?"
130,Rachel,Because-  Marcel?
131,Rachel,Marc-
132,Joey,How could you lose him?
133,Rachel,I don't know.
134,Rachel,"We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-"
135,Monica,Wait.
136,Monica,He pooped in my shoe?
137,Monica,Which one?
138,Rachel,I don't know.
139,Rachel,The left one.
140,Monica,Which ones?
141,Rachel,Oh.
142,Rachel,"Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything."
143,Phoebe,Hey.
144,Phoebe,"Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?"
145,Chandler,Rachel lost Marcel.
146,Phoebe,"Oh no, how?"
147,Monica,He- he pooped in my shoe.
148,Phoebe,Which one?
149,Monica,Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
150,Phoebe,"No, which one?"
151,Phoebe,The right or left?
152,Phoebe,'Cause the left one is lucky...
153,Rachel,"C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?"
154,Joey,Alright alright.
155,Joey,You're a monkey.
156,Joey,You're loose in the city.
157,Joey,Where do you go?
158,Chandler,"Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things."
159,Chandler,"I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room."
160,Rachel,"Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys!"
161,Rachel,He's gonna be home any minute!
162,Rachel,He's gonna kill me!
163,Monica,"Okay, we'll start with the building."
164,Monica,"You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth."
165,Rachel,"Well, what'm I gonna do?"
166,Rachel,What'm I gonna do?
167,Monica,"Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone."
168,Monica,"Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you."
169,Rachel,Anybody wanna trade?
170,Rachel,Oh...  Mr.
171,Monica,"Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey."
172,Monica,Have you seen it?
173,Monica,Mr.
174,Monica,No!
175,Phoebe,Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?
176,Phoebe,Mr.
177,Monica,A monkey.
178,Monica,Have you seen a monkey?
179,Monica,Mr.
180,Phoebe,"Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles."
181,Phoebe,Mr.
182,Rachel,"Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face...  ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side."
183,Rachel,Okay.
184,Rachel,Thanks.
185,Ross,Hey.
186,Ross,"How did, uh, how'd it go today?"
187,Rachel,Great!
188,Rachel,It went great.
189,Rachel,Really great.
190,Rachel,"Hey, is that wine?"
191,Ross,Yeah.
192,Ross,"You, uh, you want some?"
193,Rachel,"Oh, I would love some."
194,Rachel,But y'know what?
195,Rachel,Y'know what?
196,Rachel,Let's not drink it here.
197,Rachel,I'm feeling kinda crazy.
198,Rachel,You wanna go to Newark?
199,Ross,"Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you."
200,Ross,"Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff?"
201,Ross,Well-
202,Rachel,"Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this."
203,Ross,"Okay, quick and painful."
204,Rachel,Oh God...
205,Rachel,Okay.
206,Rachel,Alright.
207,Rachel,Alright.
208,Rachel,Okay.
209,Rachel,"Ross, please don't hate me."
210,Ross,"Oh, what?"
211,Ross,What-what?
212,Rachel,Y'know Marcel?
213,Ross,...Yeah?
214,Rachel,"Well, I kind of..."
215,Rachel,I kind of lost him.
216,Rachel,Commercial Break
217,Ross,I- I- I ca- I can't believe this.
218,Ross,"I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment."
219,Rachel,"I know, I know, I'm sorry-"
220,Ross,"No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault."
221,Ross,"Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey."
222,Ross,I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
223,Rachel,"Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I-  Oh!"
224,Rachel,Who is it?
225,Rachel,See?
226,Rachel,I've even called Animal Control!
227,Ross,You called Animal Control?
228,Rachel,Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
229,Ross,Marcel is an illegal exotic animal.
230,Ross,I'm not allowed to have him in the city.
231,Ross,"If they find him, they'll take him away from me."
232,Rachel,"O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that..."
233,Ross,"That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!"
234,Rachel,"Hi, thanks for coming."
235,Rachel,"Oh, y'know what?"
236,Rachel,That was a complete misunderstanding!
237,Ross,"Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't."
238,Rachel,Turned out it was a hat.
239,Ross,Cat!
240,Rachel,Cat!
241,Rachel,What'm I saying?
242,Rachel,Cat!
243,Monica,Hi.
244,Monica,"We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel."
245,Ross,My uncle Marcel.
246,Phoebe,"Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?"
247,Phoebe,Oh my God.
248,Phoebe,You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
249,Monica,"Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?"
250,Phoebe,"Yes, but there isn't always time!"
251,Monica,Look.
252,Monica,I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this!
253,Monica,"Um, have a seat."
254,Monica,"First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller."
255,Rachel,Yeah!
256,Rachel,Luisa?
257,Rachel,Oh my God!
258,Rachel,Monica!
259,Rachel,It's Luisa!
260,Monica,The Luisa from home room!
261,Rachel,Yes!
262,Monica,"No, none at all."
263,Rachel,None.
264,Monica,"Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!"
265,Rachel,What?
266,Monica,"Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing?"
267,Monica,"Y'know, just for old times' sake?"
268,Monica,Go Bobcats?
269,Phoebe,Dun-dun-duuuur!
270,Phoebe,Sorry.
271,Chandler,Marcel?
272,Joey,Marcel?
273,Chandler,Marcel?
274,Joey,Marcel?
275,Joey,Woman No.
276,Chandler,"Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something..."
277,Joey,A monkey.
278,Chandler,Yes have you seen any?
279,Chandler,Woman No.
280,Joey,"Um, sure!"
281,Joey,"Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?"
282,Joey,Woman No.
283,Joey,Oh.
284,Joey,"Then, no."
285,Joey,Woman No.
286,Chandler,"Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono!"
287,Chandler,"Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu."
288,Joey,"Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?"
289,Chandler,"Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help!"
290,Chandler,And they're very hot.
291,Joey,"We can't, alright?"
292,Joey,We're sorry.
293,Joey,"You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey."
294,Joey,"If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out."
295,Chandler,"Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people."
296,Joey,Marcel?
297,Chandler,Marcel?
298,Phoebe,Marcel?
299,Monica,Marcel?
300,Phoebe,Marcel?
301,Phoebe,Oh-my-God!
302,Monica,Whaaat!
303,Phoebe,Something just brushed up against my right leg!
304,Monica,What is it?
305,Phoebe,"Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg."
306,Monica,"Look, Phoebe!"
307,Phoebe,Yeah!
308,Phoebe,"Oh, c'mere, Marcel!"
309,Phoebe,"Oh, Marcel, c'mere!"
310,Monica,What're you gonna do?
311,Monica,"Run, Marcel, run!"

313,Monica,Are you okay?
314,Phoebe,"Yeah, think so."
315,Phoebe,Oh!
316,Phoebe,Huh.
317,Phoebe,Whoah.
318,Monica,Oh gosh.
319,Ross,Marcel?
320,Rachel,Marcel?
321,Ross,"Marc- oh, this is ridiculous!"
322,Ross,We've been all over the neighbourhood.
323,Ross,"He's gone, he's-he's just gone."
324,Rachel,"Ross, you don't know that."
325,Ross,Oh come on.
326,Ross,"It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village."
327,Ross,And now I have a broken foot.
328,Ross,"I have no monkey, and a broken foot!"
329,Ross,Thank you very much.
330,Rachel,"Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times."
331,Rachel,What do you want me to do?
332,Rachel,You want me to break my foot too?
333,Rachel,"Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here."
334,Rachel,Ow!!
335,Rachel,Oh!
336,Rachel,"Oh my God, oh my God!"
337,Rachel,"There, are you happy now?"
338,Ross,"Yeah, yeah."
339,Ross,"Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey!"
340,Ross,I don't miss Marcel any more!
341,Rachel,"Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose."
342,Ross,"Oh, no no no."
343,Ross,"Nono, this is just vintage Rachel."
344,Ross,"I mean, things just sort of happen around you."
345,Ross,"I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings..."
346,Rachel,Ross.
347,Ross,"I don't even wanna hear it, you're just..."
348,Rachel,Ross.
349,Ross,"Oh, forget it, okay?"
350,Rachel,Ross!
351,Ross,What?
352,Ross,What?
353,Phoebe,"Oh, this is so intense."
354,Phoebe,"One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea."
355,Ross,"Hi, did you order some bananas?"
356,Ross,Mr.
357,Ross,Gimme back my monkey.
358,Ross,Mr.
359,Rachel,Then what's with all the bananas?
360,Rachel,Mr.
361,Ross,Marcel?
362,Ross,Marcel?
363,Ross,"Okay, where is he?"
364,Ross,Where is he?
365,Ross,Marcel?
366,Ross,Marcel?
367,Ross,Marcel!
368,Ross,What've you done to him?
369,Ross,Mr.
370,Ross,Are you insane?
371,Ross,"C'mere, Marcel, c'mon."
372,Ross,Mr.
373,Ross,"C'mere, Marcel."
374,Ross,Mr.
375,Ross,"Okay, gimme my monkey back."
376,Ross,Mr.
377,Ross,"Alright, I want my monkey."
378,Rachel,"Oh, c'mon, Luisa!"
379,Ross,"You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat."
380,Rachel,Alright.
381,Rachel,In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there!
382,Rachel,"But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life."
383,Rachel,"You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him."
384,Rachel,"C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here!"
385,Rachel,Take it!
386,Rachel,Alright.
387,Rachel,"Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?"
388,Ross,"It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it?"
389,Ross,Yes it will.
390,Ross,"Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine."
391,Rachel,"Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit."
392,Ross,"Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I..."
393,Rachel,"Oh, Ross, c'mon."
394,Rachel,"It's my fault, I almost lost your..."
395,Ross,"Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know?"
396,Ross,"You, you were great."
397,Ross,"...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine."
398,Ross,"You in the mood for, uh, something grape?"
399,Rachel,That'd be good.
400,Ross,Alright.
401,Ross,"The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming."
402,Ross,"Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um..."
403,Rachel,Barry?
404,Rachel,Oh!
405,Ross,We have got to start locking that door!
406,Ross,Closing Credits
407,Monica,This is me in The Sound of Music.

409,Phoebe,Nope.
410,Monica,That's because I'm in front of them.
411,Chandler,Eh.
412,Chandler,I thought that was an alp.
413,Monica,"Well, high school was not my favourite time."
414,Joey,"I dunno, I loved high school."
415,Joey,Y'know?
416,Joey,It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
417,Chandler,"Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys."
418,Chandler,Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
419,Monica,"Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?"
420,Phoebe,Oh.
421,Phoebe,Oooh!
422,Phoebe,Ooh!

3,Chandler,"Oh, well thank you in advance."
4,Rachel,"Op, but the twelfth brings a lover's spat."
5,Monica,You are going to make a joke about my special present!
6,Monica,Why would you do that?
7,Rachel,"Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself."

18,Joey,Why have I not been preparing?
19,Phoebe,No!
20,Phoebe,"Joey, you're going to be great!"
21,Joey,"But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don't know anything about technology!"
22,Joey,I can't even use Chandler's computer except to find porn!
23,Joey,And-and that's only cause it's right there when you turn it on!
24,Monica,I think our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
25,Phoebe,I'll be waiting.
26,Phoebe,Opening Credits
27,Chandler,Are you judging them by their covers?
28,Chandler,Because you're really not supposed to do that.
29,Phoebe,"No, I'm just deciding which one to useI'm gonna start writing another book!"
30,Rachel,Be-because the last one was such a big seller?
31,Phoebe,"Well, if you must know I have written 14 books."
32,Phoebe,"And as I am the only one who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received."

40,Rachel,Okay.
41,Ross,I just found out that Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.
42,Chandler,"Wait a minute, hold the phone!"
43,Chandler,You're not Elizabeth's dad?
44,Ross,"Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me."
45,Ross,It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
46,Ross,Thanks!

69,Joey,"I'm sorry, it justI don't know it doesn't really look like it can do anything."
70,Ross,It-it's great to meet you Paul.

132,Monica,What?!
133,Monica,Excuse me!
134,Phoebe,And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.

137,Rachel,Oh!
138,Rachel,Well let's look for them.
139,Rachel,Oh-oh-hey!
140,Rachel,Are these them?
141,Rachel,All right!
142,Rachel,Oh good.
143,Rachel,"Oh, wait!"
144,Rachel,"Sorry, Mr. Paul?"
145,Rachel,Mr. Paul?
146,Rachel,Paul.
147,Rachel,"Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy."
148,Rachel,You just don't look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
149,Rachel,Oh.
150,Rachel,We?
151,Rachel,Oh no!
152,Rachel,Yes!
153,Rachel,"Of course, I know that!"
154,Rachel,I justI meant y'know are you still a We' or are you just You?'
155,Rachel,Ohh.
156,Rachel,So you raised her all on your own?
157,Rachel,Ohh.
158,Rachel,Ooh!
159,Joey,Hey!
160,Chandler,Hey!
161,Phoebe,Hey!
162,Monica,How was your first day?
163,Joey,Pretty great!
164,Joey,Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
165,Chandler,"Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our faithful servants!"
166,Joey,"Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him."
167,Joey,"Yeah, he doesn't like me."
168,Joey,He had C.H.E.E.S.E.
169,Joey,knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one!
170,Joey,Ohh!
171,Phoebe,"Well, why don't you just get him fired?"
172,Joey,"I may have to, I hate to do it, but I'm the star!"
173,Joey,Y'know?
174,Joey,There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor.
175,Joey,Excuse me.
176,Joey,Joey Tribbiani.
177,Joey,Wow!
178,Joey,I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!
179,Ross,Joey?
180,Rachel,I was just getting him to like you.
181,Rachel,Commercial Break
182,Ross,Joey?!
183,Ross,Joey!
184,Rachel,"Ross, Joey is not here."
185,Ross,"Okay, I'll just wait for him in here!"
186,Rachel,"Ross, it's okay."
187,Rachel,You can come out.
188,Ross,Oh!
189,Ross,Oh my God!
190,Ross,I didn't even see you!
191,Rachel,Bye!
192,Ross,What-what-what thehow da-how did-what the-how did-what?
193,Rachel,"Well, y'know he lost his keys so he was looking for them"
194,Ross,In your mouth?
195,Rachel,No!
196,Rachel,Downstairs!
197,Rachel,"And we got to talking y'know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee."
198,Ross,You were at the coffeehouse!
199,Rachel,"Ross, what's the big deal?"
200,Rachel,So I kissed the guy!
201,Ross,"He is my girlfriend's father, okay?"
202,Ross,"It's-it's, it's weird!"
203,Rachel,WhYou dated my sister!
204,Ross,That was different!
205,Rachel,What?
206,Rachel,Why?
207,Ross,This is weird for me!
208,Rachel,"Ross look, look this is good for you."
209,Rachel,Okay?
210,Rachel,"Let's face it, so far the guy's not lovin' ya!"
211,Rachel,But I can turn that around!
212,Rachel,I got the inside track!
213,Rachel,"We can all go out to dinner, y'know?"
214,Rachel,And I can talk you up!
215,Rachel,"Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer!"
216,Ross,How is that important?
217,Rachel,Oh it's important!
218,Joey,"Apparently, there's like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there's only this one robot and this one guy who controls it!"
219,Joey,I didn't know he could get me fired!
220,Joey,What am I going to do?
221,Monica,"Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy."
222,Joey,"Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here."
223,Monica,"No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.!"
224,Monica,You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!
225,Joey,That's not a bad idea.
226,Joey,Yeah.
227,Joey,"Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys."
228,Joey,"Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs."
229,Chandler,"So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?"
230,Monica,Yeah!
231,Monica,That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
232,Chandler,"Yeah, you wish."
233,Phoebe,"""You wish."""
234,Monica,"Phoebe, stop writing about us!"
235,Phoebe,I'm not writing about you!
236,Phoebe,I'm writing about other people.
237,Chandler,Who?
238,Phoebe,Marcia and Chester.
239,Monica,Okay fine!
240,Monica,Fine!
241,Monica,"Then you know what, I'll just write about Phyllis!"
242,Monica,Hmm!
243,Chandler,Hmm.
244,Monica,Phyllis is sitting in a chair.
245,Chandler,Oh.
246,Phoebe,I see what you're doing!
247,Monica,Phyllis sees what I'm doing.
248,Chandler,Oh-oh.
249,Phoebe,"Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!"
250,Joey,Morning!
251,Joey,"Hey, how's my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?"
252,Joey,Okay!
253,Joey,All right.
254,Joey,"Umm, all right Wayne, level with me."
255,Joey,Okay?
256,Joey,I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired.
257,Joey,"Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part!"
258,Joey,"Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance!"
259,Joey,"I mean, I love-I love this little guy!"
260,Joey,Ah-ah!!
261,Joey,"Okay, that's why you didn't want me to touch him right?"
262,Joey,Here you go!
263,Joey,Okay?
264,Joey,Stupid!
265,Joey,I can't believe it!
266,Joey,God!
267,Joey,"Hey, how you doin'?"
268,Rachel,"So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me."
269,Rachel,Wow!
270,Rachel,I definitely did not see that one backfiring!
271,Rachel,I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
272,Ross,"Yeah, take your time."
273,Ross,Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior.
274,Ross,So it wasn't as bad as-as
275,Ross,Not all bad.
276,Ross,Yeah.
277,Ross,You know what?
278,Ross,I know what you mean; I do that too.
279,Ross,No!
280,Ross,No!
281,Ross,NotI don't mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl!
282,Ross,"I mean I-I have a son, who's umm six and I still think of him as a baby."
283,Ross,"Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I'm sure you are with your wife!"
284,Ross,"Oh, I'm sorry!"
285,Ross,It's unbelievable!
286,Rachel,"Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake."
287,Ross,You're back.
288,Rachel,Oh!
289,Rachel,Whoops!
290,Rachel,"I'm sorry, you were talking about Emily!"
291,Monica,"Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six."
292,Chandler,We said seven!
293,Monica,We said six!
294,Chandler,"The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six."
295,Monica,"Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would've said something like this, ""Wow!"
296,Monica,"My boyfriend's such a wise assseven!"""
297,Phoebe,Hi!
298,Chandler,Oh my good God.
299,Monica,Ugh!
300,Phoebe,I know what time you said.
301,Chandler,What?
302,Phoebe,"Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said."
303,Monica,What time?
304,Phoebe,"Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it's my book to the rescue, huh?"
305,Phoebe,"Ooh, very interesting."
306,Phoebe,"Yeah, well this certainly clears things up."
307,Chandler,What does it say?
308,Phoebe,I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
309,Chandler,Thank you for writing your book.
310,Chandler,"Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything."
311,Phoebe,Thanks!
312,Phoebe,So are you.
313,Chandler,I told you I should not wear this color.
314,Phoebe,Mon  Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night.
315,Phoebe,"Marcia thinks they're supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it's at seven."
316,Chandler,So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
317,Phoebe,That's right.
318,Monica,Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
319,Phoebe,Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
320,Joey,I can't believe I'm going to lose this job!
321,Chandler,Oh I'm so sorry man!
322,Chandler,Is there anything I can do?
323,Joey,Yeah!
324,Joey,Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
325,Joey,Yeah?
326,Joey,"Well, I don't want to talk to you Wayne!"
327,Joey,I hate you!
328,Joey,You ruined my life!
329,Joey,"Oh, Chandler, Wayne."
330,Joey,"Wayne, Chandler."
331,Chandler,"Hi, how are ya?"
332,Joey,Why should I help you?
333,Chandler,The reason he just said.
334,Joey,What do you need?
335,Joey,Yeah?
336,Joey,What are you in love with her or something?
337,Chandler,"Yeah, I've been there my friend."
338,Joey,"Oh wow Wayne, it's not really something you can teach y'know?"
339,Joey,It's pretty much something you're born with if youYou-you can teach it!
340,Joey,I'll show you right how to do it.
341,Rachel,"I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage."
342,Rachel,Now wait a minute that's not fair.
343,Rachel,"He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn't tell me."
344,Rachel,Maybe I have to pee again.
345,Ross,Y'know what?
346,Ross,I-I-I I-I have had enough of this!
347,Ross,"Y'know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect!"
348,Ross,"So if-if you've got a problem with me, frankly"
349,Ross,God no!
350,Ross,"Well if it doesn't matter to her, it doesn't matter to me!"
351,Ross,Still not yelling!
352,Ross,"That's okay, I'm not so crazy about myself right now either."
353,Ross,"Uh yeah, I guessYeah!"
354,Ross,I guess so.
355,Ross,Ohhh!
356,Ross,Kids!
357,Rachel,"Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!"
358,Ross,"That's okay Rach, we're not liking Ross right now."
359,Rachel,Oh!
360,Rachel,I've got a lot of those too!
361,Rachel,Ending Credits
362,Joey,"Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E."
363,Joey,C.H.E.E.S.E.
364,Joey,You got it!
365,Joey,"And the rabbi's beard, 100% horsehair."
366,Joey,Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.!
367,Joey,It's your line C.H.E.E.S.E.!
368,Joey,Wayne!
369,Joey,Wayne!!
370,Joey,End
0,Rachel,Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever!
1,Rachel,I think you killed us.
2,Ross,I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
3,Joey,I need something sweet.
4,Phoebe,Does anyone wanna watch TV?
5,Phoebe,Monica your remote doesn't work.
6,Monica,"Phoebe, you have to lift it and point."
7,Phoebe,Oh.
8,Phoebe,"Aw, forget it."
9,Rachel,"Yeah, you know what we should all do?"
10,Rachel,We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.
11,Joey,"Ooh-ooh, I!"
12,Joey,I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
13,Monica,That's very nice.
14,Chandler,"That's sweet, Joey."
15,Joey,"Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up."
16,Joey,Oh!
17,Joey,"Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs."
18,Joey,(Note
19,Joey,"I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering."
20,Joey,"I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material!"
21,Joey,And the way they play with your mind!
22,Joey,Is it there?
23,Joey,Is it not there?
24,Chandler,Are you aware that you're still talking?
25,Monica,Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
26,Ross,"Huh, I don't know what to pick."
27,Ross,Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction?
28,Ross,Hmm.
29,Phoebe,Wow!
30,Phoebe,"See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything."
31,Ross,I'm sorry.
32,Ross,It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
33,Chandler,No-no-no!
34,Chandler,I am the king of bad Thanksgivings.
35,Chandler,You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
36,Rachel,"Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?"
37,Ross,"Oh God, no."
38,Joey,"Oh, come on!"
39,Joey,I wanna hear it!
40,Joey,It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
41,Chandler,"It's a tradition, like the parade."
42,Chandler,"If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family."
43,Chandler,Thanksgiving 1978
44,Ross,You're right.
45,Ross,Yours is worse.
46,Ross,You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
47,Phoebe,I don't know about that.
48,Phoebe,I've got one that's worse.
49,Chandler,Really?
50,Chandler,"Worse than, ""More turkey Mr."
51,Chandler,"Chandler?"""
52,Phoebe,"Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler?"
53,Phoebe,"Yes, mine's worse!"
54,Phoebe,Thanksgiving 1862
55,Phoebe,More bandages!
56,Phoebe,More bandages!
57,Phoebe,"Please, can I get some more bandages in here!"
58,Phoebe,This man is dying Oh no.
59,Phoebe,Present Day
60,Ross,"In this life, Phoebe."
61,Phoebe,"Oh, this life!"
62,Phoebe,"Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse."
63,Joey,"Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that!"
64,Joey,I don't have any past life memories.
65,Phoebe,Of course you don't sweetie.
66,Phoebe,You're brand new.
67,Rachel,I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
68,Monica,"Oh, let's not tell this story."
69,Phoebe,"Oh no, I know!"
70,Phoebe,I know!
71,Phoebe,It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!
72,Rachel,What?!
73,Rachel,Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?
74,Joey,"Hey, it's not like it sounds."
75,Chandler,It's exactly like it sounds.
76,Chandler,Thanksgiving 1992
77,Joey,Hello?
78,Phoebe,Hello?
79,Joey,Phoebe?
80,Phoebe,Joey?
81,Phoebe,What's going on?

84,Joey,I know!
85,Joey,It's stuck!!
86,Phoebe,Easy.
87,Phoebe,Step.
88,Phoebe,How did it get on?
89,Joey,I put it on to scare Chandler!
90,Phoebe,Oh my God!
91,Phoebe,Monica's gonna totally freak out!
92,Joey,Well then help me get it off!
93,Joey,"Plus, it smells really bad in here."
94,Phoebe,"Well, of course it smells really bad."
95,Phoebe,You have your head up a dead animal.
96,Monica,Hey!
97,Phoebe,Hey!
98,Monica,"Hey, did you get the turkey bastedOh my God!"
99,Monica,Oh my God!
100,Monica,Who is that?
101,Joey,It's Joey.
102,Monica,What-what are you doing?
103,Monica,Is this supposed to be funny?
104,Phoebe,"No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary."
105,Monica,"Well, get it off now!"
106,Joey,I can't!
107,Joey,It-it's stuck!
108,Monica,"Well, I don't care!"
109,Monica,That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
110,Phoebe,"All right, hold on!"
111,Phoebe,"Okay, let's just all think."
112,Monica,"Okay, I got it."
113,Monica,Phoebe?
114,Monica,"All right, you pull."
115,Monica,I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can.
116,Monica,Joey?
117,Monica,Now is not the time!
118,Joey,Sorry!
119,Joey,Sorry.
120,Monica,"Okay, count to three."
121,Monica,1.
122,Monica,2.
123,Monica,3!
124,Chandler,Arghhhhhh!
125,Joey,It worked!
126,Joey,"I scared ya, I knew it!"
127,Joey,Ha-ha!
128,Chandler,I'm over here big guy.
129,Joey,"Yeah, you are!"
130,Joey,I scared you!
131,Joey,Present Day
132,Chandler,You did look like an idiot.
133,Joey,"Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot."
134,Joey,All right?
135,Joey,"Remember when Ross tried to say, ""Butternut squash?"""
136,Joey,"And it came out, ""Squatternut buash?"""
137,Ross,Yeah that's the same.
138,Monica,That's it.
139,Monica,That's my worse Thanksgiving.
140,Phoebe,Oh wait!
141,Phoebe,That can't be the one Rachel's talking about.
142,Phoebe,She didn't even know that happened.
143,Phoebe,So which one was it?
144,Monica,"Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story."
145,Chandler,"Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about."
146,Chandler,"Y'know, for me anyway."
147,Chandler,"And of course, the Indians."
148,Monica,"Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!"
149,Monica,Thanksgiving 1987
150,Monica,I'll get it!
151,Monica,Happy Thanksgiving!
152,Monica,Big Nosed
153,Rachel,Not for me.
154,Rachel,Chip and I broke up!
155,Rachel,Fat
156,Monica,"Oh, why?"
157,Monica,Why?
158,Monica,What happened?
159,Monica,Big Nosed
160,Rachel,"Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over Fat"
161,Monica,"Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower."
162,Monica,Big Nosed
163,Rachel,"Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?!"
164,Rachel,It really creeps me out when you call it that!
165,Rachel,"Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his tenderness."
166,Rachel,Believe me!
167,Rachel,Hi!
168,Rachel,Mr.
169,Rachel,Happy Thanksgiving!
170,Rachel,Mrs.
171,Ross,Hey!

177,Ross,"Oh, this is Monica."
178,Ross,Fat

180,Chandler,Okay.
181,Chandler,Mrs.
182,Ross,"Oh, mom."
183,Ross,Mom.
184,Ross,Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
185,Ross,Mrs.
186,Monica,"Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner."
187,Chandler,"Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in."
188,Chandler,Fat
189,Monica,dammit!
190,Ross,"So uh, Rach?"
191,Ross,"Does it, does it feel weird around here now?"
192,Ross,Y'know since I've been away at college.
193,Ross,Big Nosed
194,Rachel,Oh!
195,Rachel,"No, not really."
196,Ross,"Well, that's cool."
197,Ross,So did   Big Nosed
198,Rachel,Ugh!
199,Rachel,I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson.
200,Rachel,I am never going out with him again.
201,Rachel,I don't care how much he begs!
202,Rachel,Fat
203,Monica,I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
204,Monica,Big Nosed
205,Rachel,Y'know what?
206,Rachel,I've just had it with high school boys!
207,Rachel,They are just silly.
208,Rachel,"Silly, stupid boys!"
209,Rachel,I'm going to start dating men!
210,Ross,"Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for."
211,Ross,Fat
212,Monica,Call them mom and dad you loser!
213,Ross,Monica!
214,Ross,Fat
215,Monica,Hey Chandler!
216,Monica,Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
217,Chandler,"Oh yeah, it was great."
218,Chandler,You should be a chef.
219,Chandler,Fat
220,Monica,Okay!
221,Monica,Big Nosed
222,Rachel,Guess what?!
223,Rachel,All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!
224,Rachel,Fat
225,Monica,Oh that's so great!
226,Monica,Big Nosed
227,Rachel,I know!
228,Rachel,Fat
229,Monica,"Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything."
230,Monica,Big Nosed
231,Rachel,"Oh totally, totally."
232,Rachel,"Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know."
233,Rachel,Fat
234,Monica,"I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!"
235,Monica,Big Nosed
236,Rachel,"I know, I know."
237,Rachel,"And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!"
238,Ross,So I'm thinking about asking Rachel out tonight.
239,Ross,Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.
240,Chandler,Emotional Knapsack?
241,Ross,Yeah.
242,Chandler,Right on!
243,Chandler,Oh!
244,Chandler,"Uh, but, don't take to long okay?"
245,Chandler,"'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez."
246,Ross,"Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I'm gonna be out with her all night."
247,Chandler,"Dude, don't do that too me!"
248,Ross,"All right, it's cool you can stay here."
249,Ross,My parents won't mind.
250,Chandler,"No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister."

261,Chandler,I was an idiot back then.
262,Chandler,I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
263,Phoebe,"Oh, I can't believe you called her fat."
264,Ross,I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
265,Chandler,I am really sorry.
266,Chandler,That is so terrible.
267,Chandler,"I am so, so sorry."
268,Rachel,"Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about."

275,Chandler,We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
276,Phoebe,"Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever."
277,Phoebe,Thanksgiving 1988

291,Ross,"So uh, where's Monica?"
292,Ross,Mrs.
293,Monica,"Hi, Chandler."
294,Chandler,Oh my God!
295,Monica,What-what's the matter?
296,Monica,"Is there, is there something on my dress?"
297,Chandler,"You just, you look so different!"
298,Chandler,Terrific!
299,Chandler,That dress!
300,Chandler,That body!
301,Ross,Dude!
302,Chandler,Sorry!
303,Chandler,Mrs.
304,Ross,Oh mom!
305,Ross,"Okay, umm, her name is Carol."
306,Ross,And she's really pretty.
307,Ross,And smart.
308,Ross,"And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team."
309,Ross,Can you believe it?
310,Ross,She plays for both teams!
311,Monica,"So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner."
312,Monica,Mr.
313,Chandler,Sorry.
314,Rachel,"Oh-ho, my God!"
315,Rachel,That was so awesome!
316,Rachel,You totally got him back for calling you fat!
317,Rachel,He was just drooling all over you.
318,Rachel,That must've felt so great!
319,Monica,Well it didn't!
320,Rachel,What?
321,Monica,"Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great."
322,Monica,"Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore!"
323,Monica,"Blah, blah, blah!"
324,Monica,"Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know?"
325,Monica,I just want to humiliate him.
326,Monica,"I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!"
327,Rachel,"Okay, that we may be able to do."
328,Monica,How?
329,Rachel,Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
330,Monica,What?!
331,Monica,"I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!"
332,Rachel,"Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it."
333,Rachel,"Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him!"
334,Rachel,You're just gonna make him think that you are.
335,Monica,Yeah.
336,Rachel,Yeah.
337,Monica,And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
338,Rachel,"Then, you will definitely get him back!"
339,Monica,"Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?"
340,Rachel,"Okay, oh, here's what you do."
341,Rachel,Just act like everything around you turns you on.
342,Monica,What do you mean?
343,Rachel,"Well, like anything can be sexy."
344,Rachel,"Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel!"
345,Rachel,"Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek!"
346,Rachel,"And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it."
347,Rachel,Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.
348,Monica,I can do that!
349,Rachel,Yeah?
350,Rachel,Okay!
351,Rachel,"Good, good, because he's coming."
352,Rachel,He's coming.
353,Rachel,"Hey, what's up?"
354,Chandler,"Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year."
355,Monica,"Umm, I'd love too!"
356,Monica,"Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese."
357,Monica,I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
358,Chandler,Okay.
359,Monica,"Boy, I love carrots!"
360,Monica,Oh!
361,Monica,Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you.
362,Monica,"Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife  and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm,  my body."
363,Chandler,Are you all right?
364,Monica,"Oh yeah, of course."
365,Monica,I'm fine it's just that

384,Chandler,I need my toe!
385,Monica,"Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast!"
386,Monica,"Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!"
387,Monica,Mr.
388,Chandler,That's why I lost my toe?!
389,Chandler,Because I called you fat?
390,Monica,I didn't mean to cut it off.
391,Monica,It was an accident.
392,Chandler,That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?
393,Monica,I'm sorry!
394,Monica,It wasn't your whole toe!
395,Chandler,"Yeah, well, I miss the tip!"
396,Chandler,It's the best part.
397,Chandler,It has the nail.
398,Monica,Chandler!
399,Ross,"Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that."
400,Joey,You're a dork.
401,Chandler,I can't believe this.
402,Monica,"Chandler, I said I was sorry."
403,Chandler,"Yeah, well, sorry doesn't bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home!"
404,Chandler,I hate this stupid day!
405,Chandler,And everything about it!
406,Chandler,I'll see you later.
407,Monica,"Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do?"
408,Monica,Anything?
409,Chandler,"Yeah, just leave me alone for a while."
410,Chandler,"Oh-oh, I'm a duck!"
411,Chandler,"I go, ""Quack, quack!"""
412,Chandler,I'm happy all the time!
413,Chandler,Nice try.
414,Monica,"Wait, wait, wait!"
415,Chandler,"Look, Monica"
416,Monica,Look!
417,Chandler,This is not going to work.
418,Monica,I bet this will work!
419,Chandler,You are so great!
420,Chandler,I love you!
421,Monica,What?
422,Chandler,Nothing!
423,Chandler,"I said, I said ""You're so great"" and then I just, I just stopped talking!"
424,Monica,You said you loved me!
425,Monica,I can't believe this!
426,Chandler,No I didn't!
427,Monica,"Yes, you did!"

4,Monica,Has her water broke yet?
5,Ross,"I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug."
6,Joey,Do we have to know about that?
7,Monica,"Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?"
8,Joey,"I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars."
9,Chandler,"Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's."
10,Ross,"God, I don't believe this."
11,Ross,She could be giving birth in the cab.
12,Rachel,"Oh, Ross, relax."
13,Rachel,"It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction."
14,Rachel,"What, it's ok when Chandler does it?"
15,Chandler,You have to pick your moments.
16,Phoebe,"Did I miss it, did I miss it?"

71,Joey,Right this way.
72,Joey,All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here.
73,Phoebe,"They're tiny and chubby and so sweet to touch,     and soon they'll grow up and resent you so much."
74,Phoebe,"Now they're yelling at you and you don't know why,      you cry and you cry and you cry."
75,Phoebe,And you cry and you cry and you cry...

87,Monica,Oh yeah?
88,Monica,When?
89,Chandler,All right.
90,Chandler,I'll tell you what.
91,Chandler,"When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?"
92,Monica,Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
93,Chandler,"Oh, no, no."
94,Chandler,I just meant hypothetically.
95,Monica,"Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?"
96,Chandler,"No, no, no."
97,Monica,What is it?
98,Monica,Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
99,Chandler,"Uh, uh."
100,Monica,Well?
101,Chandler,Dear God!
102,Chandler,This parachute is a knapsack!
103,Rachel,Hey.

110,Monica,"No, I haven't seen him."
111,Rachel,"Well, where is he?"
112,Rachel,He is supposed to be here.
113,Rachel,What if the baby needs him?
114,Chandler,"Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway?"
115,Chandler,"Was, like, your father a doctor?"
116,Rachel,"Yeah, why?"

126,Joey,"Ok, look, maybe I should just go."
127,Joey,"Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?"
128,Joey,You know what the Celtics problem is?

139,Ross,"We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie."
140,Ross,What?
141,Ross,"Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie?"
142,Ross,We never landed on Jordie.
143,Ross,"We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco."
144,Ross,I got it.
145,Ross,I got it!
146,Ross,"Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps."
147,Ross,Why?
148,Ross,"No, you started it."
149,Ross,But...
150,Ross,Thanks a lot.
151,Ross,"Yeah, listen..."
152,Joey,Ew!
153,Joey,What is that?
154,Joey,Something exploded!
155,Joey,"Water breaking, what do you mean?"
156,Joey,"What's that, water breaking?"
157,Ross,Please.
158,Ross,This is so your fault.
159,Ross,"Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along."
160,Ross,You tryin' to be clever?
161,Ross,A funny lady?
162,Ross,"Oh, I'm threatened by you?"
163,Phoebe,"Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it!"
164,Phoebe,Get in here.
165,Phoebe,Come on.
166,Phoebe,"My god, you guys, I don't believe you."
167,Phoebe,There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing.
168,Phoebe,"So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!"
169,Ross,"Yeah, Susan."
170,Phoebe,"Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this."
171,Phoebe,"Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?"
172,Phoebe,Commercial Break
173,Ross,I'm having a baby in here!
174,Ross,"Ok, everyone stand back."
175,Ross,Ow.
176,Rachel,"No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?"
177,Rachel,Ok?
178,Rachel,"Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating."
179,Rachel,Dr.
180,Joey,"Come on, Lydia, you can do it."
181,Joey,Push!
182,Joey,"Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder."
183,Joey,"Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out!"
184,Joey,"Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho."
185,Joey,"Let's  I was justyeah, right."
186,Joey,Push!
187,Joey,Push!
188,Ross,Help!
189,Ross,Help!
190,Phoebe,"They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next... la la la la la la."
191,Phoebe,Susan and
192,Ross,Help!
193,Monica,"Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really."
194,Monica,"Yeah, Ross is great."
195,Monica,"He's uh, he's in a whole other place."
196,Monica,"No, he's gone."
197,Monica,"No no, you don't have to fly back, really."
198,Monica,What do you mean this might be your only chance?
199,Monica,Would you stop?
200,Monica,"I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet."
201,Chandler,Where have you been?
202,Joey,"Oh, just had a baby."
203,Chandler,Mazel tov!
204,Rachel,"No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not."
205,Rachel,Are you?
206,Rachel,Dr.
207,Rachel,"Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors."
208,Rachel,Dr.
209,Rachel,Oh.
210,Rachel,Dr.
211,Rachel,I'm a waitress.
212,Rachel,Dr.
213,Rachel,Yeah.
214,Rachel,Gotcha.
215,Rachel,Dr.
216,Rachel,Ok. That's fine.
217,Ross,"Come on, come on."
218,Ross,"Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit."
219,Ross,This is all your fault.
220,Ross,"This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know?"
221,Ross,"My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you."
222,Ross,"No no no, believe me."
223,Ross,"No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok?"
224,Ross,And you know what the funny thing is?
225,Ross,"When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok?"
226,Ross,Where does that leave me?
227,Ross,Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
228,Phoebe,This is so great.
229,Ross,You wanna explain that?
230,Phoebe,"I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one."
231,Phoebe,And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most.
232,Phoebe,And it's not even born yet.
233,Phoebe,"It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world."
234,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, you were fighting."
235,Monica,I'm sure they'll be here soon.
236,Rachel,"Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this."
237,Joey,Relax.
238,Joey,You're only at nine centimeters.
239,Joey,And the baby's at zero station.
240,Chandler,You are really frightening me.
241,Chandler,"Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart."
242,Chandler,"Uh, that's great."
243,Chandler,Anybody seen a nipple?
244,Chandler,Dr.
245,Ross,"Ok, got the vent open."
246,Phoebe,"Hi, I'm Ben."
247,Phoebe,I'm hospital worker Ben.
248,Phoebe,It's Ben... to the rescue!
249,Ross,"Ben, you ready?"
250,Ross,"All right, gimme your foot."
251,Ross,"Ok, on three, Ben."
252,Ross,"One, two, three."
253,Ross,"Ok, That's it, Ben."
254,Phoebe,"Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent."
255,Phoebe,Wait.
256,Phoebe,"Yes, it is in fact a dark vent."
257,Ross,"Phoebs, It's open!"
258,Ross,It's open!
259,Ross,We're here!
260,Ross,"Long story, honey."
261,Ross,Dr.
262,Chandler,"Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?"
263,Ross,"Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see."
264,Ross,"Oh, a head."
265,Ross,"Oh, it's, it's huge."
266,Ross,"Carol, how are you doing this?"
267,Ross,Hello!
268,Ross,"Oh, sorry."
269,Ross,"We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach."
270,Ross,"It's a boy, definitely a boy!"
271,Ross,All right!
272,Ross,"Ok, legs, knees, and feet."
273,Ross,"Oh, oh."
274,Ross,He's here.
275,Ross,He's a person.
276,Ross,"Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o."
277,Phoebe,"You guys, he's beautiful!"
278,Ross,"Oh, thanks, Pheebs!"
279,Ross,How 'bout Ben?
280,Ross,"We uh, we just cooked it up."
281,Monica,Hi.
282,Ross,Hey.
283,Monica,Can we come in?
284,Ross,"I know, I know."
285,Ross,"Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet."
286,Ross,Yeah.
287,Ross,This is Ben.
288,Ross,"Ben, this is everybody."
289,Phoebe,"Susan, he looks just like you."
290,Rachel,"Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these."
291,Chandler,"I know, I still am one of these."
292,Monica,"Ross, can I?"
293,Ross,"The head, the head."
294,Ross,You gotta...
295,Monica,"Hi, Ben."
296,Monica,Hi.
297,Monica,I'm your Aunt Monica.
298,Monica,Yes I am.

301,Monica,Closing Credits
302,Ross,"Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this."
303,Ross,"But I'll still always come back, like this."
304,Ross,"And sometimes I may be away longer, like this."
305,Ross,"But I'll still always come back, like this."
306,Chandler,"And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this."
307,Monica,He is so amazing.
308,Rachel,"Oh, I know."
309,Rachel,Look at him.
310,Joey,"Ben, Ben, hey Ben."
311,Joey,Nothing.
312,Joey,I don't think that's his name.
313,Phoebe,"Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes."
314,Phoebe,"Look, he's opening his eyes."
315,Joey,"He doesn't do much, does he?"
316,Ross,"No, this is pretty much it."
317,Rachel,You guys wanna get some coffee?
318,Ross,"All right, I'll see you guys later."
319,Phoebe,"Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again."
320,Phoebe,End
0,Rachel,Hi!
1,Monica,Hey!
2,Phoebe,Hey!
3,Rachel,So what's the final head count on my baby shower?
4,Phoebe,"About twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do."
5,Monica,Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.
6,Rachel,What?!
7,Rachel,You mean they're not coming to a social event where there's no men and there's no booze?!
8,Rachel,That's shocking!
9,Rachel,"I don't care, as long as my mom's here."
10,Monica,"Oh my God, your mother!"
11,Rachel,What?!
12,Rachel,My mom's not gonna be here?
13,Monica,"Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was."
14,Rachel,My God!
15,Monica,"Well it wasn't my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!"
16,Phoebe,"Well I don't, I don't have a mother so often I forget that other people"
17,Monica,Oh give it a rest!
18,Rachel,So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?
19,Phoebe,No.
20,Phoebe,Neither is mine.
21,Monica,"Okay, y'know what?"
22,Monica,"Don't worry, okay?"
23,Monica,We'll take care of it.
24,Monica,We'll call her.
25,Monica,Just go home and get ready.
26,Rachel,"Please, make sure she comes."
27,Rachel,"It's really important to me, I mean it's my mom!"
28,Phoebe,I know.
29,Phoebe,"I know, what's her number?"
30,Rachel,I don't know.
31,Monica,Go!
32,Monica,I have it in my book.
33,Monica,Go!
34,Monica,Wait a minute!
35,Monica,If you're in charge of the invitations why am I the one who has to call herHello Mrs. Green!
36,Monica,"Hi, it's Monica Geller."
37,Monica,Mrs.
38,Monica,"Hi, umm I know this is last minute, but we've decided to throw an impromptu baby shower for Rachel today."
39,Monica,Mrs.
40,Monica,"Yeah, I'm sorry."
41,Monica,I'm-I'm so sorry.
42,Monica,Mrs.
43,Monica,"Oh my God, my ass is sweating!"
44,Monica,Please!
45,Monica,Please!
46,Monica,Can you come?
47,Monica,It's today at four.

52,Monica,Opening Credits
53,Chandler,Hey Joe!

57,Ross,Oh cool!
58,Chandler,That's great.
59,Joey,"Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day I'll  Dr. Drake Remoray, but by night I'll be  Joey Trrrribbiani!"
60,Chandler,You'll be perfect for this!
61,Chandler,That's already your name!
62,Joey,But the audition's in a couple hours and I don't even understand the game.
63,Ross,Well do you want some help?
64,Joey,Oh really?
65,Joey,That'd be great!
66,Joey,You guys can be the contestants!
67,Ross,Awesome!
68,Chandler,"Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time."
69,Joey,All right!
70,Joey,Let's play Bamboozled!
71,Chandler,Bamboozled?
72,Joey,"Yeah, isn't that a cool name?"
73,Ross,Yeah!
74,Chandler,No!
75,Joey,All right.
76,Joey,"Uhh, okay."
77,Joey,Our first contestant is Ross Geller.
78,Joey,Why don't you tell us a little something about you Ross?
79,Ross,"Well uh, I-I'm a paleontologist."
80,Ross,"Umm, I-I live in New York."
81,Ross,I have a son Ben.
82,Ross,"Uh, hi Ben!"
83,Ross,And uh
84,Joey,I said a little bit Ross.
85,Joey,"Now, how about you Chandler?"
86,Chandler,"Well Joey, I'm a headhunter."
87,Chandler,I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations.
88,Chandler,Hi Rasputin!
89,Joey,Excellent!
90,Joey,Let's play Bamboozled!
91,Joey,"Chandler, you'll go first."
92,Joey,What is the capital of Columbia?
93,Chandler,Bogota.
94,Joey,"It's Ba-go-ta, but close enough."
95,Joey,"Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card."
96,Chandler,What does a Wicked Wango card do?
97,Joey,I should know that.
98,Joey,"Let's see, just one moment please."
99,Joey,"Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower."
100,Chandler,Higher or lower than what?
101,Joey,This is embarrassing.
102,Chandler,Can you believe how lame this is?
103,Ross,"I'm sorry, I don't believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other."
104,Phoebe,"Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five."
105,Phoebe,That's good right?
106,Monica,You ordered a stripper for the shower?!
107,Monica,That is totally inappropriate!
108,Phoebe,What?
109,Phoebe,He's gonna be dressed as a baby!
110,Phoebe,Oh hi Mrs. Green!
111,Monica,Hi!
112,Phoebe,I'm so glad you could make it.
113,Monica,"Yes, thank you so much."
114,Monica,"And again, we're so sorry."
115,Monica,We could not feel worse about it.
116,Monica,Mrs.
117,Monica,She's still mad.
118,Phoebe,Yeah I know.
119,Phoebe,Isn't it great?
120,Phoebe,One less person we have to make small talk with.
121,Monica,"Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too."
122,Monica,It-it doesn't bother you?
123,Phoebe,"No look, we've apologized twice!"
124,Phoebe,I can't do anymore than that.
125,Phoebe,I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.
126,Monica,Okay.
127,Monica,I can do that.
128,Monica,I gotta go powder my ass.
129,Monica,Mrs.
130,Rachel,Okay.
131,Rachel,Mrs.
132,Rachel,"Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I don't even have a housekeeper."
133,Rachel,Mrs.
134,Rachel,Mrs. Kay!
135,Rachel,"Oh yeah, she was sweet."
136,Rachel,She taught me Spanish.
137,Rachel,"I actually think I remember some of it, tu madre es loca."
138,Rachel,Mrs.
139,Rachel,"Well, however great she was I just can't afford that."
140,Rachel,Mrs.
141,Rachel,What?
142,Rachel,Mrs.
143,Rachel,Wh-wh-what?
144,Rachel,What?
145,Rachel,Mrs.
146,Rachel,Yes.
147,Rachel,Yes I do.
148,Joey,"All right Ross you're in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?"
149,Ross,The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey.
150,Ross,"Uh, I'll take another question."
151,Joey,"Okay, this is gonna be tough."
152,Joey,Hold your breath.
153,Ross,"It's okay, I'm ready."
154,Joey,"No dude, you gotta hold your breath until you're ready to answer the question."
155,Chandler,"This is ridiculous, he's not gonna hold his breath"
156,Joey,"Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, TrisHoly cow, that's a big word."
157,Joey,Trisc Seriously look at this thing.
158,Joey,"Chandler, how do you say that?"
159,Chandler,Let me see that.
160,Joey,This one right here.
161,Chandler,Triscadecaphobia.
162,Ross,The fear of Triscuts!
163,Joey,No!
164,Joey,"No, fear of the number 13."
165,Chandler,Fear of Triscuts?
166,Ross,"It's possible, they have really sharp edges."
167,Joey,"All right Chandler, you're up."
168,Ross,"Wait a minute, I-I believe I'm entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?"
169,Chandler,This game makes no sense!
170,Ross,Y'know what?
171,Ross,You're just upset because you're losing.
172,Chandler,"Oh come on Ross, I think we're all losers here."
173,Joey,All right.
174,Joey,"Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card."
175,Chandler,Let me think.
176,Chandler,Let me thinkOh!
177,Chandler,I don't care.
178,Joey,You-you must choose Mr. Bing.
179,Chandler,"Either, it makes no difference."
180,Joey,"Choose, you jackass!"
181,Chandler,I'll take a card.
182,Joey,"Okay, you picked the Gimmie card!"
183,Joey,You get all of Ross's points!
184,Ross,What?
185,Chandler,This game is kinda fun.
186,Ross,You don't think it's a little crazy that you get all my points just cause you
187,Chandler,I don't think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
188,Rachel,Why did you invite my mother?
189,Monica,What?
190,Rachel,She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.
191,Phoebe,For how long?
192,Rachel,Eight weeks.
193,Rachel,"I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her is taxing."
194,Monica,I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.
195,Phoebe,She can't hear you.
196,Rachel,What?
197,Rachel,"You guys, come on!"
198,Rachel,What am I going to do?
199,Phoebe,"Well, if you don't want your mother to move in with you, just tell her."
200,Rachel,You're right.
201,Rachel,You're right.
202,Rachel,"I mean I'm about to have a baby, I can tell my mother that I don't want her to just be sleeping on my couch!"
203,Rachel,Oh my God!
204,Rachel,She's gonna want to sleep in my bed with me.
205,Rachel,This cannot happen!
206,Monica,That's right.
207,Monica,"That is right, you go over there and tell her you don't want her to live with you."
208,Monica,Do not take no for an answer!
209,Rachel,Okay.
210,Monica,This is great!
211,Monica,Now she's gonna be mad at Rachel!
212,Monica,Y'know what?
213,Monica,And I'm just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had.
214,Phoebe,I have new respect for Chandler.
215,Phoebe,All right everybody!
216,Phoebe,It's time to open the presents!
217,Monica,Yes!
218,Monica,Yes!
219,Monica,"And I think that the first gift that Rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby, because you're the most important person in this room."
220,Monica,And in the world!
221,Monica,Mrs.
222,Phoebe,"How about you less important people, let's open your presents!"
223,Rachel,Mom that's okay that you didn't get you a gift!
224,Rachel,Mrs.
225,Rachel,Oh yeah.
226,Rachel,"Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own."
227,Rachel,Mrs.
228,Rachel,"But mom, I really know what I'm doing."
229,Rachel,I can handle this.
230,Rachel,Mrs.
231,Rachel,He was a hamster!
232,Rachel,I am not going to vacuum up my baby!
233,Phoebe,"Okay, come on Rach it's present time!"
234,Phoebe,Y'know you're the glue that's holding this whole party together.
235,Phoebe,It's kinda falling apart here.
236,Phoebe,Mrs.
237,Rachel,Wow!
238,Phoebe,"Okay, this is from your friend at work."
239,Rachel,Oh my gosh!
240,Rachel,Oh wow!
241,Rachel,"Oh, I know what this is!"
242,Rachel,Wait a minute.
243,Rachel,That can't be right.
244,Rachel,Is that a beer bong for a baby?
245,Rachel,Mrs.
246,Rachel,Did I say I was done guessing?
247,Rachel,"Okay, thank you for that."
248,Rachel,Oh wow!
249,Rachel,What's this?
250,Rachel,"Oh, it dispenses clean diapers!"
251,Rachel,"Well that's gross, why don't you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?"
252,Rachel,Mrs.
253,Rachel,What?!
254,Rachel,It goes ten times a day!
255,Rachel,What are we feeding this baby?!
256,Rachel,Indian food?!
257,Rachel,Mrs.
258,Monica,"Rachel, listen to your mother."
259,Monica,She is very smart.
260,Monica,Mrs.
261,Rachel,"I don't know, I'd leave it on the changing table?"
262,Rachel,What?!
263,Rachel,What'd I do?
264,Rachel,What'd I do?!
265,Rachel,Mrs.
266,Rachel,Oh comeOf course I know that.
267,Rachel,I mean of course you never leave a baby alone!
268,Rachel,"I mean who wouldshe wouldn't be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy."
269,Rachel,"Oh God, okay."
270,Rachel,Y'know what?
271,Rachel,I think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now.
272,Rachel,"So I think umm, I'm just gonna maybe open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming."
273,Rachel,"And for these beautiful gifts, and this basket is beautiful."
274,Rachel,"Okay mommy, don't ever leave me."
275,Rachel,Commercial Break
276,Joey,"In what John Houston film would you hear this line, ""Badges?"
277,Joey,"We don't need no stinkin' badges!"""
278,Chandler,Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
279,Joey,Correct!
280,Joey,There's a possible backwards bonus!
281,Chandler,Madre Sierra the of Treasure!

283,Chandler,I'd like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut please.
284,Joey,"Wise choice, how many rungs?"

286,Joey,That noise can only me one thing.
287,Chandler,Hungry monkey.
288,Ross,Hungry monkey!
289,Ross,Haaa!
290,Ross,I'd like a Wicked Wango card!
291,Joey,"Okay, it's an audio question, name this television theme song."
292,Ross,Oh.
293,Ross,Oh!
294,Ross,Oh my God!
295,Ross,"Okay, I know this, give me-give me a second!"
296,Chandler,Tell it to the Time Turtle!
297,Ross,Shut up!
298,Ross,I Dream of Genie!
299,Joey,Yes!
300,Joey,"Yes, you're back in the lead!"
301,Ross,I'd like to spin the wheel!
302,Chandler,Oh come on!
303,Joey,All right!
304,Joey,All right!
305,Joey,"Uh, umm, Super-Speedy Speed round!"
306,Ross,Is there a hopping bonus?
307,Joey,Of course!
308,Joey,Who invented bifocals?
309,Ross,Ben Franklin.
310,Joey,Correct!
311,Joey,Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest?
312,Ross,Queen Victoria.
313,Joey,Correct again!
314,Joey,"But, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no hopping bonus!"
315,Ross,Noooo!!!
316,Ross,Every time!!
317,Joey,"Now, over to Chandler."
318,Chandler,I'd like a Google Card.
319,Joey,Are you sure?
320,Chandler,Yes!
321,Chandler,No!
322,Chandler,Google!
323,Joey,Oh my God!
324,Joey,"Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, you've been Bamboozled!"
325,Chandler,Nooo!
326,Ross,Yeah!
327,Chandler,This is the best game ever!!
328,Rachel,"So umm, you're gonna stay with me as long as I need you?"
329,Rachel,Mrs.
330,Rachel,"Oh mom, I swear I'm not an idiot."
331,Rachel,"I've read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn't think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes."
332,Rachel,And-and then guess what?
333,Rachel,The baby's coming and I don't know what to do.
334,Rachel,"Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?"
335,Rachel,Mrs.
336,Rachel,Wait-wait where are you going?
337,Rachel,Where are you going?
338,Rachel,Mrs.
339,Rachel,Okay.
340,Rachel,Mrs.
341,Monica,It is going to be okay!
342,Monica,It was worth a shot.
343,Ross,Hey!
344,Phoebe,Hey!
345,Phoebe,Why are you all red and sweaty?
346,Ross,I just Bamboozled Chandler!
347,Ross,Which is not uh sexual thing.
348,Ross,That was a quick shower.
349,Phoebe,Not if you were here.
350,Ross,Wow!
351,Ross,It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
352,Rachel,"Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all."
353,Ross,A Play-Dough Barber Shop?
354,Rachel,No.
355,Rachel,She's going to live with us for eight weeks.
356,Ross,"Uh, what?"
357,Rachel,Yes!
358,Rachel,She's gonna help us take care of the baby!
359,Rachel,Woo-hoo.
360,Ross,WhatYou're not serious.
361,Ross,"I mean she's a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her."
362,Ross,She'll drive us totally crazy.
363,Ross,Mrs.
364,Ross,Hi roomie!
365,Joey,It's a pleasure to meet you Ray.
366,Joey,Rightie-O Ray!
367,Joey,"Hello, I'm Joey Tribbiani!"
368,Joey,Let's play Bamboozled!
369,Joey,"Erin, you get the first question!"
370,Joey,"In hockey, who is known as The Great One?"
371,Joey,Correct!
372,Joey,"Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?"
373,Joey,WhatWhy?
374,Joey,Well what's complicated?
375,Joey,You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance.
376,Joey,You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey; you yank his tail and boom!
377,Joey,You're in Paradise Pond!
378,Joey,Well what's fun about that?
379,Joey,You expect me to be the host of a boring game that's just people standing around answering questions?
380,Joey,Let's play Bamboozled!
381,Ross,Well wewe don't have a garage.
382,Ross,Mrs.
383,Ross,Y'know what?
384,Ross,"Maybe, Mrs. Green, it's not absolutely vital that you live with us."
385,Ross,Mrs.
386,Rachel,I do.
387,Rachel,I really do.
388,Rachel,I don't know anything.
389,Ross,I'm-I'm sure that's not true.
390,Rachel,Oh no?
391,Rachel,Pheebs?
392,Rachel,Monica?
393,Rachel,Do I know anything about babies?
394,Phoebe,"No, not a thing."
395,Monica,It's frightening.
396,Ross,"Well uh, y'know what?"
397,Ross,"Even if she doesn't know anything, I do!"
398,Ross,I have a son.
399,Ross,"And his mother and I didn't live together, and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time, by myself."
400,Ross,Mrs.
401,Ross,Yeah.
402,Ross,Mrs.
403,Ross,That's a different issue.
404,Ross,"Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I will be there toto feed her and bathe her and change her."
405,Ross,And more than that I want to do all those things.
406,Ross,Mrs.
407,Ross,Yes!
408,Ross,"Yes, you're gonna be so missed."
409,Ross,Mrs.
410,Ross,Well you're gonna be a wonderful grandma.
411,Rachel,Hello?!
412,Rachel,I still don't know what the hell I'm doing!
413,Ross,"Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way."
414,Ross,You'llyou're gonna pick it up.
415,Ross,Hey!
416,Ross,You will!
417,Ross,"Uh look, y'know when you first came to the city?"
418,Ross,You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddy's credit card.
419,Ross,Do you remember?
420,Rachel,I hope you're going somewhere with this.
421,Ross,Look at you!
422,Ross,WhatYou're-you're this big executive!
423,Ross,You are much more capable than you give yourself credit for.
424,Ross,I-I have no doubt you're gonna be an incredible mother.
425,Rachel,Really?
426,Ross,I'm telling you.
427,Rachel,Thank you.
428,Rachel,Mrs.
429,Ross,Oh.
430,Ross,Mrs.
431,Monica,You're still so funny.
432,Monica,You're so funny.
433,Monica,What do I do?
434,Phoebe,Nothing!
435,Phoebe,You have apologized to her like a million times and she's been nothing but terrible to you.
436,Phoebe,"And don't forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasn't even thanked you for it."
437,Monica,Y'know what?
438,Monica,You're-you're right.
439,Phoebe,"Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, I'd tell her off."
440,Monica,Really?
441,Phoebe,Uh-huh!
442,Monica,Okay!
443,Monica,I will!
444,Monica,Mrs. Green?
445,Monica,Mrs. Green!
446,Monica,It is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host!
447,Monica,"Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it!"
448,Monica,"Now what I did to you, it wasn't on purpose!"
449,Monica,But what you're during to me now is just plain spiteful!
450,Monica,Mrs.
451,Monica,That's right!
452,Monica,Maybe it's time you took a good hard look at a mirror young ladyold ladylady!
453,Phoebe,"Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up"
454,Monica,"So whenever you're ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you."
455,Monica,Good day!
456,Monica,I can't feel my legs!
457,Phoebe,You were fantastic!
458,Phoebe,I'm so proud of you!
459,Monica,Yeah?
460,Monica,I'm proud of me too.
461,Phoebe,You should be!
462,Monica,Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?
463,Phoebe,You got it!
464,Monica,Okay.

222,Ross,"Phoebe, you can't get out of this!"
223,Ross,Okay?
224,Ross,You have to learn how to ride a bike!
225,Phoebe,Why?
226,Phoebe,Why do I have to learn?
227,Ross,WellIn-in case of emergency.
228,Phoebe,What kind of an emergency?
229,Ross,"Well let therewhat if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, ""You ride this bike or I'll shI'll shoot you."""
230,Phoebe,"Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star."
231,Ross,"Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike andHey!"
232,Ross,I'll hold you up and-and push you.
233,Ross,Okay?

261,Ross,I-I just thought you were doing so well.
262,Phoebe,I am shocked!
263,Phoebe,Shocked!
264,Ross,It's a legitimate learning technique.
265,Ross,Wow!
266,Ross,"Hey, there's uh, some people outside, askin' about candy."
267,Monica,"Well, they're just gonna have to wait aren't they?"
268,Monica,I've only got two hands!
269,Ross,Need some help?
270,Monica,No!
271,Monica,You don't know the system!
272,Monica,There'll be nobody messing with the system!
273,Ross,"By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me."
274,Phoebe,"Oh, hello liar."
275,Ross,"Look, I-I'm really sorry I let go of the bike."
276,Phoebe,I could've been killed I hope you know!
277,Ross,I know.
278,Ross,I know.
279,Ross,"But, can we please try it again?"
280,Ross,Huh?
281,Ross,"I mean, you were so close Phoebe!"
282,Phoebe,"Well, I would love to butthe bike got stolen and the police have no suspects."
283,Ross,Phoebe.
284,Phoebe,What?!
285,Phoebe,What the hell?
286,Ross,"All right, y'know what?"
287,Ross,"If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I'm sorry, I'm just gonna have to take it back."
288,Phoebe,What?!
289,Phoebe,Why?
290,Ross,Because!
291,Ross,"Because, it-it-it's It'd be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it."
292,Ross,"Okay, this guitar wants to be played!"
293,Ross,And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don't ride it you-you're-you're killing its spirit!
294,Ross,The bike is dying.
295,Phoebe,All right.
296,Phoebe,"If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay."
297,Ross,Great!
298,Ross,Great!
299,Ross,You're making the bike very happy.
300,Phoebe,Okay Ross!
301,Phoebe,Please don't die!
302,Rachel,"Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we're gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner's office."
303,Rachel,"Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk."
304,Rachel,"Yeah, well Betty's kinda sad."
305,Rachel,Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.
306,Rachel,"Now, while I distract her, you get in the office."
307,Rachel,Let's roll!
308,Rachel,Mr.
309,Rachel,"Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anythingminute."
310,Rachel,Okay.

313,Rachel,Mr.
314,Rachel,Okay.
315,Rachel,"Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner?"
316,Rachel,Maybe some chocolates?
317,Rachel,Mr.
318,Rachel,Oh my God.
319,Rachel,Can you imagine if there was?!
320,Rachel,"I mean,  what would happen exactly."

356,Chandler,"She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name!"
357,Chandler,Am I right?
358,Chandler,The
359,Chandler,No not  Candy Lady.
360,Joey,"Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!"

297,Phoebe,Y'know?
298,Phoebe,I look down and-and I know that this isn't gonna be the most special day of my life.
299,Monica,Yeah.
300,Monica,"I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn't you start feeling silly?"
301,Phoebe,I guess.
302,Phoebe,Oh my God!
303,Monica,Oh God.
304,Phoebe,"Oh, you're such a cheater!"
305,Chandler,Hello!
306,Chandler,Little ones.
307,Monica,Hey!
308,Phoebe,Hey!
309,Monica,"So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?"
310,Chandler,Yep!
311,Chandler,And!
312,Chandler,A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me.
313,Chandler,"Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me."
314,Phoebe,"Oh, how'd that happen?"
315,Chandler,Because I'm cooler.
316,Monica,"No, seriously."
317,Chandler,"Well she's, she's the kinda girlJoey was unconscious."
318,Joey,Hey you guys!
319,Joey,What's happening?
320,Monica,Oh my God!
321,Phoebe,What is that?
322,Joey,"Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it's gonna help me not to snore."
323,Monica,"Well, are you asleep right now, Joe?"
324,Monica,Cause I don't think you have to wear it unless you are!
325,Joey,I know I don't have too!
326,Joey,It tastes good.
327,Chandler,"Plus, you look cool."
328,Rachel,"Well, I just called Joshua"
329,Phoebe,"Oh, how did it go?"
330,Rachel,"Well, I did my best to convince him that I'm not some crazy girl who is dying to get marriedI'm just going through a hard time."
331,Phoebe,What did he say?
332,Rachel,"Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding."
333,Rachel,Ugh.
334,Rachel,I feel blue.
335,Monica,"Ohh, sweetie!"
336,Monica,"Hey, I bet you anything that he's gonna call you again."
337,Rachel,"Yeah, maybe, but I don't think I even care."
338,Rachel,I don't think he's the one I'm sad about.
339,Rachel,"Y'know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don't think I'm handling it all that well."
340,Phoebe,"Yeah, maybe."
341,Rachel,And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
342,Phoebe,Any luck?
343,Rachel,"Well, yeah, y'know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again?"
344,Rachel,"I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again."
345,Monica,Again.
346,Monica,Y'know what?
347,Monica,I think we all did.
348,Ross,Hey!
349,Monica,Hey!
350,Ross,"So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay?"
351,Ross,"How about, Ernie's at 9 o'clock?"
352,Rachel,"Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three."
353,Ross,"Oh, see I-I don't know if we're gonna be hungry at three."
354,Rachel,Three people.
355,Rachel,Joshua's not gonna be there.
356,Ross,What happened?
357,Rachel,"Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me."
358,Ross,Noo.
359,Ross,Why?
360,Rachel,"Well, apparently he scares easy."
361,Ross,"Oh, Rachel, I'm-I'm sorry."
362,Rachel,It's okay.
363,Rachel,"Sometimes, things don't work out the way you'd thought they would."
364,Ross,Come here.
365,Rachel,"Oh, hey, don't you have to go pick up Emily?"
366,Ross,Yeah.
367,Rachel,Yeah.

373,Rachel,What?
374,Rachel,"Y'know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood."
375,Monica,"Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time."
376,Monica,"Maybe someday, there will be."
377,Monica,Oh God!
378,Monica,He's gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!
379,Rachel,"Oh, okay!"

8,Chandler,What's the matter honey?
9,Monica,"I don't know, my hand feels weird."
10,Monica,"I guess it's because, I'm engaged!"
11,Monica,How long before it starts getting annoying?
12,Phoebe,It starts?

14,Monica,Okay!
15,Chandler,Already?
16,Rachel,"Yeah, we got a lot to do!"
17,Rachel,"We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music"
18,Chandler,"Oh, I got some thoughts on that."
19,Rachel,"Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks"
20,Ross,"Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name."
21,Monica,Okay!
22,Chandler,What in God's name is that?
23,Ross,"Oh my God, the wedding book?!"
24,Ross,I haven't seen that since the forth grade!
25,Monica,This baby has got everything.
26,Monica,"Take y'know, locations for instance."
27,Monica,"First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage."
28,Phoebe,That is so smart!
29,Phoebe,Break it off.
30,Phoebe,Break it off now.
31,Phoebe,Opening Credits

39,Phoebe,It's about Monica and Chandler.
40,Ross,Oh my God!
41,Ross,"Of course, of course."
42,Ross,"Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment?"
43,Ross,"Umm, do you know each other's hometowns?"
44,Ross,Why don't you   Wh-what's going on?
45,Phoebe,"Well, umm, not much."
46,Phoebe,"But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y'know?"
47,Phoebe,"So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?"
48,Ross,"Umm, okay, yeah, sure."
49,Ross,But wh-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
50,Phoebe,NothingWhy?
51,Ross,"Phoebe, you said it was urgent!"
52,Phoebe,Oh yeah it is!
53,Phoebe,I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
54,Ross,Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
55,Phoebe,"Oh, I'm sorry."
56,Phoebe,I'm so rude.
57,Phoebe,Does anyone want to come to the movies?
58,Monica,"All right, so I haven't cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music."
59,Rachel,Okay.
60,Monica,"All right umm, a string quartet for the procession."
61,Rachel,Aw.
62,Monica,A jazz trio for cocktails.
63,Monica,The Bay City Rollers for dancing.
64,Monica,"Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding."
65,Chandler,"Well, you couldn't get them anyway."
66,Chandler,Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick  And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know.
67,Joey,"Hey Mon, do you have another pillow?"
68,Joey,"Y'know, something a little snugglyer?"
69,Chandler,Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
70,Joey,"Well, the duck"
71,Rachel,What?!
72,Rachel,The duck?!
73,Rachel,What the hell did the damn duck do now?
74,Joey,"Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!"
75,Chandler,"Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?"
76,Monica,Of course you can look at it!
77,Monica,"Yeah, I want your opinion too!"
78,Chandler,Okay.
79,Monica,Here you go!
80,Monica,What do you think about centerpieces?
81,Chandler,Centerpieces!
82,Monica,Yeah!
83,Monica,Roses or Lilies?
84,Chandler,Definitely roses.
85,Chandler,"Well, I just think they're a little more weddingy."
86,Chandler,But Lilies are the clear choice.
87,Monica,Oh my God!
88,Monica,It's like one mind.
89,Chandler,Uh-huh!
90,Joey,Guys!
91,Joey,Guys!!
92,Joey,You gotta let me nap!
93,Joey,"Ugh, I'm gonna get cranky!"
94,Rachel,"Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!"
95,Joey,"Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!"
96,Rachel,What?
97,Joey,"All right, I'm gonna go!"
98,Rachel,"Now Joey, what did the duck do?"
99,Joey,I don't know!
100,Joey,But he did not eat your face cream!
101,Joey,"Hey little buddy, how are you feeling?"
102,Joey,What the hell is in that face cream?
103,Joey,That's so soft.
104,Joey,Pillowcases!
105,Joey,Zelda looked at the chimney sweep.
106,Joey,"Her father, the vicar The vicar?"
107,Joey,wouldn't be home for hours.
108,Joey,Her loins were burning.
109,Joey,She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his Whoa!
110,Joey,Whoa-ho-ho-ho!
111,Joey,This is a dirty book!
112,Ross,"Uh, Phoebe"

115,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now."
116,Ross,Phoebe!
117,Phoebe,"Okay, let's talk outside."
118,Ross,"Phoebe, you can't massage people in my apartment!"
119,Phoebe,What's the big deal?
120,Phoebe,I did it at Monica and Chandler's!
121,Ross,And they knew about it?
122,Phoebe,"Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?"
123,Ross,"Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!"
124,Phoebe,"Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments."
125,Phoebe,I just don't know what the big deal is!
126,Ross,"The big deal is I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzlebeer!"
127,Ross,Cold beer.
128,Rachel,"Hey Joey, what cha doing?"
129,Joey,Sweepin'.
130,Joey,Why?
131,Joey,Turn you on?
132,Rachel,No.
133,Joey,Huh.
134,Joey,What if I was sweeping a chimney?
135,Rachel,"Joey, did you my face cream?"
136,Joey,Where are you going?
137,Joey,The vicar won't be home for hours.
138,Rachel,"Joey,  where did you learn that word?"
139,Joey,"Where do you think,  Zelda?"
140,Rachel,You found my book?
141,Joey,Yeah I did!
142,Rachel,"Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?"
143,Joey,"Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!"
144,Rachel,"Hey-hey, y'know what?"
145,Rachel,I don't care!
146,Rachel,I'm not ashamed of my book.
147,Rachel,There's nothing with a woman enjoying a littleerotica.
148,Rachel,"It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand."
149,Joey,You got porn!
150,Ross,Hello.
151,Ross,"Uh no-no, she-she's out for the night."
152,Ross,"Can I, can I help you with something?"
153,Ross,Yes I am.
154,Chandler,"Oh yeah, I should probably call them."
155,Chandler,Mr.
156,Chandler,"Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story."
157,Monica,"Oh dad, really you don't need to Mr."
158,Chandler,What a sweet story.
159,Monica,"Well, at least you're not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party."
160,Monica,Mr.
161,Monica,"Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund."
162,Monica,What?
163,Monica,Mrs.
164,Monica,What happened?
165,Monica,You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?
166,Monica,Mr.
167,Monica,I don't believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
168,Monica,Mrs.
169,Monica,You bought the beach house when I was 23!
170,Monica,Mr.
171,Monica,What about when I started dating Chandler?
172,Monica,Mrs.
173,Chandler,Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
174,Monica,I can't believe it!
175,Monica,That there is no money for my wedding?!
176,Monica,Mrs.
177,Ross,Okay!
178,Ross,"Now, I'm going to touch you."
179,Ross,"Ohh, that's soft."
180,Monica,I can't believe this.
181,Monica,Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
182,Chandler,"I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding."
183,Chandler,She's saving the rest for her divorce.
184,Chandler,And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to  Dollywood.
185,Rachel,Well what happened at dinner?
186,Monica,My parents spent the money for our wedding!
187,Phoebe,My God!
188,Phoebe,What did you order?
189,Rachel,"Wait, but there's no money!"
190,Rachel,Well this is terrible!
191,Rachel,"You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec."

195,Monica,No it's not!
196,Monica,It's not gonna be okay!
197,Monica,It sucks!
198,Monica,No swing band!
199,Monica,No lilies!
200,Rachel,"No, y'know what?"
201,Rachel,It's gonna be okay.
202,Rachel,I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast.
203,Rachel,Y'know?
204,Rachel,"And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack."
205,Chandler,"Look, it really is gonna be okay."
206,Chandler,The important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married.
207,Rachel,Do you even understand what off the rack means?
208,Phoebe,"Look, why don't you just pay for it yourself?"
209,Monica,How?
210,Monica,I don't have any money.
211,Chandler,"Well, I have some."
212,Monica,How much?
213,Chandler,"Well, close to"
214,Monica,Whoa!!!
215,Monica,Are you kidding me?
216,Rachel,Well what?!
217,Rachel,How-how much is it?
218,Monica,It's enough for wedding scenario eight.
219,Rachel,Ohh!
220,Rachel,Really?
221,Monica,"How great are you, you little saver?!"
222,Monica,"I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!"
223,Rachel,"Ohh, you guys are so made for each other."
224,Chandler,"Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?"
225,Chandler,Rachel and
226,Monica,"Ah, yeah!"
227,Chandler,"Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party."
228,Phoebe,Wow!
229,Phoebe,"Hello, Mr. Chandler."
230,Monica,This is the most special day of our lives.
231,Chandler,"No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party."
232,Monica,"Honey, umm I-I love you,  but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited."
233,Monica,Okay?
234,Monica,"Listen, we could always earn more money, okay?"
235,Monica,"But uh, we're only gonna get married once."
236,Chandler,"Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down."
237,Chandler,Okay?
238,Chandler,The answer is no.
239,Monica,You-you're gonna have to put your foot down?
240,Chandler,"Yes, I am!"
241,Phoebe,"Wow, money and a firm hand."
242,Phoebe,Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
243,Joey,Hey Rach.
244,Rachel,Joey.
245,Joey,"Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?"
246,Rachel,"Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha."
247,Joey,"No-no-no, I'm serious."
248,Joey,You don't smell it?
249,Joey,Something's on fire.
250,Rachel,"Well no, I don't smell anything."
251,Joey,"Oh, y'know what?"
252,Joey,It's probably just your burnin' loins.
253,Ross,"Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?"
254,Rachel,Nothing!
255,Ross,"Damn, this coffee's cold!"
256,Ross,"Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?"
257,Rachel,"Y'know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!"
258,Ross,So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
259,Rachel,"Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you."
260,Ross,"Oh yeah, yeah?"
261,Ross,"Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines!"
262,Ross,Sup?
263,Phoebe,Ross!
264,Phoebe,How could you do that to an old man?
265,Ross,Excuse me ladies.
266,Ross,I'm sorry?
267,Phoebe,"My massage client, Arthur?"
268,Phoebe,His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
269,Ross,I gave him an extremely professional massage!
270,Phoebe,He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
271,Ross,"Okay, so it wasn't uh, a traditional massage."
272,Ross,But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks.
273,Ross,"And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop."
274,Phoebe,"Well, he's never coming back!"
275,Phoebe,Okay?
276,Phoebe,You just cost me eight dollars a week!
277,Ross,"Hey, y'know what?"
278,Ross,This is your fault!
279,Ross,You're the one that didn't move his-his appointment.
280,Phoebe,"Oh, it's my fault?!"
281,Phoebe,You didn't have to massage him!
282,Phoebe,You could've sent him away!
283,Phoebe,You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!
284,Ross,He said he liked that!!
285,Ross,"Oh you're right, you're right."
286,Ross,I'm sorry.
287,Joey,"Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?"
288,Ross,His daughter was hot.
289,Joey,Gotcha.
290,Monica,Hey.
291,Chandler,Hey.
292,Monica,"Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding."
293,Monica,"I mean, you work, you work really hard for that."
294,Chandler,Ehh.
295,Monica,"Eh, you work for that."
296,Chandler,"Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry."
297,Chandler,I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
298,Monica,You do?
299,Chandler,"Yeah, I'm putting my foot down."
300,Chandler,"Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do."
301,Monica,"Oh, you're so sweet."
302,Monica,"Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?"
303,Chandler,"Eh, forget about the future and stuff!"
304,Chandler,"So we only have two kids, y'know?"
305,Chandler,We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
306,Monica,You thought about that?
307,Chandler,Yeah.
308,Monica,How many kids were we gonna have?
309,Chandler,"Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy."
310,Monica,What else did you think about?
311,Chandler,"Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know?"
312,Chandler,"Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff."
313,Chandler,"Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door."
314,Chandler,"Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old."
315,Monica,Y'know what?
316,Monica,"I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding."
317,Chandler,Sure you do.
318,Monica,"No, I want everything you just said."
319,Monica,I want a marriage.
320,Chandler,You sure?
321,Monica,Uh-hmm.
322,Chandler,I love you so much.
323,Monica,I love you.
324,Monica,"Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin' about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right."

106,Joey,"I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think."
107,Phoebe,"Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?"
108,Joey,You really think he'd take me?
109,Joey,"I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad."
110,Monica,"I promise you, he would definitely want you back."
111,Ross,"I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back."
112,Chandler,But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night.
113,Chandler,"I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together."
114,Ross,"Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright."
115,Ross,"And he's happy, he's, he's decorated."
116,Rachel,"Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too."
117,Chandler,But...

130,Phoebe,Oh OK.
131,Phoebe,"So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go."
132,Ross,"No, there is no way he was a velociraptor."

130,Rachel,"Three of your five, what?"
131,Ross,Celebrities I'm allowed to sleep with.
132,Rachel,Oh my God!
133,Rachel,You are giving this a lot of thought.
134,Ross,"Yeah, it's hard okay, I only have two spots left."
135,Chandler,"All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?"
136,Ross,"Okay, Elizabeth Hurely...."
137,Chandler,"Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving."
138,Ross,Susan Sarandon.
139,Chandler,"Eh, y'know what, she's to political, she probably wouldn't let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first."
140,Ross,And!!
141,Ross,Isabella Rosselini.
142,Chandler,Ooh-hoo.
143,Chandler,"Very hot, very sexy."
144,Chandler,"But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around."
145,Rachel,So?
146,Chandler,"So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time."
147,Rachel,"Yeah, cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography."
148,Phoebe,"Okay so, by melting, you meant melting."
149,Phoebe,So is it like art?
150,Phoebe,"Um, yeah sure."
151,Phoebe,Why you wanna call your Mom?
152,Phoebe,"Oh, well um, not right now."
153,Phoebe,"Y'know I'm just gonna go to bed, I think the fumes are giving me a headache."
154,Phoebe,"G'night, bro."
155,Phoebe,Here.
156,Phoebe,"Y'know, just in case."
157,Monica,What kind of karate is that?
158,Phoebe,No kind.
159,Phoebe,He just makes it up.
160,Monica,So how's it going with you guys?
161,Phoebe,"So far, it kinda blows."
162,Phoebe,"I don't know, I just thought y'know that he'd feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and...."
163,Monica,"Oh honey, we're close now but you-you wouldn't believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and.... That's where the waistband actually goes over your head."
164,Phoebe,Ah!
165,Monica,"Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game."
166,Phoebe,"Oh, how do you play the shadow game?"
167,Monica,"Oh, how do you play the shadow game?"
168,Phoebe,I just asked you.
169,Monica,I just asked you.
170,Phoebe,I don't have time for this.
171,Monica,"No, that is what the game is."
172,Phoebe,Which you just gave up really quickly.
173,Chandler,Have you seen Joey?
174,Monica,What's the matter?
175,Chandler,"Oh, just this!"
176,Chandler,"Y'know what it's my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish."
177,Joey,"Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles."
178,Chandler,What's going on?
179,Monica,He's retiling my floor.
180,Chandler,Yo!!
181,Chandler,Spackel boy!
182,Chandler,Get up!
183,Monica,"Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it."
184,Chandler,He started mine first!
185,Phoebe,"Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly."
186,Phoebe,Yeah.
187,Phoebe,Hello.
188,Phoebe,"Oh my God, I totally forgot!"
189,Phoebe,Well can't someone else do it.
190,Phoebe,"But, I have company."
191,Phoebe,"Yeah, no look, that's all right I'll come in.'"
192,Phoebe,"Um, Frank, I'm really sorry but I have to go to work."
193,Phoebe,It's-it's one of my regulars and he's insisting that I do um.
194,Phoebe,Oh!
195,Phoebe,I'm a masseuse.
196,Phoebe,I give people massages and stuff.
197,Phoebe,"Well, y'know we don't call it that, but yeah!"
198,Phoebe,All righty.
199,Phoebe,I'll be back in-in a little bit.
200,Phoebe,Unless you wanna come with me?
201,Phoebe,"No, no, you can get one yourself."
202,Phoebe,It'll be on the house!
203,Phoebe,Y'know what are big sisters for?
204,Phoebe,"No, no, no, I wouldn't do you myself, I mean that would be weird."
205,Phoebe,"Yeah, no, I'll get one of the other girls to do it."
206,Phoebe,"Oh, this will be so much fun!"
207,Phoebe,Hey!
208,Phoebe,Are you excited?
209,Monica,It's beautiful!
210,Monica,It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was.
211,Monica,Whoa!
212,Monica,Are you going in there for?
213,Chandler,"What, like a number?"
214,Ross,Hey!
215,Chandler,Hi!
216,Chandler,Bye!
217,Ross,"Okay, I'm done with my choices, these are final."
218,Rachel,"Well, it's about time."
219,Joey,"Ooh, very official."
220,Ross,"Oh, yeah, well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer."
221,Monica,And who laminated it?
222,Ross,That would be me.
223,Rachel,All right let me see.
224,Rachel,"Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel?"
225,Ross,"Hey, it's my list."
226,Rachel,"Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice."
227,Phoebe,Hey!-Hey!
228,Phoebe,What's going on?
229,Phoebe,You can't have sex with her!
230,Phoebe,"Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes."
231,Phoebe,So that's what you thought I did!!
232,Phoebe,God!
233,Phoebe,That's not what I do!
234,Phoebe,Nooo!
235,Phoebe,Why would you think that?
236,Phoebe,"Whatever, it's the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways."
237,Phoebe,You really thought it was perfect?
238,Phoebe,"Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?"
239,Phoebe,I don't....
240,Phoebe,"Right, okay, um-mm."
241,Phoebe,"Yeah, I guess I do, yeah."
242,Phoebe,"Well, I-I wasn't hopping mad, y'know."
243,Phoebe,Okay.
244,Phoebe,"All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this."
245,Phoebe,Uh-huh.
246,Phoebe,She wasn't a hooker.
247,Chandler,"Okay, on three."
248,Chandler,One....Two....
249,Joey,Why don't we just go on two.
250,Chandler,Why two?
251,Joey,Because it's faster.
252,Chandler,"Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this two' talk."
253,Rachel,Oh!
254,Joey,"All right, but in the future..."
255,Ross,Okay!!
256,Ross,Okay!
257,Rachel,Come on!
258,Ross,"Heavy thing, not getting lighter!"
259,Chandler,"Okay, one...two..."
260,Joey,So we are going on two?
261,Chandler,"Oh, good job Joe."
262,Joey,"Wow, it's big!"
263,Chandler,"Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!"
264,Joey,"Maybe, my ruler's wrong."
265,Phoebe,Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
266,Joey,Look it's not that bad.
267,Joey,"So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door."
268,Chandler,"Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea."
269,Chandler,How-how bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?
270,Joey,"Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet."
271,Rachel,"Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right."
272,Rachel,"Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right?"
273,Rachel,"Okay, great."
274,Rachel,You freak.
275,Ross,Thank you.
276,Ross,Isabella Rosselini.
277,Monica,Are you serious?
278,Monica,Oh my God.
279,Ross,Damn!
280,Ross,I can't believe I took her off my list.
281,Monica,Why?
282,Monica,Cause otherwise you'd go for it?
283,Ross,"Yeah, maybe."
284,Rachel,"Oh-oh, you lie."
285,Ross,What you don't think I'd go up to her?
286,Rachel,"Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me."
287,Ross,"Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated."
288,Rachel,"You know what honey, you go ahead, we'll call her an alternate."
289,Ross,"Okay, hold my crawler."
290,Rachel,Okay.
291,Monica,"Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?"
292,Rachel,"Honey, he's about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini."
293,Rachel,I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.
294,Ross,Hi!
295,Ross,"Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours."
296,Ross,"I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo!"
297,Ross,"Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee?"
298,Ross,Or maybe reimburse you for that one?
299,Ross,"Well, yeah, kinda."
300,Ross,"Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people,  so I'm allowed to sleep with you."
301,Ross,"No, no, no, it's flattery."
302,Ross,"Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella."
303,Ross,"Don't, don't just dismiss this so fast."
304,Ross,I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
305,Ross,"Um, yeah."
306,Ross,"Um, no."
307,Ross,"But, okay."
308,Ross,"Um, see, but that's not the final draft."
309,Ross,"Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local."
310,Ross,What?
311,Ross,We're just gonna be friends.
312,Ross,Closing Credits
313,Joey,Y'know what?
314,Chandler,Umm?
315,Joey,I bet ya ya I could fit in there.
316,Chandler,I've got five bucks says you can't.
317,Joey,"Get out your checkbook, mister."
318,Chandler,"Oh, I think I have the cash."
319,Joey,You are dogged man!
320,Joey,I totally fit!
321,Chandler,"Yeah, you got me."
322,Chandler,I'm out five big ones!
323,Chandler,Here you go.
324,Joey,Thank you.
325,Joey,Cha-ching!
326,Joey,"Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln."
327,Joey,Better luck next time buddy.
328,Joey,And the drinks are on me!
329,Joey,End
0,Chandler,"Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays?"
1,Chandler,I remember when people used to use big lights.
2,Rachel,"That's a good story, Grandpa."
3,Ross,Hey
4,Ross,"Wow, Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree!"
5,Ross,Did someone get her drunk again or?
6,Monica,Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about.
7,Monica,It's about being with the people that you love.
8,Phoebe,That is nice and we're done.
9,Phoebe,TADA!
10,Chandler,"I dunno what it is, it just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me."
11,Monica,"Oh, here."
12,Chandler,See now it feels like Christmas!
13,Chandler,Opening Credits
14,Ross,and that's the story of the dreidle.
15,Ross,"Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life's triumph over death."
16,Ross,And that was like 4000 years ago.
17,Rachel,"So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story."
18,Joey,Hey you guys.
19,Chandler,Hey Joe what's up?
20,Joey,I had to get out of the apartment.
21,Joey,Janine is like stretching all over the place.
22,Joey,"Y'know, everywhere I look she's like"
23,Chandler,I can see why that's hard to resist.
24,Joey,I like her so much!
25,Monica,"Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way."
26,Joey,I know.
27,Joey,And she's so sweet.
28,Joey,I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
29,Chandler,"You are aware that she's not a monkey, right?"
30,Ross,I am so over Janine.
31,Ross,"I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she's like OLD NEWS!"
32,Ross,Hi Janine!
33,Monica,Hold it!
34,Monica,Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve?
35,Monica,Oh my God!
36,Monica,We love that show!
37,Monica,I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
38,Chandler,"Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you?"
39,Ross,You're gonna be a party person!
40,Ross,Those guys rock the most!
41,Joey,Totally!
42,Joey,I would love to spend New Year's with you.
43,Ross,"Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time."
44,Ross,"Yeah, not a lot of people know that."
45,Ross,Are you serious?
46,Monica,We are there!
47,Chandler,"What, what are you laughing at?"
48,Rachel,"Well, I used to date him, but you're still going out with her!"
49,Ross,Bye Janine!
50,Joey,Did she just ask me out on a date?
51,Chandler,I don't think so.
52,Monica,What are you talking about?
53,Monica,She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
54,Rachel,"Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross."
55,Rachel,"Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing."
56,Joey,Oh.
57,Joey,Maybe.
58,Joey,But hey I know how I can find out.
59,Joey,"We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right?"
60,Joey,"So at midnight, I can kiss her."
61,Joey,"And if she kisses me back, great!"
62,Joey,Y'know?
63,Joey,"But if she says Dude, what the hell are you doing?'"
64,Joey,"I can say It wasn't me, it was New Years!'"
65,Rachel,"Well, that's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick."
66,Ross,It was a dry day.
67,Monica,We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve!
68,Ross,Oh my God!
69,Monica,Oh my God!
70,Chandler,Oh my God!
71,Joey,"OK, listen I've been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright?"
72,Joey,"It's a show, but we're just dancing, OK?"
73,Joey,It's no big deal.
74,Joey,The important thing to remember  stay cool.
75,Ross,Got it!
76,Ross,Oh my God it's just like I dreamed it!
77,Ross,Scuse us
78,Ross,"Yeah, I have a question."
79,Ross,When is this gonna air?
80,Joey,Ross!
81,Joey,So when is it gonna air?
82,Rachel,"Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet."
83,Chandler,"I can save you time ladies, I'm right here."
84,Phoebe,"Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk?"
85,Phoebe,This doesn't concern you.
86,Rachel,We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
87,Chandler,What?
88,Chandler,That's terrible!
89,Phoebe,"No-no, we do it every year!"
90,Chandler,"Oh well, that makes it not terrible."
91,Phoebe,"No, yeah, we never find them!"
92,Phoebe,She's always best at us that wily minx.
93,Rachel,"Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, them we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?"
94,Chandler,"No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!"
95,Phoebe,But we have to!
96,Chandler,"No, you don't have to, and you can't because I live here too."
97,Phoebe,"Well then, you should look with us."
98,Chandler,Why?
99,Rachel,"Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?"
100,Chandler,"No, I have a great idea for a present for her."
101,Phoebe,"Oh, that's it?"
102,Phoebe,A great idea!
103,Rachel,"Chandler, that's not enough."
104,Rachel,"I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents?"
105,Rachel,And you've just gotten her one great present?
106,Rachel,I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad.
107,Rachel,Why would you do that to her Chandler?
108,Rachel,Why?
109,Rachel,Why?
110,Chandler,"If I help, we can find em faster!"
111,Rachel,That's right!
112,Phoebe,"Ooh ooh, we have a live one!"
113,Rachel,"Oh, it's a Macy's bag!"
114,Phoebe,"Ooh, who's it for?"
115,Rachel,"Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch?"
116,Rachel,P.S.
117,Rachel,"Chandler, I knew they'd break you."
118,Phoebe,Uh-oh.
119,Phoebe,She may be onto us.
120,Rachel,We are so gonna find them this year.
121,Chandler,"Y'know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don't, you don't do that every year do you?"
122,Rachel,Yeah.
123,Chandler,"You don't, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?"
124,Chandler,Phoebe and
125,Rachel,"No, we never do that"
126,Chandler,Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life!
127,Chandler,"Okay, that did not just happen!"
128,Monica,"Okay, here comes another camera."
129,Ross,Right.
130,Ross,No biggie.
131,Ross,Stay loose.
132,Ross,Why do they keep doing that?
133,Monica,"If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms."
134,Monica,They've been taping those people up there all day.
135,Ross,Right.
136,Ross,"Hey, what'd you guys do to get up on there?"
137,Monica,Oh yeah?
138,Monica,Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
139,Ross,Yeah!
140,Joey,Really?
141,Joey,What do you mean?
142,Joey,Uh-huh.
143,Joey,No-no-no-no-no we came together!
144,Joey,"No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot."
145,Chandler,"I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!"
146,Rachel,"Yeah, we found them."
147,Rachel,There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
148,Phoebe,"Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!"
149,Chandler,"Those are my gifts, I got them for you."
150,Phoebe,Ohhh.
151,Phoebe,Thanks Chandler they're great!
152,Rachel,"Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?"
153,Chandler,Those are book ends!
154,Chandler,That's a great gift!
155,Phoebe,"Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz."
156,Rachel,Ha!
157,Chandler,"Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?"
158,Rachel,"Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!"
159,Joey,Hey-hey dancer girl!
160,Joey,Can I go to the bathroom?
161,Joey,I just..
162,Joey,Here we go.
163,Joey,Looking good Gellers!
164,Ross,We know!
165,Monica,"Hey, see that snippy guy over there?"
166,Monica,He's the one who decides who gets up on the platform.
167,Monica,We should go dance by him.
168,Ross,Okay.
169,Monica,"Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren't wearing underpants?"
170,Ross,Monica!
171,Ross,Would it?
172,Joey,Hey!
173,Joey,Tall guy!
174,Joey,"Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you're dancing with."
175,Joey,Tall
176,Joey,"Yeah, yeah, okay."
177,Joey,"Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown  I'm trying to win her over, so I was wondering if.."
178,Joey,Tall
179,Joey,"Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, mellow!"
180,Joey,Tall
181,Joey,"Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know Tall"
182,Joey,"Alright, alright, hey y'know fair is fair,  if you're right, you're right, what can I say, but hey oh no!"
183,Joey,Tall
184,Joey,"Hey, now you're the one who wet his pants."
185,Monica,"Man, this sucks!"
186,Monica,"Y'know if Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who's gonna be the losers then?"
187,Ross,"Hey, I know what'll get us up on a platform!"
188,Monica,What?
189,Ross,The routine!
190,Monica,"Ross, we haven't done the routine since middle school."
191,Ross,"Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he'll wanna build us our own platform!"
192,Monica,Was it really that good?
193,Ross,We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category!
194,Ross,"Look, it's almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?"
195,Monica,"Okay, let's do it."
196,Monica,Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
197,Monica,5 6 7 8!
198,Ross,"So, do we really have to ask who's going up on the platform next?"
199,Monica,Yes!
200,Joey,"Uh, take a look at the guy's pants!"
201,Joey,"I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don't you think he went a little overboard?"
202,Joey,"Yeah, take a hike wetpants!"
203,Ross,Can you believe this?
204,Ross,We're gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!
205,Monica,I know!
206,Monica,"Hey, you haven't been practising the routine, have you?"
207,Ross,No!
208,Monica,Me too!
209,Ross,"Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y'know?"
210,Monica,"Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don't wanna look stupid!"
211,Joey,No!
212,Joey,Year!
213,Joey,Happy No Year!
214,Phoebe,Hey!
215,Phoebe,Look who I found!
216,Chandler,"Oh, hey guys!"
217,Phoebe,"Y'know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden."
218,Chandler,"Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter."
219,Phoebe,Or we could just follow your clever jokes  any ideas?
220,Phoebe,No!
221,Phoebe,Didn't think so!
222,Phoebe,"Okay, c'mon guys, show us where the presents are!"
223,Chandler,"Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage!"
224,Chandler,"Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage?"
225,Phoebe,"Hmm, how about my azzz?"
226,Rachel,"Hey, this is hollow."
227,Phoebe,What?
228,Rachel,"This bench, it's hollow!"
229,Rachel,I can't believe I never knew that!
230,Rachel,"Oh, the presents!!"
231,Phoebe,"No, don't look directly at them!"
232,Chandler,What?
233,Phoebe,"Alright, no, we could look at them!"
234,Rachel,"Oh, this one's for me!"
235,Phoebe,"Oh, this one's for Chandler."
236,Phoebe,Here.
237,Chandler,Oh great!
238,Phoebe,And the big one's for me!
239,Rachel,"Ooh, let's open them!"
240,Chandler,Okay!
241,Chandler,Okay!
242,Chandler,Okay!
243,Phoebe,Hee hee!
244,Chandler,"Wait, we can't do this."
245,Chandler,Phoebe and
246,Rachel,Why?
247,Chandler,I don't wanna know what Monica got me.
248,Chandler,Y'know?
249,Chandler,"I mean, look, I'm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about."
250,Rachel,"Whatever Linus, I'm opening mine."
251,Chandler,Nobody is opening anything ok?
252,Chandler,"Look, I don't know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica's face when I give her my present, and I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine."
253,Chandler,"So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?"
254,Phoebe,Will you get us better gifts?
255,Chandler,Fine!
256,Monica,Hey guys!
257,Monica,You found the presents?
258,Monica,"Chandler, you let them find the presents?"
259,Monica,Great!
260,Monica,Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
261,Chandler,That's what you got me?
262,Phoebe,"Oh yes, I see what you mean."
263,Phoebe,That look is priceless.
264,Joey,"Home sweet home, huh?"
265,Joey,"Nice to, uh, get back to reality."
266,Joey,Plus we know how the New Year's gonna go off.
267,Joey,"I guess there's no reason for all that Y2K panic, y'know?"
268,Joey,"Anyway, g'night!"
269,Joey,Yeah?
270,Joey,"Oh, yoii."
271,Joey,What was that for?
272,Joey,Really?
273,Joey,"In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too."
274,Joey,In the moment.
275,Joey,But only in the moment.
276,Joey,So do ya wanna kiss again?
277,Joey,No.
278,Joey,"3, 2,"
279,Joey,"Uh, yeah, okay."
280,Joey,Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
281,Joey,Ending Credits
282,Monica,"We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled CUT!'"
283,Rachel,"Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?"
284,Monica,Yeah.
285,Monica,But of course we had to update it a little bit.
286,Monica,"Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!"
287,Rachel,Cos I was gonna say there's no way you could've done the end the way you guys did it back then!
288,Monica,What?
289,Monica,We could do it!
290,Ross,"I don't know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then."
291,Monica,"I can do it, okay?"
292,Monica,"Come on, let's go."
293,Monica,Monica and
294,Ross,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8"
295,Monica,I can't do it!
296,Chandler,"Now you do that, you're on TV."
297,Chandler,End
0,Monica,"Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such   a turn-on.You wanna...?"
1,Chandler,"You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired."
2,Monica,I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
3,Chandler,You're on!
4,Phoebe,Hey!
5,Monica,What's up?
6,Phoebe,"Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the   way there's  no law against."
7,Phoebe,"And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you   want..."
8,Ross,... finally...
9,Phoebe,Is that Ross?
10,Monica,"Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid   walls."
11,Phoebe,Sounds like he's with someone.
12,Chandler,He could be alone.
13,Chandler,"This morning I heard him do   push-ups, and then talk to his triceps."
14,Monica,"Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right."
15,Monica,You know I   hear someone else in there with him.
16,Ross,"God, you're amazing..."
17,Ross,I didn't even have to ask you   to call me that.
18,Monica,"Oh my God, that's Charlie!"
19,Chandler,She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
20,Phoebe,Oh that tart... floozy... giant...
21,Monica,I'm not sure about this.
22,Phoebe,"Yeah, you're right."
23,Phoebe,This is none of our business.
24,Monica,No I'm not sure that it's  the best way to hear   everything.
25,Monica,Someone get me a glass!
26,Phoebe,"Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay?"
27,Phoebe,I'm not gonna eavesdrop   on my friend.
28,Rachel,Ooh...
29,Rachel,I love Barbados!
30,Joey,Ooh...
31,Joey,I can't believe I'm kissing you.
32,Joey,I'm     kissing Rachel!
33,Rachel,"I know, I'm her!"
34,Phoebe,Rachel and Joey!
35,Phoebe,It's Rachel and Joey!!
36,Monica,What?
37,Phoebe,Get over here!
38,Rachel,ooh...
39,Chandler,Wow!
40,Monica,"Oh my God,   I love how thin these walls are!"
41,Monica,Thank you.
42,Monica,OPENING CREDITS
43,Rachel,"Hey, you know, before you said     that nothing could happen between us?"
44,Rachel,What changed?
45,Joey,"Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know."
46,Joey,Then   I saw him kissing Charlie...
47,Rachel,What?
48,Rachel,Ross and Charlie?
49,Rachel,Wow!
50,Rachel,"She's really   making her way through the group, huh?"
51,Rachel,"Ah, who am I to talk?"
52,Monica,I can't believe this.
53,Monica,Rachel and Joey?
54,Chandler,How about the dinosaur twins in the other room?
55,Chandler,No-one is manning that wall!
56,Monica,I'm on it!
57,Chandler,Anything?
58,Monica,I think I hear curtains closing...
59,Phoebe,We've got shoes being kicked off over here.
60,Monica,"Bedsprings, unmistakable!"
61,Chandler,You do realise  that's your brother?
62,Monica,Not until you said it.
63,Monica,Somebody switch!
64,Monica,"Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey   and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike!"
65,Monica,We're the only people  leaving with the   same person we came with.
66,Chandler,That's not true.
67,Chandler,I came with Monica and I'm leaving   with Weird Al.
68,Monica,"Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes."
69,Monica,"Tomorrow morning,   before we leave, I'm going to the salon."
70,Chandler,Okay Buckwheat!
71,Phoebe,"You gotta hear this, it's great..."
72,Phoebe,It's like free   porn!
73,Ross,Weh...*sigh*
74,Ross,"Yeah, It's just..."
75,Ross,I don't think I can do this...
76,Ross,"No, NO!"
77,Ross,"Look, I need to talk to Joey."
78,Ross,"I mean, you guys just broke up."
79,Ross,"Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it."
80,Ross,"Alright, I'm gonna go find them..."
81,Ross,I just need a... need a before I can... you know.
82,Ross,Grandma... grandma... grandma...
83,Ross,"Okay, I see you later."
84,Phoebe,That's the door.
85,Phoebe,He's gone...
86,Chandler,And she's... turning on the TV... and watching...   Miss Congeniality!
87,Monica,"Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it   too well!"
88,Ross,"Hey, what are you guys doing?"
89,Phoebe,"Oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying   goodbye to the hotel."
90,Phoebe,"I love you... Paradise Hotel, Golf resort   and Spa..."
91,Monica,"Yeah, we had a great time, thank   you!"
92,Chandler,Bye!
93,Ross,"Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?"
94,Chandler,He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend   Charlie.
95,Chandler,That's the situation as we know it...
96,Ross,"Well, if you see him could you please tell   him I'm looking for him?"
97,Chandler,You got it!
98,Ross,Thanks!
99,Ross,Thank you!
100,Monica,"Other wall, people!"
101,Monica,Other wall!
102,Ross,"Rach,  you there?"
103,Joey,"Oh my God, it's Ross."
104,Joey,What are we gonna do?
105,Rachel,"Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm."
106,Rachel,Just be calm.
107,Rachel,For all he   knows we're just hanging out together.
108,Rachel,Right?
109,Rachel,Just be nonchalant.
110,Rachel,That's not nonchalant!
111,Joey,No idea what it means.
112,Rachel,"Oh... okay, just hide!"
113,Ross,Rach?
114,Rachel,Coming!
115,Rachel,"Try under the bed, try under the bed!"
116,Rachel,There's no room under the bed.
117,Ross,Is everything okay?
118,Rachel,Yeah...
119,Ross,Hey.
120,Rachel,Hi...
121,Ross,You know where Joey is?
122,Rachel,...I really don't...
123,Ross,Can I talk to you for a minute?
124,Rachel,"Yeah, sure..."
125,Joey,I don't believe this... Have you guys been...
126,Phoebe,Shhh...
127,Phoebe,This is the listening side of the   wall.
128,Ross,"And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up,   and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me."
129,Rachel,Uh-huh... right... yeah...
130,Ross,And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the   day I met her.
131,Rachel,"Oh, I know..."
132,Rachel,I know it's been   really hard for you.
133,Ross,"Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before   you know it, we were kissing."
134,Ross,"I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna   be?"
135,Rachel,"That is hard to say,   Ross."
136,Rachel,That is hard to say.
137,Ross,"You know, I gotta go find him."
138,Ross,He's gotta be here someplace.
139,Rachel,You would think!
140,Rachel,Joey!
141,Joey,Is he gone?
142,Rachel,How are you doing this?
143,Joey,Pssst...
144,Rachel,How... wha... Hey!
145,Rachel,What are you... What is this?
146,Rachel,Have you guys been listening this entire time?
147,Rachel,"Monica, Chandler and"
148,Phoebe,YE-AH!
149,Phoebe,"Now, what is this?"
150,Rachel,"Ah, what is this?"
151,Rachel,"Well, lets see, we kissed for ten   minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth   grade!"
152,Phoebe,Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated   this could get?
153,Phoebe,What about Ross?
154,Joey,"Well, he's with Charlie now."
155,Monica,"Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything   really happens with her."
156,Monica,"And as his friend, I mean, don't you think   he deserves the same from you?"
157,Joey,"You're a pain in   my ass, Geller!"
158,Rachel,"All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all   the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it..."
159,Chandler,"Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you   do one thing for us?"
160,Chandler,The people that  care about you?
161,Rachel,Sure...
162,Chandler,Enunciate!
163,Rachel,Get out!
164,Rachel,Are they right?
165,Joey,"Probably, yeah..."
166,Joey,"I mean, maybe we should... hold off   until we talk to Ross."
167,Rachel,"Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have   to do anything tonight."
168,Joey,"Yeah, I think that'd be best..."
169,Joey,"So, so I'm gonna..."
170,Joey,I'm gonna take off...
171,Rachel,Although...
172,Joey,I like although!
173,Rachel,"I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like...   six years..."
174,Joey,Six years?
175,Joey,Wow...
176,Joey,It's almost as long as highschool...
177,Rachel,"Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now."
178,Joey,Absolutely!
179,Joey,He's not thinking about you.
180,Rachel,No...
181,Joey,I'm thinking about you...
182,Rachel,Yeah...
183,Joey,Let's forget about Ross...
184,Rachel,Forgotten.
185,Joey,What's wrong?
186,Rachel,"Nothing... Joey's voice, but she sees"
187,Ross,Seriously... What is it?
188,Rachel,Nothing...
189,Rachel,It's really...
190,Rachel,"It's nothing... Come here,   come here...  Joey's voice/Ross"
191,Rachel,"Sorry, I just uhm..."
192,Rachel,I can't seem to get Ross out   of my head...
193,Joey,"Well, maybe I can help."
194,Joey,Rachel/Ross
195,Joey,Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...
196,Ross,Hey!
197,Chandler,Hey!
198,Ross,You guys ready to go?
199,Chandler,Not quite.
200,Chandler,"Monica's still at the salon, and I'm   just finishing packing."
201,Ross,Dude!
202,Ross,You're not taking your Bible?
203,Chandler,You're not supposed to take that.
204,Chandler,"Besides, it's   a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?"
205,Ross,Learn about Jesus...
206,Ross,Hey!
207,Ross,"Uh, no... no."
208,Ross,I couldn't find him.
209,Ross,I'm just gonna talk   to him on the plane.
210,Ross,Stop it!
211,Ross,You're filthy!
212,Phoebe,"Hey, have you guys seen Monica?"
213,Ross,"Uh, actually I think she went to the salon."
214,Phoebe,"Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright..."
215,Monica,Check it out!
216,Phoebe,Who's day just got better?
217,Phoebe,CHANDLER!
218,Chandler,Hey!...
219,Chandler,aaaaaahhhh!
220,Monica,What do you think?
221,Chandler,I think....
222,Chandler,I think I can see your scalp.
223,Monica,Don't you just love it?
224,Ross,Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.
225,Ross,"You've never said that in your life, have you?"
226,Ross,I thought so.
227,Monica,And listen to this...
228,Chandler,What d'ya know...
229,Chandler,It's a treat for the eyes and the   ears.
230,Joey,"Whoo, whoo."
231,Joey,"Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting   next to Charlie after we broke up."
232,Chandler,"Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care   about your social life."
233,Joey,"Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?"
234,Ross,"Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference   with Charlie."
235,Joey,I understand...
236,Ross,"No, I'll do it."
237,Chandler,Wish I could switch with someone.
238,Chandler,I really don't   wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.
239,Phoebe,"Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain   turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin..."
240,Phoebe,Aaah... you're not good at this...
241,Phoebe,"No, I think I can come over."
242,Phoebe,"It's Saturday, right?"
243,Phoebe,What?
244,Phoebe,Why not?
245,Phoebe,You have a... You have a date?
246,Phoebe,With who?
247,Phoebe,You have...  have a girlfriend?
248,Phoebe,For how long?
249,Phoebe,Three months?
250,Phoebe,Okay...
251,Phoebe,"This is probably none of my   business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?"
252,Phoebe,"Oh, okay... good."
253,Phoebe,You do that.
254,Phoebe,"And then when you   get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you."
255,Phoebe,"You know what, we're gonna have sex."
256,Phoebe,Let's just leave   it there.
257,Ross,"Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey."
258,Ross,I think this is the   right time.
259,Ross,"He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says ""duty   free""."
260,Rachel,Ross is coming over.
261,Rachel,I think now would be a really   good time to talk to him.
262,Joey,I guess so.
263,Joey,I'm just... really nervous.
264,Rachel,"Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done,   they'll probably be serving dinner."
265,Joey,Ooh...
266,Rachel,Still nervous?
267,Joey,I'm gonna get the lasagna.
268,Ross,Hey Rach...
269,Rachel,Yeah!
270,Ross,Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.
271,Rachel,"Yeah, yeah sure!"
272,Rachel,Yeah!
273,Ross,Hey!
274,Joey,Hey!
275,Ross,"So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie."
276,Joey,Yeah?
277,Ross,"Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry   to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and...,   well..."
278,Joey,You kissed.
279,Ross,Wha...  What?
280,Ross,What would give you that idea?
281,Joey,I saw you.
282,Ross,"Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else   happened, okay."
283,Joey,"Ross, Ross, Ross..."
284,Joey,It's okay.
285,Ross,What?
286,Joey,It's okay.
287,Joey,"You know, I totally understand,   alright?"
288,Joey,"You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know."
289,Joey,And...
290,Joey,I want you to be happy.
291,Ross,Are you serious?
292,Joey,Yeah... Now I have something...
293,Ross,I am speachless...
294,Ross,I mean the fact that you would put   my happiness first like that.
295,Ross,"I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know   that?"
296,Joey,Oh... uh...  look... before you...
297,Ross,"No, I mean it."
298,Ross,"You are so loyal man, and selfless,   and generous..."
299,Joey,"I am those things, yeah."
300,Ross,You know what?
301,Ross,"I know Chandler longer, so I always   think of him as my best friend, but now..."
302,Ross,I may have to rethink some   stuff...
303,Joey,Dude!
304,Ross,"Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you..."
305,Joey,I can't think of anything.
306,Ross,Thanks!
307,Joey,Yeah.
308,Rachel,So hi!
309,Ross,Hi!
310,Rachel,"So you eh, you talked to Joey?"
311,Ross,"Ah, yeah."
312,Ross,We had a really good talk.
313,Rachel,Oh!
314,Rachel,That's great!
315,Ross,Yeah!
316,Rachel,"Oh, so everything's okay?"
317,Ross,"Oh, no, it's great."
318,Ross,It's great.
319,Ross,He is...
320,Ross,He is an amazing   guy.
321,Rachel,"Ah... Well, obviously I think so too."
322,Ross,"Well, I'm so excited about this."
323,Rachel,Really?
324,Rachel,Excited?
325,Ross,Are you kidding?
326,Ross,I have had some very dirty dreams   about this...
327,Rachel,Excuse me!
328,Rachel,"You didn't tell him, did you?"
329,Joey,I couldn't.
330,Joey,He was saying all these really nice things   about me.
331,Joey,I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back.
332,Joey,I'm on a edge   on Chandler.
333,Rachel,Oh God!
334,Rachel,"Alright, fine."
335,Rachel,"You know what Joey, forget   it."
336,Rachel,"When we go back to New York, I will tell him."
337,Joey,Thank you.
338,Joey,"Yeah, I appreciate that."
339,Joey,COMMERCIAL BREAK
340,Phoebe,"Hi, Mike's place."
341,Phoebe,"Ooh, that was fast."
342,Phoebe,"Yeah, you can't do that!"
343,Phoebe,"Oh, come on Mike, strap   on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together."
344,Phoebe,"You know,   women appreciate honesty."
345,Phoebe,We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while.
346,Phoebe,Just F.Y.I.
347,Phoebe,Her name is Precious?
348,Phoebe,Is she a purebreed or did you   pick her up at the pound?
349,Phoebe,"Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch   her tummy and give her a liver snout."
350,Phoebe,I...
351,Phoebe,I'm Phoebe.
352,Phoebe,Enchanté
353,Monica,"Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these...    Ow!"
354,Chandler,"You go back to work tomorrow night, right?"
355,Monica,Yeah!
356,Chandler,"So if you want people to see them, then by definition   you're not  having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?"
357,Monica,"Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be   able to do this."
358,Monica,"You like that, right?"
359,Chandler,What are you singing?
360,Monica,"It's ""Bolero"" from ""10""."
361,Chandler,"It's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" from ""Apocalypse   Now""...   See, here's the"
362,Monica,You what?
363,Monica,You said you liked them.
364,Chandler,Did I?
365,Chandler,Let's refresh.
366,Chandler,I believe what I said was   that I could see your scalp.
367,Monica,"Fine, so you don't like them."
368,Monica,Everybody else does.
369,Chandler,"Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel   said, was  she had never notice the shape of your skull before."
370,Chandler,"And Joey...   Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different."
371,Monica,You know what?
372,Monica,I don't care.
373,Monica,"I like it like this,   and I'm gonna keep it."
374,Monica,You're just jealous because your hair can't do this...    OUCH!
375,Chandler,Hit yourself in the tooth?
376,Monica,And the eye!
377,Ross,Hi...
378,Ross,There she is.
379,Ross,Hi Emma.
380,Ross,"Oh my God, I missed   you."
381,Ross,"Oh Emma, I missed you so much."
382,Ross,Hey... Did you have   a good time with grandma Green?
383,Ross,Huh?
384,Ross,Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants   again to use as a rattle?
385,Rachel,"That was one time, Ross, and they were only like   5 milligrams."
386,Ross,"Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay?"
387,Ross,Okay?
388,Ross,I want you to wait right here.
389,Ross,Come here sweetie.
390,Rachel,"Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really   need to talk to you about."
391,Ross,"Okay, shoot!"
392,Rachel,"Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal."
393,Ross,OH NO!
394,Rachel,What?
395,Rachel,What is it?
396,Ross,"Oh, major shampoo explosion!"
397,Rachel,"Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy."
398,Ross,"Oh, it's all over everything."
399,Ross,Why?
400,Ross,Why me?
401,Rachel,Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
402,Ross,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
403,Ross,You were saying?
404,Rachel,"Well, yeah..."
405,Rachel,"Okay, look it's about me and..."
406,Ross,"Oh, not another one!"
407,Ross,Oh my G... And this is moisturiser.
408,Ross,It's even harder to clean!
409,Ross,Why?
410,Ross,Why do bad things happen to good people?
411,Rachel,Wow!
412,Rachel,"Well, clearly this is not a good time."
413,Ross,"Duh, you think?"
414,Phoebe,"Okay, bye."
415,Phoebe,"Alright, so Mike's on his way over."
416,Phoebe,"See,   you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at   the restaurant, so you know..."
417,Phoebe,Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong.
418,Phoebe,Point is...
419,Phoebe,I'm gonna take off.
420,Phoebe,"Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?"
421,Phoebe,"Yeah, I can't say that."
422,Phoebe,"uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be   straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately   that effectively ends your relationship with him."
423,Phoebe,And he's very sorry about   that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.
424,Phoebe,"Well, I don't..."
425,Phoebe,"Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you."
426,Phoebe,"Damn it woman, pull yourself together!"
427,Phoebe,"Have     some pride, for the love of God."
428,Phoebe,"Okay, not a fan of the tough love."
429,Phoebe,"But he didn't really know, you know."
430,Phoebe,He wasn't planning   on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...
431,Phoebe,"Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this."
432,Phoebe,"You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a   wang."
433,Phoebe,"I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you..."
434,Phoebe,He was gonna   break-up with you on your birthday?
435,Phoebe,"And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell,   but he cheated on you a lot this weekend."
436,Phoebe,You're welcome!
437,Chandler,"Honey, you've been in there for a long time...   Is everything okay?"
438,Monica,Not really.
439,Monica,I have a problem.
440,Chandler,Really?
441,Chandler,What happened?
442,Monica,"Well, I was dancing around, and singing ""No Woman,   No Cry"" and I got stuck."
443,Chandler,You can't move at all?
444,Monica,"Oh, well, I can move..."
445,Chandler,"If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?"
446,Monica,I guess so...
447,Chandler,Some of these look a little   frayed.
448,Monica,"Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free."
449,Joey,Hey!
450,Rachel,Hi!
451,Joey,"So, did you err... did you tell Ross?"
452,Rachel,"Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related   emergency."
453,Rachel,So I guess now it's your turn again.
454,Joey,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no..."
455,Joey,"I think it's better   if you tell him, you know."
456,Joey,It's easier for a woman.
457,Joey,"That way, you know, if   he gets mad, all you have to do is go..."
458,Joey,I didn't mean it.
459,Joey,I'm so so--ooory.
460,Rachel,"Yeah, 'cause that's what we do."
461,Joey,"Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how   about this?"
462,Joey,Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.
463,Rachel,"Okay, that sounds fair."
464,Rachel,It just means that once again   we can't...
465,Joey,"I know, I know..., but that's okay."
466,Joey,"I mean, we can   control ourselves, we're not animals."
467,Rachel,No!
468,Rachel,Of course we can wait.
469,Rachel,"Alright, so I guess that   means good night then?"
470,Joey,Yeah!
471,Joey,Good night!
472,Rachel,Goo--ood night!
473,Joey,Good night!
474,Rachel,"Seriously, good night!"
475,Joey,Stop saying good night.
476,Rachel,Okay.
477,Rachel,COMMERCIAL BREAK
478,Monica,Look what I found in the drawer...  And you said I'd never wear this...
479,Chandler,"Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a   little something for me?"
480,Monica,"Sure, what do you have in mind?"
481,Chandler,I think you know.
482,Monica,Really?
483,Monica,I don't really feel like it.
484,Chandler,This is what I want to do.
485,Monica,"Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much."
486,Chandler,"She's an   FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant."
487,Chandler,THE END
0,Monica,Hi.
1,Monica,Six?
2,Monica,I just had it for one night.
3,Monica,It's three.
4,Monica,"Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power."
5,Monica,"Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, cause I only have three."
6,Monica,Oh my God.
7,Monica,Richard?
8,Monica,Hi!
9,Monica,Wow!
10,Monica,Your lip went bald.
11,Monica,"Hey, thanks."
12,Monica,Right.
13,Monica,What?
14,Monica,"That's because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it's static cling."
15,Monica,Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity.
16,Monica,It's good to see you too.
17,Monica,Opening Credits
18,Monica,You see that guy?
19,Monica,"He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn."
20,Monica,Yeah.
21,Monica,Me too.
22,Monica,"Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea."
23,Monica,"No, I just I think that it's too soon."
24,Chandler,"Yeah, baby!"
25,Ross,What are you doing?
26,Chandler,Making chocolate milk.
27,Chandler,Do you want some?
28,Ross,No thanks.
29,Ross,I'm 29.
30,Rachel,"Oh my God, I gotta go to work!"
31,Ross,"Oh sweetie, when do you think you're going to get off tonight?"
32,Rachel,Oh I don't know honey.
33,Rachel,It's gonna be really late.
34,Ross,"Oh come on, not again."
35,Rachel,I know.
36,Rachel,I'm sorry.
37,Rachel,"Look, I'll make a deal with you all right?"
38,Rachel,Okay?
39,Ross,Hmm.
40,Rachel,For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work...
41,Ross,Yeah.
42,Rachel,I will wake you up in a way that's proved very popular in the past.
43,Ross,"Now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that."
44,Rachel,Right.
45,Phoebe,Hi.
46,Joey,Look at you.
47,Joey,Since when do you roller blade?
48,Phoebe,Oh!
49,Phoebe,Since tomorrow.
50,Phoebe,"I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that's he's going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff."
51,Ross,And what are you going to do for him?
52,Phoebe,I'm going to let him.
53,Ross,Okay.
54,Joey,Cool.
55,Monica,Morning.
56,Rachel,Somebody got in late last night.
57,Monica,"Yeah well, I ran into Richard."
58,Rachel,When did this happen?
59,Monica,"Oh, um, around"
60,Phoebe,"Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger."
61,Ross,"So, are you gonna see him again?"
62,Monica,Tomorrow night.
63,Rachel,"Monica, what are you doing?"
64,Chandler,"Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him."
65,Monica,"It's not a date, okay."
66,Monica,I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
67,Joey,"Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you'll probably be hungry after the sex."
68,Monica,We're not gonna have sex!
69,Monica,"Okay, nothing's changed here."
70,Monica,"He still doesn't want children and I still do, so that's why we're just gonna be friends."
71,Ross,Naked friends.
72,Rachel,Hey.
73,Joey,Hey.
74,Rachel,Do you have any ice?
75,Joey,Check the freezer.
76,Joey,"If there's none in there, then we're probably out."
77,Joey,Are you just getting in from work?
78,Joey,It's late.
79,Rachel,"Yeah, I know."
80,Rachel,"I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien."
81,Rachel,"I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it."
82,Rachel,How was your day?
83,Joey,I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
84,Rachel,Hmm.
85,Rachel,"Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?"
86,Joey,"Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so."
87,Rachel,"But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?"
88,Joey,"Well, safer."
89,Joey,"Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know."
90,Rachel,How often do you read it?
91,Joey,Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
92,Rachel,"Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once."
93,Rachel,"But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining?"
94,Joey,"The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The Shining."
95,Joey,Okay?
96,Joey,And the answer would
97,Rachel,Okay.
98,Rachel,"Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay."
99,Rachel,"I will read The Shining,  and you will read Little Women."
100,Joey,"All right, you got it."
101,Rachel,All right.
102,Joey,Okay.
103,Rachel,Okay.
104,Joey,"Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women."
105,Rachel,Yeah.
106,Joey,How little are they?
107,Joey,"I mean, are they like scary little?"
108,Phoebe,"Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert."
109,Chandler,"Oh, hey."
110,Ross,Hey.
111,Phoebe,You've have lipstick right here .
112,Phoebe,"That's okay, it's mine, we just kissed."
113,Ross,Oh.
114,Chandler,"So ah, isn't a bit cold out for shorts?"
115,Chandler,"Right, right."
116,Chandler,Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
117,Chandler,I'm up!
118,Chandler,"I'm up, I've gotten up now!"
119,Chandler,"Anybody ah, want anything?"
120,Phoebe,I'll have coffee.
121,Ross,"Yeah, make that three."
122,Chandler,"Okay Ross, why don't you come with me?"
123,Ross,Okay.
124,Ross,"What ah, what is the matter with you?"
125,Ross,What's going on?
126,Chandler,Robert's coming out.
127,Ross,"What, what do you mean, what?"
128,Ross,Is he gay?
129,Chandler,No.
130,Chandler,He.....he's coming out of his shorts.
131,Ross,What?
132,Chandler,The man is showing brain.
133,Ross,Are you sure?
134,Ross,(Chandler
135,Ross,Okay.
136,Ross,"No, no, that won't be ah, that won't be necessary"
137,Chandler,Wellll?
138,Ross,"Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
139,Chandler,What do we do?
140,Chandler,What do we do?
141,Ross,"Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it."
142,Chandler,Like an eclipse.
143,Monica,"You say Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty."
144,Monica,"Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes."
145,Monica,You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
146,Monica,Oops.
147,Monica,Gotta keep squishing.
148,Monica,Okay.
149,Monica,"Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt."
150,Monica,"Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it  and it should umm, be....."
151,Monica,"Umm, you've got some on your pants."
152,Joey,These little women.
153,Joey,Wow!
154,Chandler,"Your liking it, huh?"
155,Joey,Oh yeah!
156,Joey,Amy just burned Jo's manuscript.
157,Joey,I don't see how he could ever forgive her.
158,Ross,"Umm, Jo's a girl, it's short for Josephine."
159,Joey,But Jo's got a crush on Laurie.
160,Joey,Oh.
161,Joey,You mean it's like a girl-girl thing?
162,Joey,Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.
163,Chandler,"No, actually Laurie's a boy."
164,Joey,No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
165,Phoebe,Hey!
166,Chandler,Hey.
167,Ross,Hey!
168,Ross,"How'd the ah, basketball go?"
169,Phoebe,"Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer."
170,Chandler,You mean a three pointer?
171,Phoebe,"Oh, I get more because I'm dainty."
172,Phoebe,"Yeah, in the back."
173,Phoebe,You want a quarter?
174,Joey,What are you doing?
175,Joey,Get back over on your side of the...
176,Joey,Hello!!
177,Joey,"Hi, I'm Joey, we haven't met."
178,Phoebe,What?
179,Phoebe,What?
180,Phoebe,"You guys, what is going on?"
181,Phoebe,You not like Robert?
182,Phoebe,Why are you laughing?
183,Ross,Calm down.
184,Ross,There's no reason to get testy.
185,Phoebe,You guys!!
186,Phoebe,Come on!
187,Chandler,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped."
188,Phoebe,What do you mean?
189,Phoebe,Hey.
190,Joey,"Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?"
191,Monica,"So, how'd the lasagne go over?"
192,Monica,Really?!
193,Monica,Good.
194,Monica,So you owe me three pretty things.
195,Monica,"Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too."
196,Monica,I know.
197,Monica,It's hard this whole platonic thing.
198,Monica,It's a word!
199,Monica,"Yeah, I do think it's better this way."
200,Monica,"Yeah, we're being smart."
201,Monica,"Yes, I'm sure."
202,Monica,I'll call you back.
203,Monica,Commercial Break
204,Monica,So we can be friends who sleep together.
205,Monica,Sounds smart and healthy to me.
206,Monica,"So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?"
207,Monica,Oh.
208,Monica,No!
209,Monica,No!
210,Monica,"Cause if you do that means you'd be cancelling it for me, and we're just friends."
211,Phoebe,Hey.
212,Phoebe,Ooh!
213,Phoebe,Don't sit down!
214,Phoebe,Yeah.
215,Phoebe,"And, first here's a gift."
216,Chandler,Stretchy pants!
217,Chandler,"Why, those are the greatest things in the world!"
218,Chandler,"If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!"
219,Phoebe,"That's all right, that's well, I figured...."
220,Joey,Hey!
221,Joey,How's it going?
222,Ross,Good.
223,Joey,"Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?"
224,Rachel,"Oh, Danny just went into room 217."
225,Joey,"Oooh, the next part's the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub..."
226,Rachel,"Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it!"
227,Joey,All right I'll talk in code.
228,Joey,Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
229,Chandler,"Hmmm, that's very cool."
230,Joey,"Oh, all blank, and no blank, make's blank a blank blank."
231,Joey,"Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away."
232,Joey,Aww!
233,Rachel,Joey!
234,Rachel,I can't believe you just did that!
235,Chandler,I can't believe she cracked your code!
236,Rachel,"All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she's still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy."
237,Joey,Hey!
238,Joey,Mine was by accident!
239,Joey,"All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad."
240,Rachel,Eh.
241,Rachel,Beth dies.
242,Joey,"Beth, Beth dies?"
243,Rachel,Um-hmm.
244,Joey,Is that true?
245,Joey,If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
246,Chandler,"No, Beth doesn't die, she doesn't die."
247,Chandler,Does she Rachel?
248,Rachel,What?
249,Ross,Joey's asking if you've just ruined the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson?
250,Rachel,No.
251,Rachel,She doesn't die.
252,Joey,Then why would you say that?
253,Rachel,"Because, I wanted to hurt you."
254,Rachel,Oh my....
255,Monica,Hi.
256,Rachel,Sorry.
257,Rachel,I'm sorry.
258,Monica,You would not believe my day!
259,Monica,"I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs,  in a grill fire."
260,Monica,What are you smiling at?
261,Rachel,"I'm sorry, I was just thinking you're day could still pick up."
262,Monica,"Yeah, right."
263,Monica,I love this friend thing!
264,Phoebe,"Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?"
265,Ross,Oh.
266,Phoebe,"Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like Is it on the lose?'"
267,Phoebe,Is it watching me?'
268,Chandler,"We can't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff."
269,Ross,"He's right, even if it's to say something complementary."
270,Phoebe,Hey.
271,Phoebe,"No, I can spot you from here."
272,Phoebe,"Okay, listen Robert..."
273,Ross,"Hey, don't we have to..."
274,Chandler,"Yeah, we got, um-hmm."
275,Phoebe,"Umm, I think you're really, really great..."
276,Phoebe,"I-I-I-I-I don't know, I don't know what to say."
277,Monica,Ow!
278,Monica,Oh my God!
279,Monica,Oh my God!
280,Monica,"So um, who was she?"
281,Monica,Did you like her?
282,Monica,"And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this."
283,Monica,"Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not."
284,Monica,"I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom....  Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people?"
285,Monica,Why not?!
286,Monica,I mean this has been the most amazing week.
287,Monica,Would it be so terrible?
288,Monica,Even if we were friends who lived together.
289,Monica,"Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever."
290,Monica,"That's not true, you don't have a moustache."
291,Monica,"Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do."
292,Monica,I don't think I could do it again.
293,Monica,How bout one last game of racquetball?
294,Monica,Watch the thorns!
295,Rachel,What?
296,Joey,"Beth is really, really sick."
297,Rachel,Awwww.
298,Joey,"Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she could do."
299,Rachel,Joey?
300,Joey,Yeah.
301,Rachel,Do you want to put the book in the freezer?
302,Joey,Okay.
303,Rachel,Okay.
304,Rachel,End
0,Chandler,Okay!
1,Chandler,"Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent."
2,Joey,Right!
3,Joey,And when is that due?
4,Chandler,First of the month.
5,Joey,And that's every month?
6,Chandler,"No, just the months you actually want to live here."
7,Joey,Ahhh.
8,Chandler,"Okay, here is the phone bill."
9,Joey,Oh my God!
10,Chandler,That's our phone number.
11,Chandler,"Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don't I justwhy don't I just cover you for a while?"
12,Joey,No-no!
13,Joey,No way!
14,Joey,Joey Tribbiani does not take charityanymore.
15,Chandler,"It's not charity, Joe"
16,Joey,No!
17,Joey,Forget it!
18,Joey,"OkayI mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you."
19,Joey,"All right, I can take of myself."
20,Joey,"Now, what's next?"
21,Joey,Come on.
22,Chandler,"Okay uh, here's the electric bill."
23,Joey,This is how much we pay for electric?!!
24,Chandler,"Uh, yeah."
25,Chandler,"So, we'll do the rest of the bills later then?"
26,Chandler,Opening Credits
27,Phoebe,So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
28,Chandler,"No, I hope not!"
29,Chandler,"I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it."
30,Phoebe,"Well, how much do you think he needs?"
31,Chandler,"I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know?"
32,Chandler,But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride.
33,Phoebe,Why don't you hire him as an actor?
34,Phoebe,You could have him dress up and put on little skits.
35,Phoebe,Whatever you want.
36,Chandler,Well that would help the pride thing.
37,Monica,Hey!
38,Chandler,Hey!
39,Chandler,Wow!
40,Chandler,You look great!
41,Chandler,Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
42,Monica,Okay.
43,Chandler,Okay!
44,Chandler,"So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?"
45,Monica,"Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we'd go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe."
46,Phoebe,"And also, my birthday."
47,Monica,It's not your birthday.
48,Phoebe,What a mean thing to say!
49,Phoebe,I would never tell you it's not your birthday!
50,Joey,Hey!
51,Ross,Hey!
52,Chandler,Hey!
53,Phoebe,Hey!
54,Phoebe,So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
55,Chandler,"Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing."
56,Ross,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight."
57,Ross,I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
58,Joey,"I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist."
59,Ross,I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
60,Rachel,"Pheebs, I was wondering"
61,Monica,You're not dressed yet?!
62,Monica,We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
63,Rachel,Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
64,Monica,"Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed."
65,Rachel,Of course I packed!
66,Rachel,Monica relax!
67,Rachel,I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.
68,Phoebe,"My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this place."
69,Phoebe,Oh my God!
70,Phoebe,Monica's just gonna kill you.
71,Rachel,"Yeah, yeah, I know."
72,Phoebe,"Well, what you're wearing is fine for that."
73,Monica,"Rachel, I need to borrowYou're not packed!!!!"
74,Monica,You're not packed even a little bit!
75,Rachel,Surprise!
76,Monica,What?
77,Rachel,"No, no don't get mad because lookthis is what happened."
78,Rachel,"So I-I started packing, then I realized, ""What am I doing?"
79,Rachel,"I am lousy at packing!"""
80,Rachel,Right?
81,Rachel,But you love packing!
82,Rachel,"So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!"
83,Monica,I'll be coordinator!
84,Monica,Oh my God!
85,Monica,"I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything!"
86,Monica,"Okay, look everybody has to help!"
87,Monica,Okay?
88,Monica,"You can help, can't you Phoebe?"
89,Phoebe,I have plans.
90,Monica,You're plans were with us.
91,Phoebe,That's right.
92,Monica,"All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things."
93,Monica,"Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!"
94,Phoebe,Okay.
95,Monica,Okay!
96,Monica,"Oh my God, thank you!"
97,Phoebe,Hurry!
98,Phoebe,Monica's gonna make you pack!
99,Phoebe,She's got jobs for everyone!
100,Phoebe,"Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves!"
101,Monica,Okay!
102,Monica,The movers will be here in 11 hours.
103,Monica,Rachel has not packed.
104,Monica,"Now, everybody has to help!"
105,Monica,"Chandler, we're gonna start with"
106,Chandler,"Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey."
107,Monica,I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
108,Chandler,"Yes, but for the last time."
109,Monica,"Okay fine, now Ross"
110,Ross,"Oh, but-but I can't do it."
111,Monica,Why not?
112,Joey,I've got Ben.
113,Ross,"Because, because I've got Ben."
114,Monica,"It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime."
115,Monica,Where-where is he?
116,Chandler,He's at a dinner party.
117,Monica,Is he really coming?
118,Monica,Because I can see right into your apartment!
119,Ross,Of course he is!
120,Ross,"What, do you think I'd just use my son as-as an excuse?"
121,Ross,What kind of father do you think I am?
122,Monica,"All right, sorry."
123,Ross,I gotta go make a fake Ben.
124,Joey,Here it is!
125,Joey,Our last pizzas together as roommates.
126,Chandler,"Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese."
127,Joey,Oh that's okay.
128,Joey,"Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice."
129,Joey,"Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!"
130,Chandler,"Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night."
131,Chandler,"What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?"
132,Joey,"What, are you crazy?"
133,Joey,You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued '97 season.
134,Joey,It would be easier if you just give me your money.
135,Chandler,Yes it would.
136,Chandler,What do you say to $50?
137,Joey,"Okay, you're on."
138,Chandler,"Okay, let's play!"
139,Chandler,"The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently."
140,Rachel,"Ohhhhhh, look it's the roller blades."
141,Monica,Oh God!
142,Rachel,You remember when we got these?
143,Monica,No.
144,Rachel,I guess you weren't there.
145,Phoebe,"You guys, we said we were gonna have fun!"
146,Phoebe,"Come on, hey, remember the time  You don't remember?"
147,Rachel,"I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving."
148,Monica,I'm gonna miss you so much.
149,Phoebe,"Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though."
150,Phoebe,Y'know?
151,Phoebe,"Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you're gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you're not gonna miss."
152,Monica,I don't think there's anything.
153,Phoebe,"Come on, there's gotta be something."
154,Monica,"Nope, she's perfect."
155,Rachel,I have one.
156,Phoebe,Good!
157,Phoebe,Great!
158,Phoebe,You can go first.
159,Rachel,"Uh well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact that you're never allowed to move the phone pen."
160,Phoebe,Good that's a good one.
161,Phoebe,"Okay, Monica, anything?"
162,Phoebe,Y'know?
163,Phoebe,Does Rachel move the phone pen?
164,Monica,"Aw, sometimes."
165,Monica,"Always, actually."
166,Phoebe,"Okay, good."
167,Phoebe,There you go.
168,Phoebe,Doesn't anyone feel better?
169,Monica,Not just the phone pen.
170,Monica,I never get my messages.
171,Rachel,You get your messages!
172,Monica,"Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch."
173,Rachel,"So-so, you missed a message from who?"
174,Rachel,Chandler or your mom?
175,Rachel,Or Chandler?
176,Rachel,Or your mom?
177,Phoebe,Great!
178,Phoebe,It worked!
179,Phoebe,No one's sad.
180,Joey,Yes!
181,Joey,I win again!
182,Joey,Ha-ha!
183,Joey,That's like 500 bucks you owe me!
184,Joey,Whoo-ho-hoo!
185,Joey,$500 that is a loooot of electricity!
186,Joey,Whoo-ho-ho!
187,Joey,I gotta buy some food.
188,Chandler,"Okay, give me a chance to win my money back."
189,Chandler,Okay?
190,Chandler,"Sudden death, one goal, $1,000."
191,Joey,You serious?
192,Chandler,Oh yes!
193,Joey,"Okay, get ready to owe me!"
194,Chandler,Okay.
195,Joey,"Okay, here we go."
196,Joey,Ready?
197,Chandler,No!
198,Chandler,No!
199,Chandler,No!
200,Chandler,Noone can beat me.
201,Chandler,See?
202,Chandler,"Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking."
203,Monica,Hello?
204,Monica,"Oh, hi Ross!"
205,Monica,See?
206,Monica,Other people call me!
207,Rachel,"Ooh, your brother."
208,Rachel,Score!
209,Monica,What's up?
210,Ross,"Oh, I'm just over here with Ben."
211,Ross,I thought we'd say hi.
212,Monica,"Oh, put him on!"
213,Ross,"Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica."
214,Ross,"Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now."
215,Ross,He's smiling though!
216,Ross,"Okay, talk to you later."
217,Phoebe,"Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad."
218,Phoebe,"Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?"
219,Rachel,You know what else I'm not gonna miss?
220,Rachel,"""I'm Monica."
221,Rachel,I wash the toilet 17 times a day.
222,Rachel,"Even if people are on it!"""
223,Monica,"""Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight?"
224,Monica,No?
225,Monica,"Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"""
226,Rachel,"""I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people."
227,Rachel,"Ever!"""
228,Phoebe,Hey!
229,Phoebe,I call her!
230,Monica,"""Oh my God, I love Ross!"
231,Monica,I hate Ross!
232,Monica,I love Ross!
233,Monica,"I hate Ross!"""
234,Rachel,"""Oh my God, I can't find a boyfriend!"
235,Rachel,"So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"""
236,Phoebe,"Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations."
237,Phoebe,Commercial Break
238,Chandler,Still broken?
239,Joey,This sucks man!
240,Joey,"The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500."
241,Chandler,"Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?"
242,Joey,"Nah, not my game."
243,Chandler,"Okay, uh, how about, how abouty'know what?"
244,Chandler,We could play a new game.
245,Chandler,"A new game, it's fun."
246,Joey,"Well, what's it called?"
247,Chandler,Cups.
248,Joey,I don't know how to play Cups.
249,Chandler,I'll teach ya!
250,Chandler,"Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun."
251,Joey,All right.
252,Chandler,"Okay, here you go."
253,Chandler,"I have two queens, what do you have?"
254,Joey,A two and a five.
255,Chandler,"Ho-ho, you win!"
256,Chandler,50 dollars!
257,Joey,Really?
258,Chandler,Oh yeah!
259,Chandler,"Okay, let's play again."
260,Chandler,What do you got?
261,Joey,A four and a nine.
262,Chandler,You're kidding right?
263,Joey,No.
264,Joey,Why?
265,Chandler,Well that's a full cup!
266,Joey,Damn!
267,Joey,I am good at Cups!
268,Monica,I'm not talking to her!
269,Phoebe,"Well, one of you has to take the first step!"
270,Phoebe,"And it should be you, because she's the one who's leaving."
271,Phoebe,It's harder for her!
272,Monica,"Well, maybe you're rightShe made fun of my phone pen!"
273,Phoebe,"I know, I took it hard too."
274,Monica,"Listen Rachel, I feel really bad aboutWhat are you doing?"
275,Rachel,I'm unpacking!
276,Monica,What?
277,Rachel,I'm not moving!
278,Rachel,Is that picture straight?
279,Monica,It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
280,Rachel,"Hey, y'know what?"
281,Rachel,You're the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler!
282,Rachel,You should be the one to go!
283,Rachel,Why should I have to leave?
284,Monica,Because it's my apartment!
285,Rachel,Well it's mine too!
286,Rachel,What else you got?
287,Monica,"How about, you're moving!"
288,Rachel,Look!
289,Rachel,This is ridiculous.
290,Rachel,We should be packing you!
291,Phoebe,"Hey, how are you guys doing?"
292,Rachel,Great!
293,Rachel,Monica's moving!
294,Monica,I am not!
295,Rachel,Oh really?!
296,Rachel,Then how come all your stuff is in this box?
297,Phoebe,"Okay, you guys."
298,Phoebe,You guys I think I know what's going on here.
299,Phoebe,"Okay, you guys STOP!!"
300,Phoebe,"I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that it'll make it easier to leave."
301,Phoebe,But deep down you're still really sad.
302,Phoebe,Deep-deep down.
303,Monica,No Phoebe I am mad!
304,Phoebe,"Well, deep-deep-deep down!"
305,Rachel,"Yeah, I'm just mad!"
306,Phoebe,Then keep running.
307,Chandler,You win.
308,Joey,"Well, what did you have?"
309,Chandler,It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six.
310,Chandler,That my friend is D-Cup.
311,Chandler,"Okay, now much have you won so far?"
312,Joey,"Uh,  wow, 700."
313,Chandler,Not 700 exactly?
314,Joey,Yeah.
315,Chandler,Double it!
316,Joey,What?
317,Chandler,"Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it."
318,Joey,Really?
319,Chandler,"Hey, I didn't make up the rules."
320,Chandler,"Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card."
321,Chandler,"Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500."
322,Chandler,Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you getNo way!
323,Monica,"Well, this is the last box of your clothes."
324,Monica,"I'm just gonna label it, ""What were you thinking?"""
325,Rachel,"Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler."
326,Phoebe,"Hey you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore."
327,Phoebe,Monica and
328,Rachel,What?
329,Phoebe,You're just so mean to each other!
330,Phoebe,And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel.
331,Phoebe,I still like you!
332,Rachel,"Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving."
333,Monica,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her!"
334,Monica,"Y'know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate."
335,Rachel,Oh really?
336,Rachel,Like what Monica?
337,Monica,"Y'know she has 147,000 pairs of boots"
338,Rachel,"Oh yeah, good start Mon."
339,Monica,She lets you borrow them.
340,Rachel,Yeah and you stretch em out with your big old clown feet.
341,Monica,Do you wanna live outside?!
342,Monica,Because it's gettin' cold!
343,Monica,"She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like."
344,Phoebe,What else?
345,Monica,"When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror."
346,Rachel,"Yeah, I do."
347,Rachel,"I-I do, do that."
348,Phoebe,That's nice.
349,Phoebe,I like having things to read in the bathroom.
350,Monica,"When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket."
351,Rachel,"Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold."
352,Monica,"And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive."
353,Monica,You were so great.
354,Monica,You made it so easy.
355,Monica,And now you have to leave.
356,Monica,And I have to live with a boy!
357,Rachel,"Oh, it's gonna be fine."
358,Phoebe,"Okay Rachel, I can't wait to live with you!"
359,Phoebe,And you know what we should do?
360,Phoebe,Bring Monica and then we could all live there together!
361,Phoebe,We'll have so much fun!
362,Rachel,"But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler."
363,Phoebe,Oh that's right.
364,Phoebe,You're still set on that?
365,Monica,Kinda.
366,Monica,Oh my God!
367,Ross,Hello?
368,Ross,"Hey Mon, how's the packing going?"
369,Ross,Ben?
370,Ross,He's fine.
371,Ross,"Yeah, he's rightOh my God!"
372,Ross,Get your head of your shirt there son!
373,Ross,What?
374,Ross,"Yeah, it's a pumpkin."
375,Ross,I'll come pack.
376,Joey,Hey!
377,Chandler,What's wrong?
378,Joey,"Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!"
379,Chandler,Wh-How did you lose at Cups?
380,Joey,The same way you lost.
381,Joey,"I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn!"
382,Joey,Ross gets a 2 and a 3.
383,Joey,"Then I get a Jack and a King, boom!"
384,Joey,Ross gets a 4 and a 5!
385,Joey,"Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus!"
386,Joey,"Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup!"
387,Joey,Nothin'!
388,Chandler,Oh man!
389,Joey,And he never played before either!
390,Joey,Y'know what I think?
391,Joey,"I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups."
392,Chandler,"All right, let's play one more hand!"
393,Chandler,One more!
394,Joey,"No, no, no more!"
395,Joey,I cannot lose another dime!
396,Joey,I'm serious this time!
397,Joey,"In-in fact, look, there's aI wanna give you something."
398,Joey,And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money.
399,Joey,"Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know, thank you for being such a great roommate."
400,Chandler,I can't take the big white dog!
401,Chandler,You love it!
402,Joey,"It's him, not it!"
403,Chandler,"No, but waitwhat if I bought it from you, y'know?"
404,Chandler,"And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say  $1,500?"
405,Joey,"Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here!"
406,Joey,You-you're trying to give me money again!
407,Chandler,When did I try to give you money?
408,Joey,Over there!
409,Joey,"Before, with the bills!"
410,Joey,"You tried to give some charity, I said ""No,"" you dropped it."
411,Joey,Okay?
412,Joey,"Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money!"
413,Joey,"Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!"
414,Chandler,I'm just trying to help you out!
415,Chandler,Okay?
416,Chandler,I wanna make sure that you're okay.
417,Joey,I will be okay!
418,Joey,"Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself."
419,Joey,Okay?
420,Joey,"Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money."
421,Joey,The only thing that I'm gonna missis you.
422,Joey,And now the dog.
423,Monica,Hey.
424,Monica,Call me when you get there.
425,Monica,Okay?
426,Rachel,Okay.
427,Monica,I'm really gonna miss you.
428,Rachel,Oh!
429,Rachel,I have your key.
430,Rachel,Here you go.
431,Monica,Thanks.
432,Rachel,Yeah.
433,Rachel,Oh God!
434,Rachel,"This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours!"
435,Monica,Yeah.
436,Rachel,Bye house!
437,Rachel,Bye Mon.
438,Monica,Bye.
439,Chandler,Hey.
440,Monica,She really left.
441,Chandler,I know.
442,Monica,Thank you.
443,Chandler,No problem roomie.
444,Monica,Can I ask you a question?
445,Chandler,Sure!
446,Monica,What the hell is that dog doing here?!
447,Monica,Ending Credits
448,Chandler,I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
449,Ross,And now you want that money back.
450,Chandler,Exactly.
451,Ross,"Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?"
452,Chandler,It's not a real game!
453,Chandler,I made it up!
454,Ross,"I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square."
455,Chandler,At a fake game!
456,Ross,"Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I'd be glad to play you for it."
457,Ross,"But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups."
458,Chandler,Okay!
459,Chandler,Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
460,Ross,No.
461,Chandler,"Hmm, let's see if it comes up this time."
462,Chandler,End
0,Ross,Happy birthday!!
1,Monica,Happy birthday!!
2,Monica,It's your birthday!
3,Chandler,She's not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
4,Joey,They do!
5,Phoebe,Rachel!
6,Phoebe,Come on out!
7,Phoebe,Monica made breakfast!
8,Monica,Chocolate-chip pancakes!
9,Ross,We've got presents!
10,Rachel,Good ones?
11,Monica,They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
12,Rachel,"Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?"
13,Joey,Come on Rach!
14,Joey,"Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal."
15,Ross,Oh really.
16,Ross,Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
17,Joey,Why God?!!
18,Joey,Why?!!
19,Joey,We had a deal!!
20,Joey,Let the others grow old!
21,Joey,Not me!
22,Rachel,"Y'know, I'm still 29 in Guam."
23,Ross,"Hey, 30 is not that old!"
24,Ross,Do you know how old the Earth is?
25,Rachel,Late thirties?
26,Rachel,Oh come on you guys!
27,Rachel,Is it just me?
28,Rachel,Am I overreacting to this?
29,Chandler,"No Rach, it's not just you."
30,Chandler,My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.
31,Joey,And now Chandler!
32,Joey,We're all gettin' so old!
33,Joey,Why are you doing this to us?!
34,Joey,Opening Credits
35,Monica,"Rach, you're in a great place in your life."
36,Monica,"Come on, you've got a great job!"
37,Monica,Good friends
38,Joey,"Yeah, you're roommate is a soap opera star."
39,Rachel,"Look, y'know I know my life's going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who've accomplished so many other goals by the time they're thirty."
40,Phoebe,"Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me."
41,Phoebe,[Flashback
42,Rachel,There you go!
43,Phoebe,I did it!
44,Phoebe,One mile on a hippity-hop!
45,Phoebe,That's it!!
46,Phoebe,That's everything I wanted to do before I was thirty.
47,Phoebe,"Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister."
48,Phoebe,But oh well.
49,Phoebe,Yay!!
50,Phoebe,And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean.
51,Rachel,Thirty.
52,Rachel,"Ugh, I mean thirty!"
53,Rachel,"Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade?"
54,Rachel,She was thirty!
55,Rachel,Nothing.
56,Rachel,I don't want to do anything.
57,Monica,"Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross."
58,Ross,Hey!
59,Ross,That was a practical purchase!
60,Ross,I needed that car for transportation!
61,Ross,Okay?
62,Ross,I-I have a child!
63,Ross,[Flashback
64,Ross,"How hot do I look in this, huh?"
65,Chandler,"Ross, a sports car?"
66,Chandler,Wouldn't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
67,Ross,That's not what this is about okay?
68,Ross,I-I am a sports car enthusiast.
69,Ross,I have always been into cars.
70,Joey,"Hey, what's the horsepower on this thing?"
71,Ross,"I don't know, but-but look how shiny!"
72,Monica,I can't believe you bought this.
73,Rachel,Really!
74,Rachel,"God Ross, what were you thinking?"
75,Rachel,"I know it's really shallow, but a part of me wants him again."
76,Phoebe,"Oh, well get in line missy."
77,Phoebe,"So, can I have a ride stud?"
78,Ross,Hop in.
79,Ross,Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
80,Ross,"Anyway, this being New York he is parallel parked on a street with the car in front of him only inches ahead of his bumper, likewise with the car behind him."
81,Ross,He's completely boxed in and can't move more than two inches.
82,Ross,He tries to get out several times by bumping the bumpers of both cars to no avail.)
83,Ross,Damnit!
84,Phoebe,"Okay, who's next?"
85,Rachel,Y'know what?
86,Rachel,I am going to do something today.
87,Rachel,I'm not just gonna sit around like some old lady.
88,Rachel,I'm gonna get something pierced.
89,Rachel,"Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something."
90,Phoebe,Really?!
91,Phoebe,Cause y'know that hurts.
92,Rachel,So what?!
93,Rachel,Y'know what?
94,Rachel,The way I see itOw!
95,Rachel,Son of a bitch!
96,Rachel,"Get out, get out of my apartment."
97,Monica,"All right Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you're doing great."
98,Monica,"I mean y'know let's face it, no one handles this well."
99,Phoebe,Least of all you.
100,Monica,Weren't you asked to leave sonny?
101,Chandler,Would you put that back on?!
102,Chandler,Monica's gonna be here any minute!
103,Joey,But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.
104,Chandler,"Okay, for the last time."
105,Chandler,It's not named for each individual man.
106,Chandler,Mrs.
107,Chandler,"Oh well, not as lovely as you."
108,Chandler,"I mean, I can't believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter!"
109,Chandler,And you!
110,Chandler,I can't believe that you would have a tux that's thirty years old!
111,Chandler,Mr.
112,Chandler,Ohh!
113,Rachel,Hey!
114,Rachel,Everybody hide!
115,Rachel,Hide!

121,Chandler,Everybody down!
122,Chandler,Mr.
123,Chandler,"Okay, everybody stay here."
124,Chandler,I will find out what's going on.
125,Monica,Heyyy!!
126,Monica,You got the door open!
127,Chandler,Hey-hey are you drunk?
128,Monica,Nooo!
129,Monica,Okay.
130,Monica,Whoa!
131,Monica,Okay.
132,Monica,"See I was, I was a little nervous about turning  thirty."
133,Monica,So the bus boys took me out for some drinks.
134,Monica,I wanna puke on you later!
135,Chandler,"Okay, here is the thing."
136,Chandler,We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there!
137,Chandler,All of your friends are in there and your parents!
138,Monica,Noo!!
139,Chandler,Yes!
140,Monica,Noo!
141,Chandler,Yes!
142,Monica,Oh no!
143,Monica,My parents have never seen me drunk!
144,Monica,That they know of.
145,Chandler,"Okay, here's the thing."
146,Chandler,We're gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you're drunk.
147,Monica,Really?!
148,Monica,You promise?
149,Chandler,"Yeah, I'll take care of it."
150,Monica,Okay.
151,Monica,I love you so much.
152,Chandler,Okay we have to do something about your breath.
153,Monica,What about your breath?
154,Chandler,That's still yours.
155,Chandler,"Okay, now remember it's a surprise party."
156,Chandler,"So, when you go in, act surprised."
157,Monica,Okay.
158,Monica,I can do that.
159,Chandler,Okay.
160,Ross,"Okay, forward."
161,Ross,ForwardStop!
162,Ross,"Okay, backStop!"
163,Ross,"Okay, forwardStop!"
164,Ross,Stop!
165,Ross,Stop!
166,Monica,"Ross, just forget about it."
167,Monica,This guy's got you totally wedged in.
168,Joey,Well actually
169,Ross,No-no-no!
170,Ross,It's mine!
171,Ross,It's-it's mine.
172,Joey,"Dude, you soooo need this car."
173,Phoebe,Okay.
174,Phoebe,"Okay, here's what we're gonna do."
175,Phoebe,"Okay, I'm gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral."
176,Phoebe,You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot.
177,Phoebe,Okay?
178,Phoebe,"All right, here we go."
179,Phoebe,Haul ass!!!
180,Phoebe,Happy thirtieth birthday!
181,Phoebe,Here!
182,Phoebe,"It's for the child in you, and the woman."
183,Phoebe,Happy thirtieth!
184,Phoebe,Because it's our thirtieth birthday.
185,Phoebe,Wait!
186,Phoebe,Yeah.
187,Phoebe,What?
188,Phoebe,Nu-uh!
189,Phoebe,You have your birth certificate?
190,Phoebe,Our mom.
191,Phoebe,Do you have my birth certificate?
192,Phoebe,Oh my God!
193,Phoebe,"Oh my God, we are 31."
194,Phoebe,I just lost a whole year of my life.
195,Phoebe,Your middle name is Pamela?
196,Phoebe,"Well, I never knew mine."
197,Phoebe,Do you remember what it is?
198,Phoebe,That's my first name.
199,Chandler,"Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress."
200,Monica,Yay!
201,Chandler,See?
202,Chandler,Here we go.
203,Chandler,Mr.
204,Monica,Paul!
205,Chandler,Phil.
206,Monica,Phil!
207,Chandler,"Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed."
208,Chandler,"Okay,  you're doing great."
209,Chandler,You're doing great.
210,Chandler,You're doing fine.
211,Phoebe,"Hey, what's going on?"
212,Chandler,Monica's a little drunk.
213,Phoebe,Yay!
214,Phoebe,I love drunk Monica!
215,Monica,Awwwww
216,Chandler,Go change!
217,Chandler,She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.
218,Phoebe,Ohh!
219,Phoebe,All right!
220,Phoebe,All right.
221,Phoebe,"Here's what we'll do, I'll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one's will even notice her."
222,Rachel,What's-what's going on?
223,Rachel,Phil's really pissed!
224,Chandler,Monica's wasted.
225,Ross,Maybe that will liven up this party.
226,Chandler,"Okay, will you just go help her change please!"
227,Rachel,"Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey."
228,Joey,Yep.
229,Rachel,Ahh!
230,Rachel,A scooter!
231,Ross,Stick to the list.
232,Ross,Always stick to the list.
233,Rachel,No!
234,Rachel,"No-no, I love it."
235,Rachel,Thank you.
236,Chandler,"Okay, open ours next."
237,Chandler,Open ours next!
238,Rachel,Okay.
239,Joey,"Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?"
240,Chandler,For my last birthday you gave me a hug!
241,Chandler,"Okay, read the card!"
242,Chandler,Read the card!
243,Rachel,Okay.
244,Rachel,Happy birthday Grandma!
245,Rachel,It's better to be over the hill  then buried under it.
246,Rachel,All our love Monica and Chandler.
247,Rachel,"That's funny, yeah!"
248,Chandler,No-no-no-no!
249,Chandler,That was the joke!
250,Rachel,"No, I know!"
251,Rachel,I get it!
252,Rachel,It's funny!
253,Chandler,"No, because you're not a grandmother!"
254,Rachel,"No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don't have any of those things."
255,Rachel,That's why it's so funny.
256,Monica,All you had to do was buy the card!
257,Ross,Hey!
258,Ross,Look who's back!
259,Ross,It's the birthday girl!
260,Ross,How's the birthday girl feeling?
261,Rachel,"Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids."
262,Ross,What?
263,Rachel,Okay!
264,Rachel,Y'know what?
265,Rachel,I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.
266,Rachel,All I really needed was a plan.
267,Rachel,See I wanna have three kids
268,Phoebe,"Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother."
269,Rachel,As I was saying I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35 which gives me five years.
270,Rachel,I love this plan!
271,Rachel,I wanna marry this plan!
272,Phoebe,"If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop."
273,Rachel,"So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34."
274,Rachel,Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes!
275,Rachel,"Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant"
276,Monica,Really!
277,Monica,That long?!
278,Monica,"Look all you want, it's happening!"
279,Rachel,"No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33!"
280,Rachel,"That's three years, that's three whole yearsOh, wait a minute though."
281,Rachel,"I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty."
282,Ross,Which is fine!
283,Ross,Because you just turnedtwenty-eight!
284,Rachel,No!
285,Rachel,"Ross, no!"
286,Rachel,It is not fine!
287,Rachel,Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!
288,Joey,Will you quit hoggin' it!
289,Joey,Commercial Break
290,Rachel,I'm telling you it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
291,Ross,You're drunk!
292,Ross,Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd!
293,Ross,Maybe I'm a little drunk.
294,Chandler,Oh that's great!
295,Chandler,Right there!
296,Chandler,Can we get some of that over here please?
297,Chandler,There we go.
298,Joey,Hey!
299,Joey,Are those crab cakes?
300,Joey,Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
301,Chandler,How are you feeling?
302,Monica,You are so handsome!
303,Monica,"I wanna make love to you right here, right now!"
304,Ross,I really wish that you wouldn't.
305,Chandler,"Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay?"
306,Chandler,"Then we can put you in bed, okay?"
307,Chandler,Just smile and don't talk to anyone.
308,Phoebe,Speech!
309,Phoebe,Speech!
310,Phoebe,Let's hear from the birthday girl!
311,Phoebe,Huh?
312,Chandler,Pheebs!
313,Phoebe,Don't you see?
314,Phoebe,Everyone's looking at me!
315,Phoebe,The plan's working!
316,Phoebe,I didn't even have to take off my top yet!
317,Phoebe,Mrs.
318,Ross,Come on!
319,Chandler,I think it's necessary.
320,Monica,I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming.
321,Monica,My family and my friends
322,Phoebe,Wooo!!
323,Phoebe,Hoo!
324,Monica,I really like to say that I'm-um  Y'know what I'd really like to say?
325,Monica,I'm drunk!!
326,Monica,That's right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!!
327,Monica,And guess what!
328,Monica,I've been drunk before!
329,Monica,And I've smoked a cigarette!
330,Monica,And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer!
331,Monica,It's all okay.
332,Monica,It's okay because I turned thirty today.
333,Monica,"And, and I can do anything I want!"
334,Monica,Because I am a grown up.
335,Phoebe,"Okay quick, help me get this off!"
336,Joey,Yeah!
337,Phoebe,I lost a whole year!
338,Phoebe,I can't believe it!
339,Phoebe,This is so unfair!
340,Joey,"Oh, I don't know Pheebs."
341,Joey,It'll be okay.
342,Phoebe,Will it?
343,Phoebe,Will it?!
344,Phoebe,"I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?"
345,Joey,That's not gonna happen.
346,Joey,No.
347,Joey,Because we have a new deal!
348,Phoebe,"Plus, it totally ruined my schedule!"
349,Phoebe,II haven't done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!
350,Joey,Like what?
351,Phoebe,"Like okay I-I-I, I haven't met any Portuguese people!"
352,Phoebe,"I, I haven't had the perfect kiss!"
353,Phoebe,And I haven't been to sniper's school!
354,Monica,"Phoebe, y'know why don't we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?"
355,Phoebe,"No, I just feel like being by myself for a while."
356,Phoebe,All right?
357,Phoebe,I'll see you guys later.
358,Phoebe,Thanks.
359,Rachel,Hey.
360,Rachel,"Oh, poor Pheebs."
361,Joey,"Hey, y'know what you guys?"
362,Joey,I think I'm gonna go walk her home.
363,Monica,Oh man!
364,Chandler,What?
365,Monica,He's gonna eat the cake!
366,Joey,Pheebs!
367,Joey,Wait up!
368,Joey,"Listen uh, close your eyes."
369,Joey,Maybe that's one thing you can cross off your list.
370,Phoebe,Oh yeah.
371,Joey,"Oh, and plus I'm 1/16th Portuguese."
372,Phoebe,Oh!
373,Ross,"Okay, is everybody clear?"
374,Ross,We're gonna pick it upand move it.
375,Ross,"Now all we need is teamwork, okay?"
376,Ross,We're gonna lift the carand slide it out.
377,Ross,Lift and slide!
378,Rachel,"Ross, I really don't think"
379,Ross,Lift!!
380,Ross,And slide!
381,Chandler,"Okay, here we go."
382,Ross,"All right everyone, lift!"

387,Rachel,"Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag."
388,Joey,Oh.

390,Joey,"Hey, can I ride this outside?"
391,Rachel,Whatever!
392,Rachel,"Okay, I'm not your mother."
393,Joey,Okay!
394,Rachel,Not in the street!
395,Joey,Yes!

404,Rachel,"Yeah, it is!"
405,Rachel,But you're just a kid!
406,Rachel,I mean you're 25!

409,Rachel,I wish you were six years older.
410,Rachel,"Well actually, if I'm wishin' for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger."
411,Rachel,"Yeah, I'm sorry."
412,Chandler,Hey!
413,Chandler,How'd it go?
414,Rachel,"Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?"
415,Phoebe,You did the right thing.
416,Joey,I don't like this anymore.
417,Chandler,"Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds."
418,Ross,"God, do you realize in ten years we're gonna be 40?"
419,Joey,Why God?!
420,Joey,Why are you doing this to us?
421,Ross,Yes!

430,Joey,Ending Credits {Transcriber's
0,Phoebe,"Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far."
1,Phoebe,"Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys."
2,Phoebe,"Finally Chandler was like ""forget about her"" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel."
3,Phoebe,"She was like, ""Oh my god."""
4,Phoebe,"So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman."
5,Phoebe,Uh-Oh!
6,Phoebe,"So, that's pretty much everything you need to know."
7,Phoebe,"But, enough about us."
8,Phoebe,"So, how've you been?"
9,Phoebe,Opening Credits

23,Rachel,What?
24,Ross,You're bleeding.
25,Rachel,I am?
26,Rachel,"Oh, look at that, yes I am."
27,Rachel,"Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient."
28,Rachel,Come on.
29,Rachel,I wanna hear everything!
30,Rachel,Everything.
31,Ross,"Well, where do I start?"
32,Ross,This is Julie.
33,Ross,"Julie, this is Rachel."
34,Rachel,"These are, these aren't for you."
35,Rachel,These are for you.
36,Rachel,Welcome to our country.
37,Rachel,"Ok, well, not a problem."
38,Rachel,We'll just use them to stop the bleeding.
39,Rachel,Ok. Baggage claim?
40,Rachel,Ok.
41,Chandler,No way!
42,Monica,"I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!"
43,Phoebe,Oh my god.
44,Phoebe,This is huge.
45,Phoebe,This is bigger than huge.
46,Phoebe,"This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?"
47,Joey,"Um, this?"
48,Phoebe,Yes.
49,Monica,"Guys, you got your hair cut."
50,Chandler,"Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay."
51,Phoebe,"'Cause, you know,  if you don't look good, we don't look good."
52,Phoebe,I love that voice.
53,Rachel,"Airport, airport."
54,Rachel,"Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her."
55,Rachel,"Cramp, cramp."
56,Chandler,"Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something."
57,Chandler,"Quick, get the verbs."
58,Rachel,"You, you, you said he liked me."
59,Rachel,"You, you slowpokes!"
60,Ross,"That's all right, Rach, we got the bags."
61,Ross,"Hi, hello."
62,Ross,"Julie, this is my sister Monica."
63,Ross,This is Chandler.
64,Ross,Phoebe.
65,Ross,"Joey, what up?"
66,Joey,What up?
67,Ross,"Everyone, this is Julie."
68,Rachel,Julie.
69,Ross,And bus.
70,Ross,The screaming guy?
71,Ross,You gotta hear this story.
72,Ross,200 at least.
73,Rachel,And the chicken pooped in her lap.
74,Rachel,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
75,Rachel,"I just gave away the ending, didn't I?"
76,Rachel,Oh!
77,Rachel,"It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about."
78,Monica,This is amazing.
79,Monica,"I mean, how, how did this happen?"
80,Ross,But we haven't seen each other since then.
81,Ross,"Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig."
82,Rachel,Julie!
83,Rachel,"Julie, isn't that great?"
84,Rachel,"I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?"
85,Monica,It's an expression.
86,Ross,"Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby."
87,Ross,"Yeah, it's really"
88,Chandler,"Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised."
89,Rachel,Bye.
90,Ross,"Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?"
91,Rachel,"Yeah, sure."
92,Ross,Thank you.
93,Chandler,"Hey, Rach, can I get..."
94,Rachel,Did you talk to him?
95,Chandler,Not yet.
96,Rachel,"Then, no."
97,Chandler,So what the hell happened to you in China?
98,Chandler,"I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know."
99,Ross,"I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on."
100,Ross,You know whose voice that was?
101,Chandler,God?
102,Ross,"It was you, pal."
103,Chandler,"Well, maybe it was God, doing me."
104,Ross,"Look, you were right."
105,Ross,"She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all."
106,Ross,"But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time."
107,Ross,"And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you."
108,Chandler,"Well, you owe me one, big guy."
109,Rachel,Here's your lemonade.
110,Ross,I didn't order lemonade.
111,Rachel,Oh.
112,Rachel,"Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that."
113,Ross,But...
114,Rachel,"Go-go-go-go, come on!"
115,Rachel,"So uh, what did you find out?"
116,Chandler,"He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time."
117,Chandler,I'm sorry.
118,Chandler,"But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself!"
119,Chandler,Without any outside help whatsoever.
120,Rachel,How is that the silver lining?
121,Chandler,You have to really wanna see it.
122,Ross,"Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym."
123,Monica,"Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?"
124,Phoebe,"Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?"
125,Monica,"No, although now that's what I'm thinking."
126,Phoebe,"All right, so what were you thinking?"
127,Monica,"Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?"
128,Phoebe,Ohh!
129,Phoebe,No.
130,Monica,Why not?
131,Phoebe,"Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak."
132,Monica,No you're not.
133,Phoebe,"I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings."
134,Joey,Hello?
135,Joey,"Oh, hi."
136,Joey,"Yeah, hold on a second."
137,Joey,"Ross, it's Julie, for you."
138,Ross,Hello?
139,Ross,Hi.
140,Chandler,Hi.
141,Chandler,Anybody know a good tailor?
142,Joey,Needs some clothes altered?
143,Chandler,"No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk."
144,Joey,Why don't you go see Frankie?
145,Joey,My family's been goin' to him forever.
146,Joey,He did my first suit when I was 15.
147,Joey,"No wait, 16."
148,Joey,"No, 'scuse me, 15."
149,Joey,"All right, when was 1990?"
150,Chandler,Okay.
151,Chandler,You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
152,Ross,"Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later."
153,Ross,"Ok, bye."
154,Ross,What?
155,Ross,"Oh, that is so sweet."
156,Ross,"No, no, ok, you hang up."
157,Ross,"Ok, ok, one, two, three."
158,Ross,Well you didn't hang up either.
159,Rachel,She didn't hang up either!
160,Ross,"Ok, no, no, you hang up."
161,Ross,"You, you, y..."
162,Rachel,"Sorry, I thought you were talking to me."
163,Ross,Rachel!
164,Ross,I'll just call her back.
165,Rachel,Okay!
166,Ross,Hi?
167,Ross,"Sorry, we got disconnected..."
168,Rachel,"Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me?"
169,Rachel,How did this happen to me?
170,Rachel,"A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine."
171,Rachel,"Ross was just Ross, just this guy."
172,Rachel,"Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have."
173,Monica,"Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too."
174,Rachel,I know you did.
175,Rachel,"I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it."
176,Rachel,I gotta get out of here.
177,Chandler,"Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her."
178,Joey,"You know, I think I was sixteen."
179,Monica,"Please, just a little bit off the back."
180,Phoebe,"I'm still on ""no."""
181,Rachel,"Uh, morning."
182,Rachel,Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
183,Joey,"No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again."
184,Phoebe,What's goin' on?
185,Rachel,"Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night."
186,Chandler,What stupid thing did you do?
187,Phoebe,Ewww!
188,Phoebe,Commercial Break
189,Rachel,"Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye."
190,Monica,"Rachel, how did this happen?"
191,Rachel,"I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night."
192,Phoebe,Where?
193,Rachel,At his apartment.
194,Rachel,Is this juice?
195,Joey,"Whoa, whoa."
196,Joey,And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
197,Rachel,"Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser."
198,Monica,"Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad."
199,Chandler,People do stupid things when they're upset.
200,Monica,"My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake."
201,Ross,Hi.
202,Ross,"Sorry we're late but we werewell, there was touching."
203,Ross,"Hey, Paulo."
204,Ross,What are you doing here?
205,Ross,"So, uh, he's back."
206,Rachel,"Yeah, he's back."
207,Rachel,Is that a problem?
208,Ross,"No, not a problem."
209,Rachel,Good!
210,Rachel,I'm glad it's not a problem.
211,Phoebe,"Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass."
212,Chandler,"Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered."
213,Joey,"Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello."
214,Joey,He'll know what it means.
215,Chandler,Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
216,Monica,"You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter."
217,Phoebe,All right.
218,Phoebe,"Ok, but, but!"
219,Phoebe,You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.
220,Monica,I promise.
221,Phoebe,All right.
222,Phoebe,"Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't."
223,Phoebe,But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.
224,Phoebe,"All right, that's it, I quit."
225,Monica,What?
226,Monica,I didn't say anything.
227,Phoebe,"Yeah, but this  isn't the face of a person who trusts a person."
228,Phoebe,"Ok, this  is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person."
229,Monica,I'm sorry.
230,Monica,"I'm sorry, Phoebe."
231,Monica,It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
232,Phoebe,Would you relax?
233,Phoebe,I know what I am doing.
234,Phoebe,This is how he wears it.
235,Monica,How who wears it?
236,Phoebe,Demi Moore.
237,Monica,Demi Moore is not a he.
238,Phoebe,"Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten."
239,Monica,That's Dudley Moore.
240,Monica,I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
241,Phoebe,Oh.
242,Phoebe,Oh!
243,Monica,Oh my God!
244,Phoebe,Oh my God!
245,Monica,Oh my God!
246,Phoebe,Oh my God!
247,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
248,Phoebe,Which one's Demi Moore?
249,Monica,"She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!"
250,Phoebe,"Oh, she's got gorgeous hair."
251,Monica,I know!
252,Chandler,At least as long as I have the pants.
253,Rachel,How is she?
254,Phoebe,It's too soon to tell.
255,Phoebe,"She's resting, which is a good sign."
256,Ross,How's the hair?
257,Phoebe,"I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good."
258,Phoebe,"I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling."
259,Joey,Can we see her?
260,Phoebe,"Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her."
261,Phoebe,"Ross, why don't you come on in."
262,Ross,Yeah.
263,Joey,How're you doing?
264,Rachel,I'm okay.
265,Joey,"Ooh, that bad, huh?"
266,Rachel,What?
267,Joey,"Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable."
268,Joey,It's one of my gifts.
269,Rachel,"When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom."
270,Rachel,"But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me."
271,Joey,You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
272,Rachel,Come on.
273,Rachel,How can I just tell him?
274,Rachel,What about Julie?
275,Joey,What about her?
276,Joey,They've only been going out for two weeks.
277,Joey,Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
278,Rachel,"I don't know, I don't know."
279,Joey,"Look, Rach, Rach!"
280,Joey,I've been with my share of women.
281,Joey,"In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women."
282,Joey,"The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you."
283,Chandler,"Yo, paisan!"
284,Chandler,Can I talk to you for a sec?
285,Chandler,Your tailor is a very bad man!
286,Joey,Frankie?
287,Joey,What're you talking about?
288,Ross,"Hey, what's goin' on?"
289,Chandler,Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
290,Ross,What?
291,Joey,No way.
292,Joey,I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
293,Chandler,Oh come on!
294,Chandler,"He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite..."
295,Ross,What?
296,Chandler,Cupping.
297,Joey,That's how they do pants!
298,Joey,"First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear."
299,Joey,What?
300,Joey,"Ross, Ross, would you tell him?"
301,Joey,Isn't that how they measure pants?
302,Ross,"Yes, yes it is."
303,Ross,In prison!
304,Ross,Whatsa matter with you?
305,Joey,What?
306,Joey,That's not?
307,Joey,Oh my God.
308,Monica,Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
309,Ross,I like it.
310,Ross,"I do, I think it's a Ten."
311,Monica,Thank you.
312,Monica,My hair is very amused.
313,Chandler,"Come on, Monica, things could be worse."
314,Chandler,You could get caught between the moon and New York City.
315,Chandler,"I know it's crazy, but it's true."
316,Phoebe,Thank you.
317,Ross,"Well, I gotta go."
318,Ross,Bye.
319,Ross,"Bye, Rach."
320,Rachel,"Wait, are you leaving?"
321,Ross,"Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by ""bye!"""
322,Rachel,"Well, can I talk to you for a sec?"
323,Ross,Okay.
324,Joey,"Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test..."
325,Chandler,That's ok.
326,Ross,What's goin' on?
327,Rachel,"Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together."
328,Rachel,"It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't."
329,Rachel,"Um, second of all , what?"
330,Ross,"Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?"
331,Rachel,No.
332,Rachel,No-no-no-no.
333,Ross,"Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum."
334,Ross,I hate him.
335,Ross,I mean I actuallyI-I physically hate him.
336,Ross,I always have.
337,Ross,You are way too good to be with a guy like that.
338,Rachel,Really?
339,Ross,"You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know?"
340,Ross,"Someone who wakes up every morning thinking ""Oh my god, I'm with Rachel""."
341,Ross,"You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie."
342,Ross,Was there a second of all?
343,Rachel,"No, I think that was the whole all."
344,Ross,Okay.
345,Ross,Okay.
346,Ross,Okay.
347,Joey,"I swear to god, Dad."
348,Joey,That's not how they measure pants.
349,Joey,Closing Credits
350,Phoebe,Oh yeah!
351,Phoebe,"Oh, I can do that."
352,Phoebe,You wanna do it right now?
353,Phoebe,"Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time."
354,Phoebe,"Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?"
355,Rachel,No.
356,Rachel,No no no no no.
357,Rachel,That's Rodney McDowell.
358,Rachel,Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.
359,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah."
360,Phoebe,"Ok, thank you."

5,Phoebe,What's your news?
6,Chandler,Thank you.
7,Chandler,I got a job in advertising.
8,Monica,"Oh, honey, that's incredible!"
9,Phoebe,"Gosh, what's the pay like?"
10,Phoebe,"Oh, come on people  come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most!"
11,Phoebe,Hey Joey!
12,Chandler,"Actually, it pays nothing."
13,Chandler,It's an internship.
14,Joey,"Oh, that's cool."
15,Joey,We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'.
16,Chandler,Right.
17,Chandler,"So, it'll be the same except less sex with you."
18,Ross,"So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?"
19,Chandler,"Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like."
20,Phoebe,That's great.
21,Chandler,"Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating"
22,Chandler,Humiliating and noble!
23,Ross,"You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising."
24,Monica,"Ross, you did not come up with ""got milk?"""
25,Ross,"Yes, I did, I did!"
26,Ross,I should have written it down!
27,Ross,Opening Credits
28,Joey,Hey!

43,Rachel,You got that audition.
44,Joey,With Lennart Haze?
45,Rachel,Yes.
46,Joey,"Oh my god, that is great!"
47,Joey,"That is *** for a play on broadway and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time."
48,Monica,Is it a good play?
49,Joey,"Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe word."
50,Rachel,"Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it"
51,Joey,"Yeah, yeah, and directing."
52,Monica,He was so good in that movie of MacBeth.

63,Monica,Hey!
64,Monica,Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!
65,Joey,Don't make me more nervous than I already am!
66,Chandler,"Good morning, everybody."
67,Chandler,"Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys except for the tie, the briefcase and the fact that I can rent a car."
68,Chandler,"Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom."
69,Chandler,Right.
70,Chandler,"Look, I know I'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope"
71,Chandler,The comedian?
72,Chandler,USO?
73,Joey,It is so amazing to meet you.
74,Joey,I'm such a big fan of your work.
75,Joey,Tell me about it!
76,Joey,"""Unlimited nights and weekends!"""
77,Joey,"No, I-I-I wasn't making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were great in those commercials."
78,Joey,Yeah.
79,Joey,Are you kiddin'?
80,Joey,When they shoot you out of that cannon
81,Joey,Wow!
82,Joey,"Oh, yah, sure."
83,Joey,"Err, ""I think you know""."
84,Joey,"""I am what you made me."
85,Joey,You know what?
86,Joey,"I could go right now."""
87,Joey,"""I can't."
88,Joey,"Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can't."""
89,Joey,"Oh, oh, I thought that was your character's name, you know, I thought you were like an Indian or something, you know with a"
90,Joey,"Ah, y-y-you're sure you don't want me to do it again?"
91,Joey,"I could do it with an accent, you know, Southern  ""I could go right now, maaan!"""
92,Joey,"Ah, hi, ah."
93,Joey,"Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did wrong, I'd just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you."
94,Joey,"And, and"
95,Joey,Yeah.
96,Joey,I really doubt that.
97,Joey,Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?
98,Phoebe,"Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?"
99,Ross,"Oh, I can't."
100,Ross,"I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her."
101,Phoebe,"Oh, I hear divorce bells."
102,Ross,What?
103,Ross,"O-ok. Just relax, Phoene, just stay calm."
104,Ross,"Oh my god, I can't find my wallet."
105,Phoebe,No.
106,Ross,"What do you mean ""no""?"
107,Ross,"I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay."
108,Phoebe,"Lowell, is that you?"
109,Phoebe,Oh my god!
110,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets."
111,Phoebe,"Lowell, Ross."
112,Ross,"Yeah, a real pleasure."
113,Phoebe,"Ah, it's been so long, so long."
114,Phoebe,I can't believe you're still doing this!
115,Phoebe,Good for you!
116,Phoebe,Ouh
117,Ross,Oh my god.
118,Ross,"Phoebe, you used to mug people?"
119,Phoebe,"Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up"
120,Monica,"Hey, how did the audition go?"
121,Joey,"Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me."
122,Monica,What happened?
123,Joey,"Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical."
124,Joey,"Oh, and he said that I should think less."
125,Monica,So far so good!
126,Chandler,"Honey, I'm old!"
127,Monica,What's wrong?
128,Chandler,I am so much older than these other interns.
129,Chandler,I can't compete with them.
130,Monica,So you're a little older.
131,Monica,Try to look at the
132,Chandler,"Yes, but I don't think life experience with these."
133,Joey,Wooooooooow  It's like they're on fire!
134,Monica,What are they?
135,Chandler,They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.
136,Joey,I give you $ 500 for them!
137,Chandler,What am I supposed to do with these?
138,Monica,"Ah, come on, sneakers are easy."
139,Monica,You wear sneakers all the time.
140,Chandler,"Well, first of all, they're not called ""sneakers"" anymore."
141,Chandler,"Apparently, they're called ""kicks"" or ""skids"" and I think I heard somebody say ""slorps""."
142,Chandler,"And here,"
143,Monica,"Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?"
144,Chandler,"No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for."
145,Joey,"Hey, that'd work on me!"
146,Joey,Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords?
147,Ross,"Hey, you'll never guess what just happened Phoebe and I got mugged!"
148,Monica,You okay?
149,Ross,"Yah, because Phoebe knew the mugger!"
150,Monica,How do you know a mugger?
151,Phoebe,I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us.
152,Ross,You wanna know how she knew him?
153,Ross,Because Phoebe used to mug people.
154,Monica,Seriously?
155,Phoebe,"Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I"
156,Monica,"Phoebe, that is awful!"
157,Phoebe,"Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer"
158,Monica,You're mother killed herself!
159,Phoebe,She was a drug dealer!
160,Ross,"Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because  I was about to do some serious damage!"
161,Phoebe,Okay
162,Monica,"Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross."
163,Phoebe,Why?
164,Monica,"Well, Ross was mugged as a kid."
165,Phoebe,You were?
166,Ross,"Yeah, it was pretty traumatic."
167,Ross,"I was outside St. Marc's Comics you know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week-"
168,Monica,Wonderwoman!
169,Ross,"Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone   when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and"
170,Phoebe,Oh my god
171,Ross,I know!
172,Ross,And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic
173,Monica,Oh yeah!
174,Monica,What was his superpower again?
175,Ross,A superhuman thirst for knowledge.
176,Monica,That's it.
177,Ross,"Well, I-I better get to class  Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe?"
178,Phoebe,"No actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street that's where stabby Joe works."
179,Phoebe,"Okay, I think we have a problem here."
180,Monica,What?
181,Phoebe,"Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics."
182,Monica,Yeah?
183,Phoebe,"Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat."
184,Monica,So?
185,Phoebe,"Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said- Phoebe and"
186,Monica,"""Geology rocks!"""
187,Monica,Oh my god!
188,Phoebe,I know I mugged Ross!
189,Joey,"I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?"
190,Joey,But I'm bursting with u-hu!
191,Joey,"Actually, I really need"
192,Joey,Yes ahahaaa
193,Joey,"""I think you know!"""
194,Joey,"""I am what you made me!"
195,Joey,"You know what?"""
196,Joey,"""I could go right now."""
197,Joey,"""I, oh, I can't."
198,Joey,"I want to, but I can't!"""
199,Joey,I did?
200,Joey,"Sure, yeah."
201,Joey,I don't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go.
202,Monica,Hey!
203,Chandler,Hey!
204,Monica,What are you doing?
205,Chandler,"Putting on the sneakers thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything"
206,Rachel,"Oh, anything yet?"
207,Chandler,"Yes, how's"
208,Joey,Hey!
209,Joey,Probably wanna know what I'm doing?
210,Monica,"No, that seems about right."
211,Joey,"Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor."
212,Joey,"I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything."
213,Joey,"Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!"
214,Rachel,"Joey, that was formula."
215,Joey,We gotta get more of that.
216,Chandler,You know what these aren't half-bad!
217,Chandler,You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.
218,Rachel,"Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph."
219,Chandler,Alright  I feel youger already!
220,Chandler,"Yah, I think I broke my hip."
221,Phoebe,"Hey, you!"
222,Ross,Hey!
223,Phoebe,"Hey, how was class?"
224,Ross,"No one ever asked me that, what's wrong?"
225,Phoebe,"Nothing, I really wanna know."
226,Ross,"Oh  Well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene"
227,Phoebe,"Alright, nothing is worth this."
228,Phoebe,"Uhm, I have a confession to make uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid"
229,Ross,Wh-What are you talking about?
230,Ross,It wasn't a girl.
231,Ross,It was this huge dude.
232,Phoebe,"You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl."
233,Ross,"No, it wasn't."
234,Phoebe,"Yes, it was."
235,Ross,"No, it wasn't."
236,Ross,You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old
237,Phoebe,"""Gimme your money, punk!"""
238,Ross,"Oh my god, it was you!"
239,Ross,"I can't believe it, you you mugged me?"
240,Phoebe,"Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat."
241,Phoebe,"I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have have a great one!"
242,Ross,It's not the best!
243,Phoebe,"I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me."
244,Phoebe,I don't know what to say
245,Ross,There's nothing you can say.
246,Ross,That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me.
247,Phoebe,Really?
248,Phoebe,Even more humiliating than
249,Ross,"Hey, let's not do this!"
250,Chandler,Okay  You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes.
251,Chandler,He's about my age
252,Chandler,A-huh.
253,Chandler,"So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know maybe he falls maybe hurts himself."
254,Chandler,"Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes."
255,Chandler,"He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line"
256,Chandler,"Oh, thank you, sir or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me"
257,Chandler,"I don't know, I don' I don' know!"
258,Chandler,"I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow."
259,Chandler,The cold weather hurts my hip!
260,Phoebe,"Hey, Ross!"
261,Phoebe,"I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second?"
262,Ross,"Sure, go ahead."
263,Ross,"Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead."
264,Phoebe,I just really wanted to apologize again and and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting.
265,Ross,"Oh my god, crap from the street?"
266,Phoebe,"Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell or smoke."
267,Phoebe,"Anyway, I was looking through it and I found ""Science Boy"""
268,Ross,Oh my god.
269,Ross,I never thought I'd see this again.
270,Ross,It's all here.
271,Ross,What made you save it all these years?
272,Phoebe,"I can't say, I just thought it was really good and maybe would be worth something some day."
273,Ross,"You really thought ""Science Boy"" was worth saving!"
274,Phoebe,"Yeah but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here."
275,Ross,"Still this is amazing Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe."
276,Phoebe,You're welcome.
277,Phoebe,"And thank you for ""Science Boy""."
278,Phoebe,I learned a lot from him
279,Ross,You're welcome.
280,Joey,"""I need an answer!"""
281,Joey,"""You know!"""
282,Joey,"""I need an answer now!"""
283,Joey,Oh!
284,Joey,"""You knew this all along and you never told me?"
285,Joey,You never told me?
286,Joey,"I can never forgive you, I can never forgive myself, I have nothing to live for  Bang  End Scene!"""
287,Joey,"Oh thanks, thanks!"
288,Joey,"Now, I really have to get"
289,Monica,"Wow, that's a big cable bill!"
290,Monica,"Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn on a Saturday afternoon?!"
291,Monica,I was in the house!
292,Ross,"Hey, uhm, Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that"
293,Monica,that she was the huge guy that mugged you?
294,Monica,Yah.
295,Ross,I see.
296,Ross,You didn't happen to tell
297,Monica,everybody we know?
298,Monica,Yeah.
299,Ross,Great.
300,Ross,Thanks!
301,Ross,End

5,Phoebe,Oh my God!
6,Ross,It's all right.
7,Phoebe,"Oh no, none of them are the father."
8,Phoebe,The father is my brother.
9,Rachel,I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
10,Joey,"Okay, uh Pheebs, quick."
11,Joey,Look!
12,Joey,"This  is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say?"
13,Joey,Y'know before it all starts?

15,Phoebe,"Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe."
16,Phoebe,I can't wait to see you.
17,Phoebe,Please don't hurt me!
18,Ross,"Hey, what took you guys so long?"
19,Ross,Your cab left when ours did!
20,Monica,"Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket."
21,Chandler,That's right.
22,Rachel,You-you're not wearing a jacket.
23,Monica,Oh man!
24,Monica,I did it again!
25,Phoebe,"Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice."
26,Phoebe,"And then my mom wants to know--Joey, what are you doing?"
27,Joey,I gotta get the before shot!
28,Joey,Opening Credits
29,Rachel,"Hi, Pheebs?"
30,Rachel,"Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming."
31,Phoebe,What?
32,Ross,Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
33,Phoebe,"Oh my God, she's so stupid!"
34,Ross,"Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay."
35,Phoebe,"That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your vagina!"
36,Rachel,"Honey, listen, y'know what?"
37,Rachel,The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
38,Ross,"Yeah, he's head of the department."
39,Phoebe,All rightOoh!
40,Phoebe,"Oh dead God, save me!"
41,Monica,What?
42,Phoebe,I'm having my first contraction!

54,Joey,I didn't know I cared that much.
55,Ross,Hello.
56,Ross,Dr.
57,Chandler,"Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?"
58,Monica,That's what it sounded like.
59,Chandler,All right
60,Phoebe,No-no-no!
61,Phoebe,We haven't started yet.
62,Phoebe,Where's Alice?
63,Chandler,"Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing."
64,Rachel,Monica?
65,Rachel,You gonna be very proud of me.
66,Rachel,I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
67,Joey,Oh my!
68,Rachel,They're male nurses.
69,Joey,Not in my head.
70,Rachel,"Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night!"
71,Rachel,What do you say?
72,Monica,Umm.
73,Monica,Umm.
74,Monica,Umm.
75,Monica,I don't think so.
76,Rachel,What?
77,Rachel,What are you talking about?!
78,Rachel,You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on.
79,Rachel,"I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me."
80,Rachel,"Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go."
81,Monica,"Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true."
82,Rachel,What?
83,Monica,Harder than it sounds.
84,Monica,Isn't it?
85,Rachel,"Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them."
86,Joey,Yep!
87,Joey,There's always room for Jell-O
88,Rachel,"Joey, how do you make that dirty?"
89,Joey,"Oh, it's easy."
90,Joey,"Yeah, I-I can do it with anything."
91,Joey,"Watch uh,  Grandma's chicken salad"
92,Joey,Ross!

94,Joey,Hey babies!
95,Joey,These are the headlines on the day you were born!
96,Joey,"Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies  Check it out, huh?!"
97,Joey,This is what naked women looked like the month you were born.
98,Joey,"All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff."

108,Joey,"Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out."
109,Joey,Maybe they're with them.
110,Chandler,Really?

112,Joey,"Yeah, I was bummed too."
113,Chandler,So they're going on dates?
114,Chandler,When?
115,Joey,I think Saturday.
116,Phoebe,"Umm, sympathy pains."
117,Phoebe,"I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder."
118,Phoebe,Dr.
119,Phoebe,Hey.
120,Phoebe,Dr.
121,Chandler,"This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?"
122,Chandler,Dr.
123,Chandler,All right.
124,Phoebe,It's very weird!
125,Phoebe,"I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!"
126,Ross,"To be fair, he doesn't seem to be impersonating Fonzie"
127,Phoebe,What are you doing?!!
128,Phoebe,Why are you defending him?!
129,Phoebe,Just get me another doctor!
130,Phoebe,One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
131,Ross,"Again, it's not that he"
132,Chandler,Oh-hey-hey-hey!
133,Chandler,There you are!
134,Monica,"Umm, listen there's something I think you should know."
135,Chandler,"Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse?"
136,Chandler,"Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine."
137,Chandler,"I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around."
138,Monica,"Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him."
139,Chandler,Fine!
140,Chandler,Maybe I will too!
141,Joey,"Hey, you guys!"
142,Joey,Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop.

149,Phoebe,And you're going into what grade?
150,Phoebe,Dr.
151,Phoebe,"Uh-huh, me too."
152,Phoebe,"Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor."
153,Phoebe,Dr.
154,Phoebe,Shh!
155,Phoebe,"Doogie, shh!"
156,Phoebe,Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon?

198,Phoebe,Okay?
199,Phoebe,"Just, y'know, feel him out!"
200,Rachel,No!
201,Rachel,Forget it!
202,Rachel,I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!

297,Chandler,"Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together."
298,Chandler,"But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary."
299,Chandler,I am so bad at this.

342,Chandler,"So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?"
343,Phoebe,They're gonna call her Chandler.
344,Chandler,"That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?"

346,Phoebe,End
0,Phoebe,Oh my God!
1,Phoebe,I can't believe my little brother is married!

27,Joey,"Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum."
28,Joey,"Yeah, Ross got it for me."
29,Rachel,"Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?"
30,Joey,"No, not really."
31,Joey,"They give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script."
32,Joey,"""And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period."

52,Phoebe,"It's her-it's her egg and her sperm, and I'm-I'm just the oven, it's totally their bun."
53,Joey,Huh.
54,Monica,What did you tell them?
55,Phoebe,"Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about?"
56,Phoebe,I'm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.
57,Chandler,You're gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
58,Rachel,"Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about."
59,Monica,"Yeah, like you're gonna be pregnant."
60,Monica,I mean pregnant.
61,Phoebe,I know!
62,Ross,"Pheebs, you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot, I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it's all for somebody else!"
63,Phoebe,"Yeah, what's your point?"
64,Ross,"Well, the stuff I just mentioned."
65,Rachel,Wow!
66,Rachel,I don't know if I could ever do that.
67,Rachel,I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be akeeper.
68,Phoebe,Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
69,Joey,"No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy."
70,Monica,We just want you to think it through.
71,Rachel,"Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who's had a baby."
72,Rachel,Like your mom?
73,Phoebe,My mom never gave birth.
74,Phoebe,Oh!
75,Phoebe,But my birth mom did.
76,Chandler,"Oh, yeah, sure, it's not mine anyway."
77,Chandler,It can with the pants.
78,Monica,I am so jealous.
79,Rachel,You guys are really rightthere aren't you?
80,Chandler,Yes.
81,Chandler,Right where?
82,Monica,In the beginning where y'know it's all sex and talking and sex and talking and
83,Chandler,"Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking."
84,Monica,And the sex?
85,Chandler,"All right, we haven't had sex yet."
86,Chandler,"Okay, what's the big deal?"
87,Chandler,Y'know?
88,Chandler,"This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level."
89,Rachel,"Oh, Chandler that is so nice."
90,Ross,That is really nicelying!
91,Ross,No way is that the reason!
92,Rachel,Why?
93,Rachel,Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?
94,Chandler,"No, he's right, I'm totally lying."
95,Monica,Then what is it?
96,Chandler,"Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey."
97,Ross,And you're afraid you won't be able tofill his shoes.
98,Chandler,"No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him."
99,Ross,"Yeah, I was going for the metaphor."
100,Chandler,"Yes, and I was saying the actual words."
101,Monica,"So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed."
102,Chandler,We share a wall!
103,Chandler,"So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot."
104,Monica,"Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different."
105,Monica,"The sex is gonna be great, cause you-you guys are in love."
106,Chandler,Yeah?
107,Rachel,Yeah!
108,Ross,Just go for it Chandler.
109,Monica,"Yeah, you should."
110,Rachel,"Yeah, you should, really."
111,Monica,Go on.
112,Chandler,"All right, all right, I'll go sleep with my girlfriend."
113,Chandler,But I'm just doing it for you guys.
114,Joey,"Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period."
115,Joey,Smart
116,Joey,Shhh!
117,Joey,"This is a museum, no talking."
118,Joey,"Right down here,  we have a large foot."
119,Joey,"Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller."
120,Joey,Everyone wave Hi' to Ross.
121,Joey,"Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work."
122,Joey,"Okay, moving right along."
123,Joey,Come on.
124,Phoebe,Hi!
125,Phoebe,Phoebe
126,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, I'm late."
127,Phoebe,Phoebe
128,Phoebe,Wow!
129,Phoebe,You really go all out when you're expecting company.
130,Phoebe,Phoebe
131,Phoebe,Oh!
132,Phoebe,Ooh!
133,Phoebe,"Oh, I didn't know that you didpot."
134,Phoebe,Phoebe
135,Phoebe,"Ooh, erotiery!"
136,Phoebe,Phoebe
137,Phoebe,Okay.
138,Phoebe,Phoebe
139,Phoebe,Why not?
140,Phoebe,Phoebe
141,Phoebe,Oh no!
142,Phoebe,No-no!
143,Phoebe,I understand the pain!
144,Phoebe,Don't-don't hurt the puppy.
145,Phoebe,Phoebe
146,Phoebe,"Oh, I get a puppy!!"
147,Phoebe,Phoebe
148,Phoebe,Why?
149,Phoebe,Phoebe
150,Phoebe,Okay.
151,Phoebe,Phoebe
152,Phoebe,"All right, I'm sorry."
153,Joey,"Uhh, do you mind sitting there."
154,Joey,I'm-I'm saving this for my friend Ross.
155,Joey,Tour
156,Joey,Doctor?
157,Joey,Wow!
158,Joey,I didn't know he had a nickname.
159,Joey,Tour
160,Joey,"Well, how-how come?"
161,Joey,Tour
162,Joey,That's crazy.
163,Joey,Tour
164,Joey,I-I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you.
165,Joey,"Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it!"
166,Joey,Ross!
167,Joey,Ross!
168,Joey,"Over here, man!"
169,Joey,I-I saved you seat.
170,Ross,"That's okay, I'm cool over here."
171,Ross,"I'll catch up with you later, Joey."
172,Ross,Tour
173,Ross,"Hey, uh, I'm really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today."
174,Joey,It's no big deal.
175,Joey,"Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do."
176,Joey,Right?
177,Ross,"But hey, it's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together."
178,Joey,Whatever.
179,Ross,"It's like that everywhere, Joey!"
180,Ross,"Okay, Mon, back me up here."
181,Ross,"Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right?"
182,Ross,"And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?"
183,Monica,I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
184,Joey,"Look, Ross, really it's-it's no big deal."
185,Joey,"Y'know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then so be it."
186,Joey,"Y'know, hey I understand."
187,Joey,Y'know?
188,Joey,"Hey, when I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right?"
189,Joey,"So it's y'know, it's uh, it's cool."
190,Joey,I'll see you tomorrow.
191,Rachel,"Yeah, when we're in the audience he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave."
192,Chandler,Hi.
193,Monica,Hey!
194,Chandler,Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
195,Phoebe,"Ooh, y'know what, I think it's time for puppy to go out again."
196,Phoebe,"Come on, let's go to the balcony."
197,Monica,What?
198,Phoebe,"Umm, the street."
199,Phoebe,"Come on, let's go to the street."
200,Phoebe,"Ooh, listen, don't go onto the balcony until after I get back."
201,Monica,"So, did you do it?"
202,Chandler,"Yes, yes, we had the sex."
203,Monica,"Uh-oh, it was bad?"
204,Chandler,"It was fine, y'know?"
205,Chandler,But she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey.
206,Chandler,"She was more like, ""I see you point, I'm all right with it."""
207,Monica,"Well, it was the first time."
208,Monica,"Y'know, there's not always a lot of agreement the first time."
209,Rachel,"Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree  like that."
210,Chandler,"Look, you have to help me!"
211,Chandler,Okay?
212,Chandler,"I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice."
213,Chandler,"But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, ""My God!"
214,Chandler,"Somebody's killing her in there!"""
215,Monica,"All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know."
216,Monica,"Rach, give me that pad, please?"
217,Monica,All right.
218,Monica,Now
219,Chandler,"Look, you don't have to draw an actual wowhoa!"
220,Chandler,She's hot!
221,Monica,Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones.
222,Monica,"You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!"
223,Chandler,There are seven?
224,Rachel,Let me see that.
225,Rachel,"Oh, yeah."
226,Chandler,That's one?
227,Monica,It's kind of an important one!
228,Chandler,"Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down."
229,Rachel,"Well, y'know, sometimes that helps."
230,Monica,"Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp."
231,Chandler,That-that's bad?
232,Rachel,"Well if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Materhorn."
233,Chandler,Well you might if it were anything like 7!
234,Monica,"All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit em all, and you mix em up."
235,Monica,You gotta keep them on their toes.
236,Rachel,"Oo, toes!!"
237,Rachel,"Well, for some people."
238,Monica,All right.
239,Monica,"Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4,  2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, 7..77-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7!"
240,Ross,"Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle."
241,Ross,"I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me."
242,Joey,I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
243,Ross,"Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch."
244,Ross,"Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division."
245,Ross,"Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, ""My God why?!"""
246,Ross,"Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath."
247,Ross,I'm Ross!
248,Ross,"I'm divorced, and I have a kid!"
249,Joey,I'm Joey!
250,Joey,I'm an actor!
251,Joey,I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
252,Joey,Another Tour
253,Ross,"All right, there you go!"
254,Joey,"Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!"
255,Joey,Older
256,Ross,"Okay, good-good for you."
257,Ross,Tour
258,Ross,"Wow, Rhonda."
259,Ross,Another
260,Ross,"Yeah, okay, Scott!"
261,Ross,Another
262,Phoebe,My mom's gonna be here any minute.
263,Phoebe,"I can't do this, I can't give him up."
264,Phoebe,"Yesno, I can."
265,Phoebe,I don't want to.
266,Phoebe,But I can.
267,Phoebe,No.
268,Rachel,"Oo, I can't watch this, it's like Sophie's Choice."
269,Monica,"Y'know, I never saw that."
270,Rachel,"Ooh, it was only okay."
271,Phoebe,"Ooh, I can't do this."
272,Phoebe,My mom was right.
273,Phoebe,"If I can't-if I can't give him up, then there's no way I can give up a baby."
274,Phoebe,"Ohh, God, Frank and Alice are gonna be so crushed."
275,Phoebe,"What-what else, what else can I give ema kidney!"
276,Phoebe,Okay.
277,Phoebe,Oh!
278,Phoebe,Ooh!
279,Phoebe,Umm!
280,Phoebe,"Hey, why don't you?"
281,Phoebe,"Uh-huh, yeah!"
282,Monica,What are you doing?
283,Phoebe,"No, I'm really okay with this."
284,Phoebe,Y'know why?
285,Phoebe,"Cause look at them, and I made that, so I know it's gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God, it's gonna feel like a million times better, right?"
286,Phoebe,I wanna do this.
287,Phoebe,I wanna carry your baby.
288,Monica,It's gonna be so great.
289,Monica,Phoebe
290,Phoebe,"Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided I'm gonna carry their baby."
291,Phoebe,Phoebe
292,Phoebe,"No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this."
293,Phoebe,Phoebe
294,Phoebe,Oh!
295,Phoebe,Closing Credits
296,Monica,Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
297,Rachel,It depends on who asked.
298,Monica,What if I asked?
299,Rachel,"Oh, Mon, sure."
300,Monica,Really?
301,Rachel,Yes.
302,Rachel,You're not asking are you?
303,Monica,No.
304,Rachel,Yes!
305,Rachel,Totally!
0,Monica,Hey.
1,Chandler,Hey.
2,Monica,Oh my God!
3,Monica,You cleaned!
4,Monica,Look at these floors!
5,Monica,You did the windows!
6,Monica,"Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did!"
7,Monica,You cleaned!
8,Monica,And nagging works!
9,Chandler,"Y'know uh, I didn't actually do this."
10,Monica,"Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?"
11,Chandler,"No, it wasn't you."
12,Monica,Well then who?
13,Chandler,I got a maid.
14,Chandler,Yay!
15,Monica,"I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then"
16,Chandler,"Uh honey, I know you don't like to relinquish control"
17,Monica,"Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!"
18,Chandler,"Look, she's really nice."
19,Chandler,Okay?
20,Chandler,And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.
21,Monica,Did she really say that?
22,Chandler,"Yes, I distinctly remember cause I thought it was a joke."
23,Chandler,"Now just give her a chance, okay?"
24,Monica,"Fine, I can do it."
25,Monica,Whew.
26,Chandler,What's the matter?
27,Monica,"Well, usually when I'm this anxious, I clean!"
28,Monica,Opening Credits
29,Phoebe,Who's cell phone is that?
30,Phoebe,It's just so annoying; everywhere you go.
31,Ross,I think it's coming from your bag.
32,Phoebe,I never get calls!!
33,Phoebe,Hello?
34,Phoebe,Oh my God Eric hi!
35,Phoebe,"Wait, how'd you get this number?"
36,Phoebe,Wow!
37,Phoebe,What an incredible violationand wonderful surprise.
38,Phoebe,Oh you did?
39,Phoebe,He did it!
40,Phoebe,He did it!
41,Rachel,Wow!
42,Rachel,What did he do?
43,Phoebe,Shhh!
44,Phoebe,I'm talking.
45,Phoebe,Are you asking me out?
46,Phoebe,Cause it would be kinda weird since you just broke up with my sister.
47,Phoebe,No!
48,Phoebe,Wait!
49,Phoebe,I was just saying that so you'd think I was a good person.
50,Phoebe,Fight for me.
51,Phoebe,"Not great, but we can work on it at lunch."
52,Phoebe,"Okay, I can be at your apartment in two hours."
53,Phoebe,I've got friends too.
54,Phoebe,"Okay, bye."
55,Phoebe,Oh my God!
56,Phoebe,I'm going out with Eric!
57,Phoebe,"Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be."
58,Phoebe,"Oh Ross, I can't make lunch."
59,Ross,So apparently I'm available for lunch.
60,Rachel,I can't.
61,Rachel,I'm busy.
62,Rachel,I'm apartment hunting.
63,Ross,You're moving?
64,Rachel,"Yeah, I can't live with Joey once the baby comes."
65,Rachel,"I don't want my child's first words to be,  ""How you doin'?"""
66,Ross,So does-does Joey know you're moving?
67,Rachel,"Well, I haven't discussed it with him yet, but I know he's gonna be relieved."
68,Rachel,"Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book."
69,Ross,That's not really porn.
70,Rachel,Not so much.
71,Ross,"Hey, y'know what and if you're looking for a place?"
72,Ross,I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.
73,Rachel,Oh my God!
74,Rachel,Was she old?
75,Rachel,Does she have a view?
76,Ross,"Well I don't know, but how-how great would that be huh?"
77,Ross,You living in my building.
78,Ross,I could help take care of the baby.
79,Ross,I can come over whenever I want.
80,Ross,With your permission.
81,Rachel,Yeah that would really be great.
82,Ross,Yeah.
83,Rachel,Well can we see it?!
84,Rachel,Oh maybe we shouldn't.
85,Rachel,I mean if she just died this morning out of respect.
86,Ross,Yeah.
87,Ross,No.
88,Ross,No you're right.
89,Rachel,Shall we?
90,Ross,Yeah.
91,Ross,Hi.
92,Ross,I'm Ross Geller.
93,Ross,I live in the building.
94,Rachel,"And I'm Rachel, an admirer of the building."
95,Ross,I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I'm so sorry for your loss.
96,Ross,Mrs. Verhoeven's
97,Ross,What?
98,Ross,Mrs. Verhoeven's
99,Ross,"Oh, thank God!"
100,Ross,Mrs. Verhoeven's
101,Rachel,Ahh.
102,Rachel,Mrs. Verhoeven's
103,Ross,Of course!
104,Ross,"Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in  the laundry room."
105,Ross,Mrs. Verhoeven's
106,Ross,Y'know I would it's just painful.
107,Rachel,So she's really not dead.
108,Rachel,Mrs. Verhoeven's
109,Rachel,Hmm.
110,Rachel,"Do you thinkCould you tell me if she's hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two?"
111,Monica,"Oh well umm, I make it myself!"
112,Monica,It's two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice.
113,Monica,And now the secret ingredient isy'know what?
114,Monica,We just met.
115,Monica,I love her.
116,Monica,Okay.
117,Chandler,See?
118,Chandler,I told you.
119,Monica,She stole my jeans!
120,Chandler,What?
121,Monica,I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!
122,Chandler,So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?
123,Monica,Don't you see?
124,Monica,It's the perfect crime!
125,Chandler,She must've been planning this for years!
126,Monica,I will prove it to you!
127,Monica,Okay?
128,Monica,About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch.
129,Monica,Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!
130,Chandler,"Honey, isn't it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?"
131,Monica,I guess.
132,Chandler,"So, shouldn't we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we gosnooping around her crotch?"
133,Monica,Fine.
134,Monica,I'm just glad I didn't give her my secret ingredient.
135,Chandler,"Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?"
136,Monica,Yeah!
137,Phoebe,Hi!
138,Phoebe,"Yeah, me too."
139,Phoebe,Not in the shaky angry way you are though.
140,Phoebe,Oh.
141,Phoebe,Yeah.
142,Phoebe,Yeah.
143,Phoebe,Maybe this is too weird.
144,Phoebe,No don't tear out your eyes!
145,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah try that."
146,Phoebe,"So, is that better?"
147,Phoebe,"Look Eric, turn around."
148,Phoebe,"Look, I like you, but it shouldn't be this hard."
149,Phoebe,Y'know?
150,Phoebe,This is our first date y'know?
151,Phoebe,"First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and Ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand?'"
152,Phoebe,and y'know first kisses andsecond kisses.
153,Ross,"Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter."
154,Ross,"Yeah, we're done."
155,Ross,Ezel?
156,Ross,Ezel?
157,Ross,Ezel?
158,Joey,Hey Ross!
159,Joey,"Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?"
160,Ross,Really?
161,Joey,No.
162,Joey,"But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler."
163,Ross,Sweet!
164,Joey,"All right, well finish your coffee; let's go."
165,Ross,Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
166,Joey,To tape the game?
167,Joey,"You do this every time Ross, you're not gonna be on TV!"
168,Ross,"No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available."
169,Joey,"Oh, you're switching apartments?"
170,Ross,"It's not for me, it's for Rachel."
171,Joey,But Rachel has an apartment.
172,Ross,"Yeah, but when the baby comes she's gonna want to move."
173,Joey,She is?
174,Ross,"Yeah, you didn't expect her to live there with a baby did you?"
175,Joey,I guess I didn't really think about it.
176,Ross,Ezel!
177,Ross,Hey Gunther!
178,Ross,You're an ezel!
179,Ross,Damnit!
180,Monica,Nice jeans!
181,Monica,Oh.
182,Monica,You're not gettin' it.
183,Monica,"Oh, I fell asleep."
184,Monica,"Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets?"
185,Monica,That'll really work up your appetite for lunch.
186,Monica,Hello.
187,Monica,I'm sorry.
188,Monica,"I've never had a maid before, is this not okay?"
189,Monica,Commercial Break
190,Rachel,Hey!
191,Joey,Hey!
192,Rachel,How was the game?
193,Joey,"Oh, okay."
194,Joey,II ate way too much.
195,Rachel,Oh.
196,Joey,Ooh.
197,Joey,"So umm, I was talkin' to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place."
198,Rachel,Oh yeah!
199,Rachel,Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.
200,Joey,I was kinda hoping you'd stay.
201,Rachel,"Oh but Joey, I have to go."
202,Rachel,There's no room for a baby here.
203,Joey,No room?
204,Joey,It's a baby.
205,Joey,It's like this big.
206,Joey,"Y'know, I mean you-you could you could put it over here."
207,Joey,Or-or-or we could put it right here.
208,Joey,"Aw, it's cute, right?"
209,Joey,Or-or we could put it over here.
210,Joey,You wouldn't even notice it.
211,Joey,Where's the baby?
212,Rachel,"Honey, it's not just a matter of where you put it."
213,Rachel,I mean a baby changes everything.
214,Rachel,They cry all the time.
215,Rachel,I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there's a screaming baby around.
216,Joey,I could use a challenge!
217,Joey,It's getting pretty easy.
218,Rachel,"Honey, it's so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can't do that to you."
219,Rachel,I mean it would disrupt your entire life.
220,Joey,I love living with you so much.
221,Joey,I just wish things didn't have to change.
222,Rachel,I know.
223,Joey,Y'know I blame Ross for this.
224,Rachel,I do too a little bit.
225,Joey,"I'm gonna miss you, you're the hottest roommate I ever had."
226,Phoebe,"Ooh, oh no!"
227,Phoebe,I have to go!
228,Phoebe,I have a massage appointment.
229,Phoebe,"No, I got in trouble for that before."
230,Phoebe,I'll see you later.
231,Phoebe,Really?
232,Phoebe,That's the thing I'm worse at!
233,Phoebe,You'll see.
234,Chandler,Hi!
235,Monica,Hey!
236,Monica,"Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise."
237,Chandler,How come?
238,Monica,Because I put my head between her legs.
239,Chandler,To see her pants?
240,Monica,They're my pants!
241,Chandler,Are you sure?
242,Chandler,Did you see the stain?
243,Monica,No!
244,Monica,I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.
245,Chandler,God!
246,Chandler,She is not stealing from us!
247,Chandler,"Okay, will you let this go?"
248,Monica,Fine.
249,Monica,She's wearing my bra!
250,Chandler,Oh dear God!
251,Monica,My pink flowered bra!
252,Monica,I recognize the strap!
253,Chandler,And yet you don't recognize that you're crazy.
254,Monica,Here's the plan!
255,Monica,Okay?
256,Monica,I'm going to leave you get a look at Brenda's bra!
257,Chandler,Here's another planNo!
258,Monica,I would do it but she thinks I'm attracted to her!
259,Chandler,Why?
260,Monica,Did you not hear where my head was?
261,Monica,Come on!
262,Monica,Come on we're a team!
263,Monica,We're in this together!
264,Chandler,I fear a jury will see it the same way!
265,Monica,Do this for me!
266,Monica,"Come on, I catch you looking at woman's breasts all the time!"
267,Chandler,You see that?
268,Monica,Do you see this?
269,Chandler,All right.
270,Chandler,Yes.
271,Chandler,Okay.
272,Chandler,I get your point.
273,Chandler,But if it's not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?
274,Monica,Yes!
275,Monica,Absolutely.
276,Monica,Okay?
277,Monica,"Look, you'll know it's mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, there's a very noticeable rip."
278,Chandler,You need new clothes.
279,Ross,Hi.
280,Ross,How is she?
281,Ross,Mrs. Verhoeven's
282,Ross,Oh.
283,Ross,Oh.
284,Ross,"Well I uh, I brought her some bloemen."
285,Ross,Mrs. Verhoeven's
286,Ross,Oh I don't know that it would.
287,Ross,Mrs. Verhoeven's
288,Ross,All right then.
289,Phoebe,Hey!
290,Phoebe,Hey!
291,Phoebe,Can we pick up where we left off?
292,Phoebe,Why?
293,Phoebe,What sex?
294,Phoebe,We didn't have sex.
295,Phoebe,Ew!
296,Phoebe,Ew!
297,Phoebe,Ew!
298,Phoebe,Ew!
299,Phoebe,Ew!
300,Phoebe,Ew!
301,Phoebe,You-youyou had sex with Ursula?
302,Phoebe,You didn't notice she was wearing different clothes?
303,Phoebe,Oh.
304,Phoebe,Ew!
305,Phoebe,Ew!
306,Phoebe,Ew!
307,Phoebe,Ugh!
308,Phoebe,Y'know what?
309,Phoebe,This is too weird.
310,Phoebe,So I guess this is it.
311,Phoebe,"Yeah, so do you."
312,Chandler,I'm leaning.
313,Chandler,This is where I lean.
314,Chandler,Brenda a bee!
315,Chandler,Yes!
316,Chandler,It's flown into your blouse and you'd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
317,Chandler,You do?
318,Chandler,I totally understand.
319,Chandler,Can I just see your bra?
320,Rachel,Hi!
321,Monica,Where did you get those jeans?
322,Rachel,You gave them to me!
323,Monica,No I didn't!
324,Rachel,"All right, I took them."
325,Rachel,But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch.
326,Monica,Oh no!
327,Monica,Did you take my bra too?
328,Rachel,What bra?
329,Monica,The pink one with the flowers?
330,Rachel,You mean the one that you're wearing?
331,Monica,Sounds about right.
332,Rachel,What is this?
333,Joey,Hey!
334,Joey,"Uh, this is just to give you an idea."
335,Joey,"Okay well, we can put screens here,  so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobile over the crib."
336,Joey,And uhOh look!
337,Joey,"Here's a baby monitor , which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies."
338,Joey,Huh?
339,Rachel,You're so sweet.
340,Rachel,Oh my God!
341,Rachel,And you gave the baby Hugsy!
342,Joey,Ahhhhhhhhhhhh.
343,Joey,That-that-that's really just to show where the baby would go.
344,Joey,Y'know why don't I hold on to him so that there's no confusion?
345,Rachel,"But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it's going to be loud."
346,Joey,I'm loud!
347,Rachel,It's gonna be up all night!
348,Joey,I'm up all night!
349,Rachel,It's gonna poop!
350,Joey,Hello!
351,Rachel,What about all the women you want to bring home?
352,Joey,"Look, if I'm bringing home a woman who can't stand being around a baby, then maybe I don't want to be with that woman!"
353,Joey,Or maybe we'll just do it in the bathroom of the club!
354,Rachel,"Joey, are you sure?"
355,Joey,Yeah!
356,Joey,"All rightLook, I know sometimes it'll be hard, okay?"
357,Joey,"But, it'll also be reallyreally great."
358,Joey,Please Rachel!
359,Joey,I-I-I really want you to stay.
360,Rachel,I want me to stay too.
361,Joey,Ohh!

369,Joey,Yeah.
370,Rachel,Wow!
371,Rachel,Whoa-whoa what's under the covers?
372,Joey,I don't know.
373,Rachel,It's moving.
374,Joey,Ew.
375,Rachel,It's stillIt's got a tail!
376,Rachel,Get it out of here!

7,Rachel,"See, there's always one guy."
8,Rachel,"""If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."""
9,Monica,"Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?"

22,Phoebe,What what what!
23,Phoebe,...Hi.
24,Ross,"It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again."
25,Monica,What's going on with you?
26,Phoebe,I got no sleep last night!
27,Ross,Why?
28,Phoebe,"My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed."
29,Phoebe,"Oh, and deaf."
30,Phoebe,"So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time."
31,Phoebe,You have no idea how loud they are!
32,Monica,"Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight."
33,Phoebe,Thanks.

46,Chandler,"Well, aren't we Mr. ""The glass is half empty."""
47,Ross,"Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?"

106,Ross,"Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I..."
107,Ross,I walked her to the-  -the bus stop...
108,Ross,I'm fine.
109,Joey,"Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!"

140,Monica,Could you please tell me what this is in reference to?
141,Monica,"Yes, hold on."
142,Monica,"Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account."
143,Rachel,But I haven't used my card in weeks!
144,Monica,That is the unusual activity.

146,Rachel,They wanna know if I'm okay.
147,Rachel,"Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see."

149,Rachel,And it's not even for me!
150,Rachel,"So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?"
151,Monica,"Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?"
152,Rachel,"Alright, c'mon!"
153,Rachel,Let's play Twister!

160,Ross,"But now you mention it, there was ice there that night..."
161,Ross,It was the first frost...
162,Joey,"C'mon, sit."
163,Joey,"Just sit down, sit."
164,Monica,You should feel great about yourself!
165,Monica,You're doing this amazing independence thing!
166,Rachel,"Monica, what is so amazing?"
167,Rachel,"I gave up, like, everything."
168,Rachel,And for what?
169,Phoebe,You are just like Jack.
170,Rachel,...Jack from downstairs?
171,Phoebe,"No, Jack and the Beanstalk."
172,Monica,"Ah, the other Jack."
173,Phoebe,"Yeah, right!"
174,Phoebe,"See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans."
175,Phoebe,"And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village.."
176,Rachel,"Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist."
177,Rachel,"Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-"
178,Phoebe,"Oh, see, Jack did love the cow."
179,Rachel,"But see, it was a plan."
180,Rachel,"Y'know, it was clear."
181,Rachel,"It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like..."
182,Phoebe,Floopy?
183,Rachel,Yeah.
184,Monica,"So what, you're not the only one."
185,Monica,"I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going."
186,Monica,"You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy."
187,Phoebe,"Oh, like that's a word."
188,Rachel,"Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?"
189,Monica,...Pheebs?
190,Phoebe,"Oh, well... 'cause.... you just..."
191,Phoebe,I don't like this question.
192,Rachel,"Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans?"
193,Rachel,"I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?"
194,Ross,Get him!

207,Chandler,"Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room."
208,Ross,"Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright?"
209,Ross,My face is dented.
210,Joey,"Well, how long do you think it'll be?"
211,Ross,"Hey, this-  Heyy..."
212,Rachel,"I'm so sorry, you guys."
213,Rachel,I didn't mean to bring you down.

250,Rachel,"Oh, him, the little guy?"
251,Rachel,"Oh, I love him!"
252,Phoebe,"Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman."
253,Monica,Please tell me it's his mother.
254,Phoebe,Definitely not his mother.
255,Monica,"Oh, no..."
256,Phoebe,"Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza-  Hey, that's not for you, bitch!"
257,Chandler,"Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in."
258,Chandler,"I mean, that guy with the toe thing?"
259,Chandler,Who's he sleeping with?
260,Chandler,"Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad..."
261,Chandler,"I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other."
262,Chandler,"Y'know, I feel like I've lost her..  Ba-!"
263,Monica,Light still out?
264,Rachel,Yeah.
265,Monica,Oh.
266,Monica,Maybe they're- napping.
267,Rachel,"Oh please, they're having sex."
268,Rachel,Monica and
269,Phoebe,Shut up!
270,Rachel,"So, whaddya think George is like?"
271,Monica,I think he's shy.
272,Phoebe,Yeah?
273,Monica,Yeah.
274,Monica,I think you have to draw him out.
275,Monica,And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
276,Ross,I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
277,Chandler,"Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?"
278,Joey,"He's right, enough, already."
279,Joey,What is the big deal about today?
280,Joey,"So you slept with her for the first time, so what?"
281,Joey,You slept with her for seven years after that.
282,Ross,"Look, it's just a little more complicated..."
283,Chandler,"Well, what?"
284,Chandler,What?
285,Chandler,What is it?
286,Chandler,That she left you?
287,Chandler,That she likes women?
288,Chandler,That she left you for another woman that likes women?
289,Ross,"Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you..."
290,Chandler,Then what?
291,Ross,My first time with Carol was...
292,Joey,What?
293,Ross,It was my first time.
294,Joey,With Carol?
295,Joey,Oh.
296,Chandler,"So in your whole life, you've only been with oneoh."
297,Joey,"Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake!"
298,Joey,There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
299,Monica,Okay.
300,Monica,"Okay, I got one."
301,Monica,Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?
302,Phoebe,Uh-huh.
303,Monica,"Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!"
304,Phoebe,Oh!
305,Phoebe,Oh!
306,Phoebe,Oh!
307,Phoebe,"Okay, fine, fine."
308,Phoebe,Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
309,Monica,What?!
310,Monica,You slept with Jason?
311,Phoebe,You'd already broken up.
312,Rachel,How long?
313,Phoebe,A couple hours.
314,Monica,"Oh, that's nice!"
315,Rachel,"Okay, okay, okay, I got one!"
316,Rachel,Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.
317,Monica,Excuse me?
318,Rachel,Hello?
319,Rachel,Like he was really gonna send you one?
320,Rachel,She was a big girl.
321,Monica,Really.
322,Monica,"Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!"
323,Rachel,I was laughing!
324,Rachel,You made me laugh!
325,Phoebe,There he is!
326,Phoebe,There he is!
327,Monica,Where?
328,Phoebe,Right- where we've been looking all night!
329,Rachel,He is so cute!
330,Monica,"Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!"
331,Joey,Man.
332,Joey,Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
333,Chandler,I think it's great.
334,Chandler,"Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic..."
335,Joey,Really?
336,Chandler,"No, you kidding?"
337,Chandler,The guy's a freak..
338,Ross,Hi.
339,Chandler,"Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs."
340,Chandler,"Oh come on, admit it!"
341,Chandler,"All things considered, you had fun tonight."
342,Ross,Fun?
343,Ross,Where was the fun?
344,Ross,"Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part?"
345,Ross,Where's my puck?
346,Joey,"Oh, ah- the kid has it."
347,Ross,The kid...?
348,Ross,"Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck."
349,Chandler,"You gotta do it, man."
350,Ross,Oh yeah?
351,Ross,"Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatevercan't do it."
352,Ross,"Listen, uh- gimme back my puck."
353,Ross,"'Yes', how about."
354,Ross,C'mere.
355,Ross,Gimme!
356,Ross,GIVE ME MY PUCK!
357,Ross,...Now that was fun.
358,Ross,Closing Credits
359,Ross,"Okay,"
360,Monica,Right foot red.
361,Monica,"Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo."
362,Chandler,Thanks.
363,Ross,"Okay,"
364,Phoebe,Right hand blue.
365,Phoebe,Good.
366,Chandler,Hello?
367,Chandler,"Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people."
368,Rachel,"Oh, okay."
369,Rachel,Will you take my place?
370,Chandler,Alright.
371,Chandler,"Yes, this is Rachel."
372,Rachel,Nooo!
373,Rachel,Hello?
374,Rachel,"Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much."
375,Rachel,"Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really."
376,Ross,Green.
377,Ross,To the green.
378,Rachel,I've got magic beans.
379,Rachel,Never-never mind.
380,Chandler,"To the left, to the left- aww!"
381,Rachel,Ohhh...
382,Rachel,I'm fine.
383,Rachel,End
0,Chandler,I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked!
1,Chandler,It was like torture!
2,Ross,"Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise."
3,Chandler,It just keeps getting worse and worse!
4,Chandler,Y'know?
5,Chandler,"I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommates girlfriendwhich by the way, I think she knows."
6,Chandler,Because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us.
7,Chandler,"And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too."
8,Chandler,And now I have seen her naked.
9,Chandler,"I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something."
10,Chandler,"But there are no boles, she's smooth!"
11,Chandler,Smooth!
12,Phoebe,Wow!
13,Phoebe,Could everyone totally see up his robe?
14,Joey,Great!
15,Joey,"All right, so I'll call you later."
16,Chandler,Hey-Hey-Hey!
17,Chandler,Who was that?
18,Joey,That would be Casey.
19,Joey,We're going out tonight.
20,Chandler,"Goin' out, huh?"
21,Chandler,Wow!
22,Chandler,Wow!
23,Chandler,"So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh?"
24,Chandler,Bummer.
25,Joey,"No, things are fine with Kathy."
26,Joey,"I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey."
27,Chandler,What?
28,Joey,Yeah-yeah.
29,Joey,And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
30,Chandler,Wait!
31,Chandler,You're going out with Kathy!
32,Joey,Yeah.
33,Joey,Why are you getting so upset?
34,Chandler,"Well, I'm upsetfor you."
35,Chandler,"I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you."
36,Joey,What is the big deal?
37,Joey,It's not like we're exclusive.
38,Chandler,"Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs."
39,Chandler,"But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you."
40,Joey,You got all that from the back of her head?
41,Chandler,"All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down."
42,Chandler,Y'know?
43,Chandler,"Make a choice, pick a lane."
44,Joey,Who's Elaine?
45,Phoebe,"""Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair."
46,Phoebe,"Swinging with the greatest of ease"" Darn it!"
47,Phoebe,"Now, I don't know who to get to the next verse."
48,Ross,"Oh, you could just go uh, ""greatest of ease  BAH-bah-bha-bhannn."""
49,Ross,Then go right into it.
50,Phoebe,"Yeah, ooh, I like that!"
51,Phoebe,Yeah.
52,Phoebe,Wait!
53,Phoebe,How do you know about bah-bah-bha-bhan?'
54,Ross,"Well umm, y'know, I used to play."
55,Phoebe,"Oh yeah, that's right, the keyboards, huh?"
56,Ross,"Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college."
57,Ross,I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound.
58,Monica,Oh God!
59,Monica,"Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it."
60,Monica,"Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound."
61,Ross,Yeah.
62,Monica,He used to lock himself in the basement for hours.
63,Monica,"No one was every allowed to hear, ""The Sound."""
64,Phoebe,"I wanna hear ""The Sound."""
65,Ross,Really?
66,Ross,No.
67,Ross,"I mean, nah, I haven't played in so long, and-and, well it's-it's really personal stuff, y'know?"
68,Phoebe,"Come on, play that funky music white boy."
69,Monica,Yeah!
70,Ross,"No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up inNo, yeah, okay."
71,Ross,"Okay, guys."
72,Chandler,All right!
73,Chandler,"Bring it on, you"
74,Ross,Here we go.
75,Ross,"Y'know, I've-I've never played my stuff for anyone before, so it's important that-that you understand it's about communicating very private emotions."
76,Ross,"Y'know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems."
77,Ross,That's what I'm
78,Chandler,Oh my God!
79,Chandler,Play!
80,Monica,"Boy, that was-that was, umm terrific."
81,Chandler,"Really, bitchin'!"
82,Phoebe,"Wow, it was sowow!"
83,Ross,Really?!
84,Ross,"I mean, really?!"
85,Rachel,"Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!"
86,Ross,Wow!
87,Ross,"Thanks, you guys."
88,Ross,"That's uhohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece!"
89,Ross,Umm!
90,Ross,Uh-oh!
91,Ross,"I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk."
92,Ross,I'll be right back!
93,Ross,Okay?
94,Ross,"This is so nice, I'mI am so"
95,Monica,Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
96,Rachel,"Oh, I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers."
97,Phoebe,"What are you guys talking about, I loved it!"
98,Phoebe,It was soo moving.
99,Phoebe,"Oh, plus it's just, it's so different from the stuff you usually hear."
100,Chandler,"You mean like, music?"
101,Chandler,"Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'!"
102,Chandler,"Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy."
103,Chandler,Come in!
104,Chandler,"Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles."
105,Chandler,"No-no, he's not back yet, but he'll be here any minute."
106,Chandler,"So uh, come on in."
107,Chandler,Have a seat.
108,Chandler,Bow or stern?
109,Chandler,I like it in the stern.
110,Chandler,of the boat.
111,Chandler,Hello.
112,Joey,"Hey, it's me."
113,Joey,Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
114,Chandler,What happened?
115,Joey,"We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid."
116,Joey,"And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I'll be there as soon as I can."
117,Chandler,Why can't you tell her?
118,Joey,"Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to"
119,Chandler,Joey!
120,Chandler,Joey!
121,Joey,Yeah?
122,Chandler,I thought your time ran out.
123,Joey,"Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more"
124,Chandler,"Uhh, that was Joey."
125,Chandler,"He's running a little late, he says he's sorry."
126,Chandler,"So I guess it's just uh, you and me then."
127,Chandler,"Yeah, I think it is!"
128,Chandler,"Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut"
129,Chandler,and then it got canceled.
130,Chandler,Really?!
131,Chandler,You do that?
132,Chandler,Dog grooming huh?
133,Chandler,"Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy."
134,Chandler,"Well, thanks."
135,Chandler,I grow it myself.
136,Chandler,Y'know who also has great hair is Joey!
137,Chandler,What-what cha doin'?
138,Chandler,Kay.
139,Chandler,Oh the phone!
140,Chandler,The phone's making sounds!
141,Chandler,Hello!
142,Joey,"Hey dude, it's me."
143,Chandler,Hey it's Joey!
144,Joey,"Listen uh, I'm really sorry, it looks like I'm gonna be stuck here for a while."
145,Joey,"I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn't there!"
146,Chandler,What?
147,Joey,"Yeah, it must've fallen out a few blocks back."
148,Joey,I just figured we hit a dog.
149,Chandler,Okay.
150,Joey,"Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize."
151,Chandler,Oh yeah man.
152,Chandler,Joey.
153,Chandler,Yeah.
154,Chandler,Yes!
155,Chandler,Yeah.
156,Chandler,Oh.
157,Chandler,"No-no-no-no, this is bad!"
158,Chandler,It's bad!
159,Chandler,This is bad!
160,Chandler,"Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?"
161,Chandler,Okay!
162,Chandler,Ooh!
163,Chandler,Yes!
164,Chandler,Okay!
165,Chandler,"Here's what we do, we-we forget it happened."
166,Chandler,"Okay, we-we swallow our feelings."
167,Chandler,Even if it means we're unhappy forever.
168,Chandler,Sound good?
169,Chandler,"I have to; he's my best friend, and you're seeing him."
170,Chandler,Oh-no-no-no!
171,Chandler,Don't!
172,Chandler,Don't!
173,Chandler,"See-see, you're getting me confused, I'm starting to urn."
174,Chandler,I-I think we have too.
175,Chandler,Bye.
176,Chandler,Are you still out there?
177,Ross,Electrifying.
178,Ross,Emphatic time-time-time
179,Monica,"Y'know, there's a Starbucks about three blocks down."
180,Phoebe,It's so inspired!
181,Phoebe,Look at him!
182,Phoebe,Look at him go!
183,Ross,Thank you guys-guys-guys
184,Monica,"Hey, aren't you up next?"
185,Phoebe,"Oh no, I'm not playing tonight."
186,Rachel,Why not?
187,Phoebe,I can't follow Ross!
188,Phoebe,It'd be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles.
189,Phoebe,No.
190,Monica,"Phoebe, Ross sucks!"
191,Rachel,"Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him."
192,Phoebe,"Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time."
193,Phoebe,I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
194,Monica,Okay.
195,Monica,"Umm, Phoebe, you suck too."
196,Rachel,"Yeah, Phoebe you're awful!"
197,Phoebe,You guys.
198,Phoebe,You suck too.
199,Joey,Aww man!
200,Joey,I can't believe I locked myself out again!
201,Chandler,Hang on buddy!
202,Joey,Oh my God!
203,Joey,What happened here?
204,Joey,Did you do all this?
205,Chandler,I sure did.
206,Joey,Why?
207,Chandler,"Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend."
208,Joey,"Well, you're amazing."
209,Chandler,Oh no-no-no.
210,Chandler,This is amazing.
211,Joey,A TV as if it appears from nowhere!
212,Joey,That's the dream!
213,Joey,"Man, how did you afford this stuff?"
214,Chandler,"Well, y'know I'm 29."
215,Chandler,I mean who needs a savings account.
216,Joey,"Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had."
217,Chandler,"Oh, I don't know."
218,Joey,"Oh-no-no-no, you are!"
219,Joey,"You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that."
220,Chandler,You mean with Casey.
221,Joey,"No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy."
222,Joey,She's pretty cool.
223,Chandler,Or Casey.
224,Joey,"No-no, Kathy."
225,Chandler,Could be Casey.
226,Joey,No.
227,Joey,"No, Kathy."
228,Chandler,Consider Casey.
229,Joey,Y'know what I think?
230,Joey,I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey.
231,Joey,How bout I fix you two up?
232,Joey,What do you think?
233,Chandler,That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
234,Ross,Hey!
235,Phoebe,Hey!
236,Phoebe,You were really great!
237,Phoebe,"You were really, really great!"
238,Ross,"Oh, thanks, thanks."
239,Ross,"So Monica tells me that uh, you don't want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent."
240,Ross,Is that true?
241,Phoebe,"Well, kinda."
242,Phoebe,Yeah.
243,Phoebe,Yeah.
244,Ross,Pheebs
245,Phoebe,"Yeah, I-I can'tI mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I justI feel so dwarfed by your musical gift."
246,Ross,"See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music."
247,Ross,"Y'know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I I won't play anymore."
248,Phoebe,Oh no.
249,Phoebe,"No-no-no, don't do that!"
250,Phoebe,How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.
251,Ross,"Yeah, okay."
252,Ross,Hey Chandler!
253,Ross,Saw the new furniture.
254,Ross,Very nice.
255,Monica,Yeah!
256,Monica,Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
257,Chandler,I kissed Kathy.
258,Ross,What?
259,Monica,Are you serious?
260,Phoebe,Does Joey know?
261,Chandler,No.
262,Chandler,"Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?"
263,Monica,You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends.
264,Monica,Which we all appreciate.
265,Ross,"No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside."
266,Chandler,"Oh, don't say that!"
267,Chandler,Don't say that.
268,Chandler,That's not true.
269,Chandler,Is it?
270,Phoebe,"I think maybe, yeah."
271,Monica,He loves you.
272,Chandler,Then why didn't you tell me to do that?!
273,Ross,"Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe."
274,Phoebe,Yeah!
275,Phoebe,"No, that's right."
276,Phoebe,And I thought it was a really good idea.
277,Rachel,"I know, I remember that!"
278,Monica,I remember you did.
279,Chandler,God!!
280,Chandler,What am I gonna do?
281,Rachel,"Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him."
282,Chandler,Why?!
283,Chandler,Why do I have to tell him?
284,Rachel,Because you do.
285,Chandler,"Yeah, I know."
286,Ross,"Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this."
287,Chandler,Hey!
288,Joey,Hey!
289,Joey,Samboucha Margarita?
290,Chandler,Is that a real thing?
291,Joey,"Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now."
292,Chandler,"Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something."
293,Joey,What's up?
294,Chandler,It's-it's about Kathy.
295,Chandler,"Umm, uh, I like her."
296,Chandler,I like her a lot actually.
297,Joey,You do?
298,Chandler,Yeah.
299,Joey,"Well, you're timing couldn't be better."
300,Joey,She's not my girlfriend anymore.
301,Chandler,What?
302,Joey,"Yeah, she broke up with me."
303,Chandler,"Oh uh, when?"
304,Joey,"Just now, after acting class."
305,Joey,"At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch."
306,Chandler,"Oh man, I am so sorry."
307,Chandler,"Are, are you okay?"
308,Joey,"Well, I've been better."
309,Joey,"But, I'm all right."
310,Joey,So you like her huh?
311,Chandler,"Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too."
312,Joey,"No-no-no, no it's uh, it's okay."
313,Chandler,Yeah?
314,Joey,Yeah.
315,Joey,You know why?
316,Joey,Cause you came to me first.
317,Chandler,"Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do."
318,Joey,"But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you're work cut out for you."
319,Joey,"Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she's into some other guy."
320,Joey,So
321,Chandler,"See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about."
322,Chandler,I-I think I know who the other guy is.
323,Joey,Who?
324,Chandler,It's me.
325,Chandler,I'm the other guy.
326,Joey,What?
327,Chandler,"Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and"
328,Joey,And what?!
329,Joey,Did you sleep with her?
330,Chandler,No!
331,Chandler,No!
332,Chandler,No!
333,Chandler,I just kissed her.
334,Joey,What?!!
335,Joey,That's even worse!
336,Chandler,How is that worse?
337,Joey,I don't know!
338,Joey,But it's the same!
339,Chandler,"Look, I'm sorry!"
340,Chandler,"But there's nothing I can do, I think I'm in love with her!"
341,Joey,Who cares?!
342,Joey,You went behind my back!
343,Joey,I would never do that to you!
344,Chandler,"You're right, I have no excuses!"
345,Chandler,I was totally over the line.
346,Joey,Over the line?!
347,Joey,"You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line!"
348,Joey,The line is a dot to you!
349,Chandler,Yes.
350,Chandler,Yes!
351,Chandler,Right!
352,Chandler,And I feel horrible.
353,Chandler,You have to believe me!
354,Joey,Is that why you bought all this stuff?!
355,Joey,"Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat!"
356,Joey,You know why?
357,Chandler,Probably because
358,Joey,Because it's all tainted with your betrayal.
359,Joey,From now on this apartment is empty for me!
360,Joey,And I'm not happy about you either.
361,Joey,"Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you."
362,Joey,Closing Credits
363,Phoebe,"Oh my God, he's lost it."
364,Phoebe,He's totally lost it.
365,Monica,What?
366,Rachel,"Phoebe, his music could not get any worse."
367,Rachel,There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
368,Ross,"Thank you, thanks."
369,Ross,"Yeah, I lost it."
370,Ross,"Y'know, I'm not gonna play anymore,  would you, can you finish my set?"
371,Phoebe,After that?
372,Phoebe,Yeah!
373,Phoebe,"No, I mean if I can help."
374,Ross,"Yeah, like I could lose it."
375,Rachel,What?
376,Ross,I played bad on purpose guys.
377,Monica,"Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time."
378,Ross,"Yeahno, just that last song."
379,Ross,End
0,Chandler,"No-no-no-no, we're done."
1,Chandler,Opening Credits
2,Monica,"Aunt Syl, stop yelling!"
3,Monica,"All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna."
4,Monica,"Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape."
5,Joey,"Ross, did you really read all these baby books?"
6,Ross,Yup!
7,Ross,"You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!"
8,Phoebe,"Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta."
9,Chandler,"And, we're done with the yogurt."
10,Phoebe,Sorry.
11,Monica,"Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer."
12,Monica,What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas?
13,Monica,"Nice talk, Aunt Syl."
14,Monica,You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
15,Joey,"Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big?"
16,Joey,This is your baby.
17,Joey,Hi Daddy!
18,Ross,Hello!
19,Joey,How come you don't live with Mommy?
20,Joey,How come Mommy lives with that other lady?
21,Joey,What's a lesbian?
22,Rachel,"Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos"
23,Ross,"Mma, Mma, Mmaah"
24,Monica,"So, did I hear Poconos?"
25,Rachel,"Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend."
26,Phoebe,"Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!"
27,Monica,"Yeah, that's a big step."
28,Rachel,I know...
29,Chandler,"Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!"
30,Ross,"Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh?"
31,Ross,Shouldn't it be... flung by now?
32,Rachel,"I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know?"
33,Rachel,"I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally..."
34,Ross,"...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous."
35,Ross,"What am I supposed to do, huh?"
36,Ross,Call immigration?
37,Ross,I could call immigration!
38,Joey,"I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands..."
39,Chandler,"Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!"
40,Joey,Need a new table.
41,Chandler,You think?
42,Ross,"Hey, hello!"
43,Ross,mmwa!
44,Ross,"I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna."
45,Ross,I'm pretty sure that it is...
46,Ross,"Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?"
47,Ross,"Oh, that's great, that is great!"
48,Ross,"Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?"
49,Ross,Of course it's your friend Tanya.
50,Ross,The sex?
51,Ross,"Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya , yaw..."
52,Ross,"Oh, you know the sex of the baby?"
53,Ross,"Oh, oh-oh-oh!"
54,Ross,"No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not."
55,Ross,"I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is!"
56,Ross,Or isn't...
57,Ross,Susan...
58,Ross,"Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!"
59,Ross,"Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!"
60,Ross,"Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?"
61,Ross,Carol and
62,Ross,"No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to know."
63,Ross,"Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go."
64,Ross,"No problem, ok, mmmwa  oh, mmmwa  Susan..."
65,Ross,"Uh, never mind, I don't want to know."
66,Chandler,"Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?"
67,Joey,That's the rule.
68,Chandler,What rule?
69,Chandler,"There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!"
70,Joey,How'd you get to that?
71,Chandler,"Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio"
72,Joey,You knew about that?
73,Chandler,"Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination."
74,Joey,"Ok, ok, How about if we split it?"
75,Chandler,"What do you mean, like, buy it together?"
76,Joey,Yeah
77,Chandler,You think we're ready for something like that?
78,Joey,Why not?
79,Chandler,"Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?"
80,Joey,"Why, are you moving out?"
81,Chandler,I'm not moving out.
82,Joey,You'd tell me if you were moving out right
83,Chandler,"Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip..."
84,Joey,"Aw, I know all about Kip!"
85,Chandler,"It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly."
86,Joey,"Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?"
87,Chandler,"Aw, don't do that"
88,Phoebe,"Ok, thanks."
89,Phoebe,Phoebe's
90,Phoebe,"Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?"
91,Phoebe,"Well, Racquela's right, yeah!"
92,Phoebe,"Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started."
93,Phoebe,"Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops!"
94,Phoebe,You're being naked!
95,Rachel,I can't believe you don't want to know.
96,Rachel,"I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows...."
97,Monica,And Monica knows...
98,Ross,"Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!"
99,Monica,"Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me."
100,Joey,So what's it gonna be?
101,Ross,"Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!"
102,Monica,"I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!"
103,Joey,Or an uncle...   Joey and
104,Chandler,Hey Phoebe!
105,Ross,Hi Pheebs!
106,Rachel,Pheebs!
107,Phoebe,Fine!
108,Monica,"Phoebe, what's the matter?"
109,Phoebe,"Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts."
110,Rachel,"Oh, right, that's me!"
111,Joey,"Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on."
112,Chandler,Fine.
113,Monica,"Phoebe, what is it?"
114,Phoebe,"All right, you know Paolo?"
115,Ross,"I'm familiar with his work, yes..."
116,Phoebe,"Well, he made a move on me."
117,Joey,"Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!"
118,Chandler,"More coffee over here, please!"
119,Chandler,Commercial Break
120,Monica,"Well, what happened?"
121,Phoebe,"Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until."
122,Phoebe,Joey and
123,Chandler,Ooooohh!
124,Ross,My God.
125,Monica,Are you sure?
126,Phoebe,"Oh yeah, I'm sure."
127,Phoebe,And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
128,Phoebe,(Flashback
129,Monica,Was it...?
130,Phoebe,"Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there."
131,Rachel,"""Ooo,"" what?"
132,Phoebe,Uma Thurman.
133,Monica,Oh!
134,Ross,The actress!
135,Ross,Thanks Rach.
136,Chandler,So what are you gonna do?
137,Ross,You have to tell her!
138,Ross,You have to tell her!
139,Ross,"It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue!"
140,Ross,Guys?
141,Ross,Guys?
142,Chandler,"Oh, yeah, you have to tell her."
143,Joey,Feminist issue.
144,Joey,That's where I went!
145,Phoebe,She is gonna hate me.
146,Joey,"Will you pick one, just pick one!"
147,Joey,"Here, how about that one?"
148,Chandler,That's patio furniture!
149,Joey,"So what, like people are gonna come in and think, ""Uh-oh, I'm outside again?"""
150,Joey,Of course!
151,Chandler,What about the birds?
152,Joey,"I don't know, birds just don't say, ""Hello, sit here, eat something."""
153,Chandler,You pick one.
154,Joey,"All right, how about the ladybugs?"
155,Chandler,"Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!"
156,Joey,"Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!"
157,Chandler,"Not like that, I won't!"
158,Chandler,Kip would have liked the birds!
159,Phoebe,Hey!
160,Rachel,Hi Pheebs!
161,Phoebe,Are you moving out?
162,Rachel,"No, these aren't all my suitcases."
163,Rachel,This one's Paolo's.
164,Phoebe,"Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?"
165,Rachel,"Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over."
166,Phoebe,Oh!
167,Phoebe,"Ok, um, ok, um,"
168,Rachel,"Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs..."
169,Phoebe,"Ok, um,  we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me."
170,Phoebe,"One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world."
171,Rachel,"Ok, thanks Pheebs  Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?"
172,Phoebe,"Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies"
173,Rachel,"All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had."
174,Phoebe,Which proves that I never lie.
175,Rachel,I guess you don't.
176,Phoebe,Paolo made a pass at me.
177,Chandler,"So, what do you think?"
178,Ross,I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
179,Chandler,I know!
180,Monica,"So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?"
181,Joey,"Who cares, we'll eat at the sink!"
182,Joey,"Come on, let's play!"
183,Monica,Heads up Ross!
184,Monica,Score!
185,Monica,You suck!
186,Phoebe,Are you okay?
187,Rachel,I need some milk.
188,Phoebe,"Ok, I've got milk  Here you go...  Oh!"
189,Phoebe,Better?
190,Rachel,"No...oh, I feel so stupid!"
191,Rachel,"Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all ""Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..."" Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!"
192,Phoebe,"I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!"
193,Rachel,"Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!"
194,Rachel,Rachel and
195,Phoebe,I'm so sorry!
196,Phoebe,No I'm sorry!
197,Phoebe,No I'm sorry!
198,Phoebe,No I'm sorry!
199,Phoebe,"No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?"
200,Rachel,"I don't know...right, he's the pig!"
201,Phoebe,Such a pig!
202,Rachel,"Oh, God, he's such a pig,"
203,Phoebe,Oh he's like a...
204,Rachel,He's like a big disgusting...
205,Phoebe,...like a...
206,Rachel,...pig...pig man!
207,Phoebe,"Yes, good!"
208,Phoebe,Ok...
209,Rachel,"Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?"
210,Phoebe,Oh!
211,Phoebe,I know!
212,Phoebe,"It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you..."
213,Rachel,"Ok, Ok, Pheebs..."
214,Phoebe,The end.
215,Rachel,"Oh, God..."
216,Phoebe,Should I not have told you?
217,Rachel,"No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know."
218,Rachel,"Uh, I just liked it better before it was better..."
219,Phoebe,I think she took it pretty well.
220,Phoebe,"You know Paolo's over there right now, so..."
221,Monica,We should get over there and see if she's okay.
222,Monica,Just one...second!
223,Monica,Score!
224,Monica,Game!
225,Monica,Come on.
226,Ross,Ah...ooh!
227,Ross,"Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts."
228,Joey,"No-no, she kicked our butts."
229,Joey,You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
230,Ross,"Come on, two on one."
231,Chandler,What are you still doing here?
232,Chandler,"She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!"
233,Ross,"What, now?"
234,Joey,"Yes, now is when you swoop!"
235,Joey,"You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not!"
236,Joey,"You're like, like the anti-Paolo!"
237,Chandler,My Catholic friend is right.
238,Chandler,She's distraught.
239,Chandler,You're there for her.
240,Chandler,"You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!"
241,Ross,How's it going?
242,Monica,Don't stare.
243,Monica,"Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, ""How could you?"""
244,Monica,"or, ""Enormous breasts!"""
245,Monica,Here he comes!
246,Phoebe,Ooh!
247,Phoebe,"Oh, ok bye-bye."
248,Monica,"Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel,  but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles."
249,Ross,"Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say..."
250,Phoebe,"Oh, just look at her..."
251,Ross,"Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed..."
252,Monica,"Oh, you're right."
253,Ross,...and I really think it should be me.
254,Ross,Hey.
255,Rachel,Hey.
256,Ross,You all right?
257,Rachel,"Ooh, I've been better..."
258,Ross,Come here.
259,Ross,"Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you."
260,Rachel,"Oh, Ross..."
261,Ross,What?
262,Rachel,I am so sick of guys.
263,Rachel,"I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy."
264,Ross,Huh.
265,Rachel,"Oh Ross, you're so great!"
266,Ross,Ohhhh
267,Monica,"Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?"
268,Rachel,Oh...
269,Phoebe,You ok?
270,Rachel,...medium...hmm...any cookies left?
271,Phoebe,Yep!
272,Ross,"See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer."
273,Ross,I really don't.
274,Ross,I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
275,Rachel,No.
276,Rachel,"I just need to be by myself for a while, you know?"
277,Rachel,I just got to figure out what I want
278,Ross,"Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo."
279,Rachel,"No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one."
280,Ross,What?
281,Rachel,What?
282,Ross,"I-I'm, I'm having a boy?"
283,Rachel,Uh...no.
284,Rachel,"No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy."
285,Ross,"Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy!"
286,Ross,"Huh, am I having a boy?"
287,Ross,I'm having a boy!
288,Ross,"Oh, I'm having a boy!"
289,Chandler,Wha-
290,Joey,Wha- Joey and
291,Chandler,What is it?
292,Ross,I'm having a boy!
293,Ross,I-I'm having a boy!
294,Joey,Hey!
295,Chandler,Hey!
296,Chandler,Joey and
297,Chandler,We already knew that!
298,Ross,I'm having a son.
299,Ross,Um...
300,Ross,Closing Credits
301,Monica,Yes!
302,Monica,And that would be a shut-down!
303,Monica,Joey and
304,Chandler,Shut-out!
305,Monica,Where are you guys going?
306,Monica,"Come on, one more game!"
307,Joey,"Uh, it's"
308,Chandler,"Yeah, get out!"
309,Monica,You guys are always hanging out in my apartment!
310,Monica,"Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh?"
311,Monica,"Come on, wussies!"
312,Monica,"All right, ok, I gotta go."
313,Monica,"I'm going,  and I'm gone."
314,Chandler,One more game?
315,Joey,Oh yeah!
316,Joey,End
0,Rachel,Phoebe?
1,Phoebe,Yeah?
2,Rachel,"Look at that guy by the window, wow!"
3,Phoebe,He's awfully short and I think he's talking to himself.
4,Phoebe,"And to  be completely honest, he's not that good in bed."
5,Rachel,"Oh, what is wrong with me lately?"
6,Rachel,I mean it's like every guy I  seeI mean look here.
7,Rachel,"Look at that guy for example, I mean  normally that's not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the  way I'm feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack."
8,Phoebe,Wait a second!
9,Phoebe,"This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?"
10,Rachel,Yeah.
11,Phoebe,"This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start  going crazy."
12,Rachel,Really?!
13,Rachel,So this has happened to you?
14,Phoebe,Oh absolutely yeah!
15,Phoebe,"Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so  in, y'know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy."
16,Rachel,Wow!
17,Rachel,This explains so much!
18,Rachel,"Last weekend, I went from store to store  sitting on Santa's lap."
19,Phoebe,Yeah.
20,Phoebe,"Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander  Holyfield from a Foot Locker."
21,Rachel,Ah.
22,Phoebe,Yeah.
23,Rachel,"Well, y'know what?"
24,Rachel,"I go see my doctor tomorrow, I'll ask her  about this."
25,Rachel,Maybe she can give me a pill or something.
26,Phoebe,Yeah.
27,Phoebe,"Yeah, that's what you need a goodpill."
28,Phoebe,Opening Credits
29,Ross,Hi!
30,Ross,Oh great!
31,Ross,"Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona  ice skating?"
32,Joey,"Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now."
33,Ross,Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us  together?
34,Joey,I'm missin' picture time?
35,Phoebe,Y'know she has a face Ross!
36,Ross,Wow!
37,Ross,That is a good one!
38,Ross,"Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card  y'know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow."
39,Ross,Together?
40,Ross,Like-like to people?
41,Ross,Okay.
42,Ross,"Uh sure, sure."
43,Phoebe,Bye.
44,Joey,Congratulations!
45,Joey,You just got married!
46,Ross,I know.
47,Ross,Can you believe that?
48,Phoebe,"Wait, I'm-I'm sorry."
49,Phoebe,What's the big deal about a holiday  card?
50,Ross,"Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have  been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards!"
51,Ross,What-what is she crazy?
52,Joey,"Hey-hey-hey, hey that's your wife you're talking about!"
53,Chandler,"Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?"
54,Monica,"Yes, hi."
55,Chandler,"I didn't know you and Carol were getting divorced, I'm  sorry."
56,Monica,No leg-chewing for us sir.
57,Monica,I can't think of anything we're doing.
58,Monica,Why  can't I think of anything we're doing?
59,Monica,"Okay, I'll see you tomorrow!"
60,Monica,"Just so you know,  we're not seeing him tomorrow."
61,Monica,I-I cannot spend another  evening with that man.
62,Monica,Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
63,Chandler,No.
64,Monica,That's because he wasn't invited because of the way he behaved  at our engagement party.
65,Chandler,Oh yeah.
66,Chandler,"Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture  doesn't it?"
67,Ross,Hey!
68,Ross,Huh.
69,Ross,"Wow, this is great."
70,Ross,"Well, we-we haven't said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay  to say it to other people."
71,Ross,A hundred?!
72,Ross,"Well, I-I guess I'll take aMona, uhI-I'm  not sure about the whole uh, card thing."
73,Ross,"Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don't know if  we're really quite there yet."
74,Ross,Yeah.
75,Ross,Huh.
76,Ross,Hmm
77,Ross,Let's do the card!
78,Ross,The card!
79,Ross,I think we're there!
80,Ross,Really?!
81,Ross,"I mean, even with the card?"
82,Rachel,Hi!
83,Rachel,"Oh, okay."
84,Rachel,"Hey, can I ask you a question?"
85,Rachel,"Was it me, or-or was the guy  who took my blood sample really cute?"
86,Rachel,"Y'know who I'm talking about, bald  haircut, hairy fingers  Dr."
87,Rachel,"Yes, you are."
88,Rachel,Dr.
89,Rachel,"Oh, really, really good."
90,Rachel,"But enough about me, come on!"
91,Rachel,Where-where are  you from?
92,Rachel,What do you do?
93,Rachel,Dr.
94,Rachel,Right!
95,Rachel,Right!
96,Rachel,"I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook?"
97,Rachel,Do you  ski?
98,Rachel,Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?
99,Rachel,Dr.
100,Rachel,"Oh, I love to ski!"
101,Rachel,How amazing is this?!
102,Rachel,Dr.
103,Rachel,No.
104,Rachel,I'm very comfortable.
105,Rachel,Dr.
106,Rachel,No!
107,Rachel,"Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!"
108,Rachel,Dr.
109,Rachel,Well would you like me to lie down on the table?
110,Rachel,Dr.
111,Rachel,Do you feel it too?
112,Rachel,Hi.
113,Phoebe,Oh hey!
114,Phoebe,"So, how did your doctor's appointment go?"
115,Rachel,"Well, let's see."
116,Rachel,"Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the  middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple."
117,Phoebe,Oh my God.
118,Monica,Why did you do that?
119,Phoebe,"Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my  fourth month of  pregnancy?"
120,Monica,"Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase."
121,Monica,Oh man you were so hard up you  practically came on to me.
122,Phoebe,You wish.
123,Monica,"Hey, I could've had you if I wanted you."
124,Phoebe,Oh yeah?
125,Phoebe,Come and get it.
126,Rachel,"Okay, even this is turning me on!"
127,Ross,Hey!
128,Rachel,Oh hey!
129,Rachel,Hey Ross!
130,Rachel,"Hey how's it, how's it going with you and  Mona?"
131,Rachel,Are you guys still together?
132,Ross,"Oh yeah, yeah we're moving forward."
133,Ross,You'll be getting our card!
134,Monica,You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?
135,Ross,"Yeah, we're not just doing a card!"
136,Ross,"Y'know, she-she also wants to  have the conversation about where the relationship is going."
137,Phoebe,Ugh!
138,Phoebe,Women!
139,Ross,I know!
140,Ross,I know!
141,Ross,Why do you guys need to have this conversation?!
142,Ross,Huh?
143,Ross,"I  mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, ""So, where is this going?"""
144,Rachel,Uh Ross?
145,Rachel,You asked me that.
146,Ross,Hey!
147,Ross,You were a closed book!
148,Ross,Okay?
149,Ross,I'm not a mind reader!
150,Ross,"Besides, I  hate those conversations."
151,Ross,I'm horrible at them.
152,Ross,Really!
153,Ross,Maybe-maybe I need kind of a  gesture.
154,Ross,"Y'know, something that says we're moving forward without having to talk  about it."
155,Monica,Like asking her to move in with you?
156,Ross,Smaller than that.
157,Monica,Making her a mixed tape?
158,Ross,"Uh, bigger than that."
159,Phoebe,Give her a key to your apartment.
160,Ross,Whoa-hello!
161,Ross,We were closer with the mixed tape.
162,Monica,All right.
163,Monica,"Have you said, ""I love you?"""
164,Monica,"You could say, I love  you."
165,Ross,"Yeah I-I don't-I don't think I'm quite there yet, but I  could say I looove spending time with you."
166,Phoebe,"No, we hate that."
167,Monica,That is a slap in the face.
168,Ross,Forget it.
169,Ross,I-IY'know what?
170,Ross,I'll just have the  conversation.
171,Ross,"I'll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best."
172,Ross,What do you think Rach?
173,Rachel,"I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples  through that sweater."
174,Chandler,"Oh uh, as it turns out, we can't do it."
175,Chandler,Monica has to work.
176,Chandler,Oh uh well tomorrow's no good for her either.
177,Chandler,It's the semi-finalsof herbotchy ball tournament.
178,Chandler,Well now-now you're just talking crazy.
179,Chandler,Because uhwe-wewe split up.
180,Chandler,Monica and I split up.
181,Chandler,Hold  me.
182,Chandler,Y'know what would really help me through this tough time is  choking something.
183,Chandler,Can I choke ya?
184,Chandler,"Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak."
185,Chandler,But to hell with  that bitch.
186,Ross,Here we go.
187,Ross,"Mona umm, I think it's time we-we had a conversation  about-about where things are with us."
188,Ross,"Aw, we-we are so So umm, well  I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y'know hanging out with you."
189,Ross,And I mean-I'm  having a lot of fun.
190,Ross,"I mean, there's no point in spending time with someone if-if  it's just fun."
191,Ross,"It's gotta be, it's gotta be going somewhere right?"
192,Ross,So  where-where is it going?
193,Ross,Ah!
194,Ross,That's-that's the real question.
195,Ross,And-and  the answer isis it's going somewherefun.
196,Ross,"Now I-I know what you're  thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y'know, but you're-you're  not getting any younger."
197,Ross,"No I meanNo not you, not you, youyou are  getting younger."
198,Ross,I meanyou-you look like you're getting younger by the  secondWhat's your secret?
199,Ross,"Well, well to sum up, we're having fun, you look young."
200,Ross,But that's not enough.
201,Ross,So Sohere's a key to my  apartment.
202,Ross,Really.
203,Rachel,You gave her a key to your apartment?
204,Ross,"Not just a key, I gave her the only key!"
205,Ross,I am now a homeless person in a  very serious relationship.
206,Phoebe,Hey.
207,Phoebe,Ooh Ross!
208,Phoebe,How'd the conversation go?
209,Ross,"Oh great, I live on the street."
210,Phoebe,Where?
211,Rachel,Hey!
212,Phoebe,Hi!
213,Phoebe,"Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger."
214,Monica,Hi Roger.
215,Phoebe,"So umm, I'm gonna get us some drinks."
216,Phoebe,Would you help me  out?
217,Rachel,Yeah.
218,Phoebe,"Umm, he's here to have sex with you."
219,Rachel,What?
220,Phoebe,You're welcome.
221,Rachel,Phoebe no!
222,Phoebe,"It's okay, he's a virgin."
223,Monica,"Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he'll have  sex with you."
224,Phoebe,"Yeah, okay let's leave these two alone."
225,Rachel,No!
226,Rachel,"I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do  it with some random guy!"
227,Phoebe,Fine!
228,Phoebe,Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!
229,Chandler,"Oh that's all right sir, and that's just one girl."
230,Chandler,It's a hand.
231,Chandler,It's a thing you use as a Jack and Coke  holder.
232,Chandler,Oh no-no-no!
233,Ross,"Okay, and oh I'm gonna need a bunch of extra keys."
234,Ross,Apparently I give  them away for no reason at all.
235,Ross,No.
236,Ross,That guy is.
237,Ross,I'm trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.
238,Ross,I love you!
239,Chandler,Hi honey I'm home.
240,Monica,From the tequila factory?
241,Chandler,It was awful.
242,Chandler,To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that  you and I split up.
243,Chandler,"So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then  when I wouldn't give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!"
244,Monica,Come here.
245,Monica,I can breath through my mouth.
246,Chandler,Y'know what the worse part was?
247,Chandler,I got to see what my life would  be like without you.
248,Chandler,It was like It's a Wonderful Life with lap dances.
249,Chandler,"Please  promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each  other for the rest of our lives."
250,Monica,I promise.
251,Monica,"Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday  card this year?"
252,Chandler,"Ooh, I don't know if we're there yet."
253,Rachel,Yes.
254,Rachel,"Hi, I'd like to order a pizza."
255,Rachel,"Okay, can I ask you a question?"
256,Rachel,Is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight?
257,Rachel,Very Ambercrombie & Fitch.
258,Rachel,I'll call you back.
259,Joey,Who was that?
260,Rachel,It's just the pizza place.
261,Joey,You hung up on the pizza place?
262,Joey,I don't hang up on your friends.
263,Rachel,"I'm sorry honey, I'm just having a, having a rough day."
264,Joey,"Oh, what's wrong?"
265,Rachel,"Oh you really, you really just don't want to hear about it."
266,Joey,Then why did I ask?
267,Rachel,"Okay, it's justand this is really embarrassingbut  lately with this whole pregnancy thing I'm just finding myselfhow do I put this  umm, erotically charged."
268,Joey,Is that college talk for horny?
269,Rachel,Yeah.
270,Rachel,"So y'know, I have all of these feelings and I don't know  what to do about them, because I can't date like a normal person, which is fine  because I don't need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night."
271,Rachel,"Just sex, y'know?"
272,Rachel,"No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel  comfortable with and who knows what he's doing."
273,Rachel,"For just one great night, I mean is  that really sohardto find."
274,Rachel,So how was your day?
275,Joey,"Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon."
276,Rachel,"Well, I gotta get up early and it's almost seven o'clock."
277,Joey,"Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too."
278,Rachel,"Okay, good night!"
279,Joey,Good night.
280,Joey,I can't do it!
281,Rachel,I didn't ask you to do it!
282,Joey,You're Rachel!
283,Rachel,You're Joey!
284,Joey,You're my friend!
285,Rachel,Right back at ya!
286,Joey,"But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad."
287,Rachel,And so bad.
288,Rachel,I don't even know what you're talking about  because I didn't ask you to do anything!
289,Joey,I know!
290,Joey,Do you wanna do it?
291,Rachel,No!
292,Joey,"All right, me neither!"
293,Joey,I was just testing you!
294,Rachel,That's the end of this conversation!
295,Joey,This conversation never happened!
296,Rachel,Never happened!
297,Rachel,Good night!
298,Joey,Good night!
299,Joey,Get back in there!
300,Joey,Closing Credits
301,Phoebe,Hi.
302,Phoebe,"Listen, I'm sorry about that whole thing with Roger."
303,Phoebe,"It really  wasn't right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something  that I think you'll really enjoy."
304,Phoebe,"Now, this is just a loan."
305,Phoebe,Okay?
306,Phoebe,"I'm gonna, I'm gonna  want him back."
307,Phoebe,So  I'm gonna go now.
308,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, I thought I could do it and I can't!"
309,Phoebe,End
0,Rachel,Hi!
1,Ross,Hey!
2,Ross,So what's the big news you had us rush all the   way over here for?
3,Chandler,"Okay, our news."
4,Chandler,"My company has asked me to head   up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated."
5,Ross,Oh my God!
6,Phoebe,What?
7,Rachel,What?
8,Ross,Monday?
9,Joey,How long do you have to go for?
10,Chandler,They said it could be up to a year.
11,Joey,A year?
12,Rachel,Do you have to go?
13,Monica,I kind of have to don't I?
14,Monica,Because of this stupid   thing
15,Chandler,"There is nothing like the support of your loving   wife, huh?"
16,Joey,"Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa."
17,Joey,"Maybe you forgot,   but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week."
18,Chandler,"I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be   able to make it."
19,Joey,We were gonna go see the Jets!
20,Ross,"You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this   group together!"
21,Chandler,Really?
22,Ross,Not you.
23,Joey,I can't believe you guys are moving.
24,Phoebe,I call their apartment!!
25,Joey,Here you are
26,Rachel,Thank you Joey.
27,Rachel,You know what?
28,Rachel,I'm not even sure   I can have caffeine.
29,Ross,I went thru this with Ben and Carol.
30,Ross,One cup of coffee   won't affect your milk.
31,Rachel,Yeah.
32,Rachel,Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.
33,Rachel,Every time?
34,Joey,Uhuh.
35,Ross,"Rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little   question, okay?"
36,Ross,"Trust me, I know this."
37,Rachel,"All right, I trust you."
38,Ross,"Rachel, I can see you dialing!"
39,Ross,I don't understand why...
40,Rachel,I'm on the phone!
41,Rachel,Dr. Wiener?
42,Phoebe,It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby.
43,Phoebe,It's just so grown up.
44,Joey,"I know, yeah."
45,Joey,I feel like we're all growing up.
46,Joey,"Person   named Wiener, God that kills me."
47,Phoebe,Look at you all grown up.
48,Joey,"Actually, you know what?"
49,Joey,I am.
50,Joey,That whole thing with   Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship.
51,Joey,You know?
52,Joey,Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady.
53,Joey,"And looks   aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot."
54,Phoebe,"You know, I might know somebody."
55,Phoebe,"Hey, how about you   set me up with someone, and we double date!"
56,Joey,"I can do that, yeah."
57,Joey,How is Friday?
58,Phoebe,Done.
59,Phoebe,"Oh good, really?"
60,Joey,Yeah!

66,Joey,[SCENE
67,Chandler,Hey!
68,Monica,Hey!
69,Chandler,I've got good news!
70,Monica,You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?
71,Chandler,"Okay, I have news."
72,Chandler,You don't have to move to Tulsa.
73,Chandler,You can stay here and keep your job.
74,Monica,It's great!
75,Monica,How?
76,Monica,Chandler.
77,Monica,"Well my boss and I worked out a deal where I only   have to be in Tulsa four days a week, so the other three I can be here with   you."
78,Monica,So you're gonna be gone four days a week?
79,Monica,No.
80,Chandler,"I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?"
81,Monica,No.
82,Monica,I can't be away from you for that long.
83,Chandler,Really?
84,Monica,"Yeah, you're my husband."
85,Monica,I'm not gonna live in a   different state than you for 208 days out of the year.
86,Chandler,That's fast math!
87,Chandler,We could use you in Tulsa.
88,Monica,"Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but   if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you."
89,Chandler,"Hey, you said that without gagging!"
90,Monica,I know!
91,Rachel,Excuse me?
92,Rachel,Oh yeah?
93,Rachel,"Well, up yours too!"
94,Ross,Who the hell was that?
95,Rachel,Dr. Wiener.
96,Ross,"Rach, you can't call people at three in the morning."
97,Rachel,"Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!"
98,Ross,Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?
99,Rachel,"Yes, of course there is!"
100,Rachel,Okay?
101,Rachel,I'm not insane!
102,Ross,"Well, what was it?"
103,Rachel,Hiccups.
104,Ross,"Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any   little thing comes up."
105,Rachel,"Yeah well, not anymore I can't."
106,Rachel,He fired us!
107,Rachel,What   are we gonna do?
108,Rachel,We have to find a pediatrician.
109,Rachel,"Wait wait, Monica said that   when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor."
110,Rachel,What was his name?
111,Ross,Dr. Gettleman?
112,Ross,"Yeah I know, I don't think that's a   good idea."
113,Ross,"In fact, I think he's dead."
114,Rachel,Argh!
115,Rachel,Why does everything happen to me?
116,Ross,"Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another   doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well."
117,Rachel,What?
118,Rachel,"What, do you mean you're not feeling well?"
119,Rachel,What do you have?
120,Rachel,Is it Rubella?
121,Rachel,"Because don't go near Emma, she has not had   that shot."
122,Ross,You know?
123,Ross,"Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like!"
124,Rachel,"Wiener, Wiener  Wiener, Wiener!!"
125,Ross,Rachel!!
126,Rachel,Great!
127,Rachel,Now he's gonna know it was me!
128,Phoebe,Hey!
129,Joey,Hey!
130,Phoebe,So how is this for our big double date tonight?
131,Joey,Oh my God!
132,Phoebe,"Ooh, great!"
133,Phoebe,Just the reaction I was hoping for.
134,Joey,"Yeah, so you found someone for me."
135,Joey,You didn't forget?
136,Phoebe,Of course not!
137,Phoebe,And you're gonna love Mary Ellen.
138,Phoebe,"She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this,   but she' not opposed to threesomes."
139,Phoebe,So tell me some about my guy.
140,Joey,No.
141,Phoebe,"Come on, give me something."
142,Phoebe,What's his name?
143,Joey,Mike.
144,Phoebe,Mike?
145,Phoebe,Okay!
146,Phoebe,What's his last name?
147,Joey,Damnit!
148,Joey,Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!
149,Phoebe,"All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant   in a couple hours."
150,Phoebe,Joey and
151,Joey,Why did I have to say Mike?
152,Joey,I don't know a Mike!
153,Joey,Why   couldn't I have said...
154,Joey,There's no guy in   there!
155,Rachel,It's impossible to find a good doctor.
156,Rachel,"I mean, how   do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against   your knee?"
157,Monica,Excuse me?
158,Chandler,I know what she's talking about.
159,Rachel,We've got to find a new pediatrician.
160,Rachel,"Ross was getting   sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it."
161,Monica,Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?
162,Rachel,Ross said he died.
163,Monica,He didn't die.
164,Monica,I saw his daughter last week.
165,Monica,Said   he was fine.
166,Monica,"Her on the other hand, botched Botox."
167,Rachel,"Oh, great!"
168,Rachel,"Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see   him."
169,Rachel,I wonder why Ross said that he died.
170,Monica,"Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood   therapist."
171,Chandler,He saw a therapist?
172,Monica,"Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just   really freaked him out."
173,Rachel,Why?
174,Rachel,What was it?
175,Monica,That I was going to eat him.
176,Joey,MIKE!!
177,Joey,Okay!
178,Joey,Everything is gonna be fine.
179,Joey,"Just follow my lead, okay?"
180,Joey,All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.
181,Joey,Atta boy!
182,Joey,"Okay, look..."
183,Phoebe,"Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins."
184,Phoebe,"So, Mike, how do   you and Joey know each other anyway?"
185,Joey,From school.
186,Phoebe,"Wow, you guys go way back then."
187,Phoebe,So what are you up   to these days?
188,Joey,"Mike, 'attorney at law'!"
189,Joey,What?
190,Joey,That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.
191,Phoebe,"Wow, that's great!"
192,Phoebe,"I liked that better than the law   thing, so..."
193,Joey,Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to   Mike.
194,Joey,Mary
195,Joey,"No, no, that's not what I meant."
196,Joey,Let's get you a cocktail.
197,Monica,Hey!
198,Chandler,Hey!
199,Monica,What are you doing?
200,Chandler,Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
201,Monica,That's so sweet.
202,Monica,Find anything?
203,Chandler,Slim Pickings.
204,Monica,"Nothing, huh?"
205,Chandler,"No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant."
206,Chandler,They're looking for a cook.
207,Chandler,Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch.
208,Chandler,They're   looking for someone to shovel mesquite.
209,Monica,'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.
210,Chandler,'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
211,Monica,"Honey, that's okay."
212,Monica,"I actually know this woman, Nancy,   who's a restaurant biz head-hunter."
213,Monica,Maybe she'll know of something.
214,Chandler,Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming   with me.
215,Chandler,When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'.
216,Chandler,'So Cheesy'?
217,Chandler,'Whole Hog'?
218,Chandler,It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.
219,Monica,"Hi, Nancy."
220,Monica,"Hi, it's Monica Geller."
221,Monica,I'm   good.
222,Monica,"Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa."
223,Monica,"Well yeah, my husband has been   relocated...Because I love him!"
224,Monica,"No, I don't want a job in New York."
225,Monica,Javo    is looking?
226,Monica,Oh my God!
227,Monica,He asked for me personally?
228,Monica,Oh my God!
229,Monica,"Oh, wow, this   is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa."
230,Monica,"Yeah, so if you would tell Javo    'I'll take it!'"
231,Rachel,"Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment   for Emma."
232,Ross,Thanks doctor.
233,Ross,Dr.
234,Ross,You even have to ask?!
235,Ross,He is alive!
236,Phoebe,"You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have   known each other for so long and I've never heard about you."
237,Joey,"Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out."
238,Joey,Mike hit my mom with a car.
239,Joey,"That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you."
240,Joey,And now we're   friends again everything's great!
241,Joey,"Mary Ellen Wait, is your mom okay?"
242,Joey,"Please, we're trying to have a conversation."
243,Joey,Mary
244,Phoebe,What?
245,Joey,What?
246,Phoebe,Do you not know each other?
247,Joey,Of course we do!
248,Joey,Mike is playing a game that   we used to play in high school.
249,Joey,"Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other."
250,Joey,We played all kinds of games.
251,Joey,"Hey, remember the one where I punch   you in the face for not being cool?"
252,Phoebe,"Mike, let me ask you something."
253,Phoebe,How many sisters   does Joey have?
254,Joey,What are you doing?
255,Joey,I said seven!
256,Joey,Argh!!
257,Phoebe,"Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?"
258,Joey,"Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry."
259,Phoebe,You are unbelievable!
260,Phoebe,"I spent so much time   finding the perfect girl for you, you know."
261,Phoebe,Mary Ellen is really smart and   cute and loose.
262,Phoebe,Mary
263,Phoebe,Who are you kidding?
264,Phoebe,You just find some   guy off the street for me?
265,Phoebe,Oh God!
266,Phoebe,This is humiliating!
267,Joey,Look Phoebe I'm so sorry!
268,Joey,"Hey, look, if you don't like   this guy I can find you a better one."
269,Joey,Mike!!
270,Joey,Mike!
271,Phoebe,I'm out of here
272,Joey,You're leaving too?
273,Joey,Mary
274,Joey,Good night!
275,Chandler,"Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got   a lot of packing to do."
276,Monica,You're right.
277,Monica,Maybe I shouldn't go.
278,Chandler,What?
279,Monica,"So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant,   Javo ."
280,Monica,It's just a little outside of Tulsa.
281,Chandler,How far outside?
282,Monica,Manhattan.
283,Chandler,And you're thinking of taking it?
284,Chandler,"So before   you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now   it's old job,  me,  new job."
285,Monica,I'm gonna miss this hand!
286,Monica,"Okay I know it's a lot   to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity."
287,Chandler,What happened to 'you can't live without me four   days a week'?
288,Monica,"Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days   is not that long."
289,Monica,"I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see   you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really   if you think about it, it's really just one day."
290,Monica,"And well, if we can't make   it one day, we've got real problems my friend."
291,Chandler,I think you should take the job.
292,Monica,Really?
293,Chandler,Yeah.
294,Chandler,I know it must be important to you when you   start chattering like a monkey.
295,Monica,That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!
296,Ross,Hey!
297,Monica,How was the pediatrician?
298,Rachel,"Oh, I really liked him."
299,Rachel,"Yeah, it   was really, really, really good."
300,Ross,You promised you wouldn't say anything.
301,Rachel,I know.
302,Rachel,Ross still sees his pediatrician!!!
303,Rachel,I don't care!
304,Monica,Are you serious?
305,Monica,You still see Dr. Gettleman?
306,Ross,He's a brilliant diagnostician!
307,Chandler,Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
308,Rachel,"Ross, seriously!"
309,Rachel,You've gotta go to an appropriate   doctor.
310,Ross,Why?
311,Ross,Why?
312,Ross,"I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's   a great doctor, okay?"
313,Ross,"He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there,   he makes a big deal."
314,Ross,"'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'"
315,Chandler,Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer   in your touchy?
316,Ross,"Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security   blanket to college!"
317,Chandler,That was not a security blanket!
318,Chandler,That was a wall-hanging!
319,Ross,It didn't spend much time on the wall!!
320,Phoebe,Sure.
321,Phoebe,Why did you go along with that?
322,Phoebe,That's true.
323,Phoebe,"Well, is anything you told me   about yourself true?"
324,Phoebe,Prove it.
325,Phoebe,That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.
326,Phoebe,You are really good!
327,Phoebe,I play a little guitar myself.
328,Phoebe,Uhuh.
329,Phoebe,"Well, like acoustic folksy stuff."
330,Phoebe,You know?
331,Phoebe,But right   now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers.
332,Phoebe,It's okay.
333,Phoebe,"Go ahead, ask me out."
334,Phoebe,"Oh, you just caught me off guard!"
335,Phoebe,"Yeah,   that would be nice."
336,Joey,Look at this.
337,Joey,My two best friends!
338,Ross,"Excuse me, I don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby   with the rash came in after me."
339,Ross,With the circus?
340,Ross,He's behind the elephant.
341,Ross,"Yeah, that's how I know."
342,Ross,I'm Ross by the way.
343,Ross,I am a single parent.
344,Ross,"Well, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the   pediatrician's office."
345,Ross,"Hmm, yeah."
346,Ross,Come   on Ross jr.
347,Ross,It's time to go in.
348,Ross,"Hey, I helped you find Waldo!"
349,Ross,"Oh good, you haven't left yet."
350,Monica,Where have you been?
351,Ross,I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office.
352,Ross,There was   some guy that freaked everybody out.
353,Chandler,"Well, you got here just in time."
354,Chandler,I really have   to go buddy.
355,Ross,Oh man.
356,Monica,Promise to call me when you land.
357,Chandler,Of course I will call you.
358,Chandler,I love you.
359,Monica,I love you too.
360,Rachel,"Okay, wow, wow, wow."
361,Rachel,"Watch the tongue people, we've   got a baby over here."
362,Phoebe,Bye Chandler.
363,Chandler,Awww.
364,Chandler,Bye!
365,Rachel,Bye honey.
366,Chandler,What's the   matter Joe?
367,Joey,I'm mad at you for leaving!
368,Joey,You're nothing but a big   leaver.
369,Joey,Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.
370,Chandler,Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make   all this easier?
371,Joey,"Dude, you see right thru me!"
372,Chandler,"Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!"
373,Phoebe,"Okay, bye-bye!"
374,Phoebe,Good   trip!
375,Monica,"Chandler, wait."
376,Monica,It
377,Chandler,I know.
378,Monica,I love you so much.
379,Chandler,I know that too.
380,Chandler,"Don't worry, I'll be back before   you know it."
381,Chandler,Yes it will be the same.
382,Chandler,"Because I know, that's how."
383,Chandler,I promise.
384,Chandler,CUT
385,Joey,Double promise?
386,Joey,Call me   when you land.
387,Monica,Can I talk now?
388,Joey,"Okay, bye."
389,Monica,Joey?
390,Joey,He had to board.
0,Ross,Chandler!!!
1,Ross,Chandler!!!
2,Ross,"Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window!"
3,Ross,"Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister!"
4,Ross,Now get out here!
5,Chandler,Wow!
6,Chandler,"Listen, we had a good run."
7,Chandler,What was it?
8,Chandler,Four?
9,Chandler,Five months?
10,Chandler,"I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime!"
11,Chandler,"So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!"
12,Monica,What are you doing?
13,Chandler,"Oh, I'm going on the lamb."
14,Monica,"Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross."
15,Monica,Hold on!
16,Monica,Hey Ross.
17,Monica,What's up bro?
18,Ross,What the hell are doing?!
19,Rachel,"Hey, what's-what's going on?"
20,Chandler,"Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica."
21,Joey,Dude!
22,Joey,He's right there!
23,Ross,"I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister!"
24,Ross,My best friend and my sister!
25,Ross,I-I cannot believe this!
26,Chandler,"Look, we're not just messing around!"
27,Chandler,I love her.
28,Chandler,"Okay, I'm in love with her."
29,Monica,I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way.
30,Monica,"I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too."
31,Ross,My best friend and my sister!
32,Ross,I cannot believe this.
33,Ross,"You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh?"
34,Ross,Big news!
35,Rachel,"Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while."
36,Ross,What?
37,Ross,What?
38,Ross,What?!
39,Ross,You guys knew?
40,Ross,You all knew and you didn't tell me?!
41,Rachel,"Well, Ross, we were worried about you."
42,Rachel,We didn't know how you were going to react.
43,Ross,You were worried about me?
44,Ross,You didn't know how I was going to react?
45,Joey,"Okay, all right, whew!"
46,Joey,What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business?
47,Joey,"Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister."
48,Joey,Opening Credits
49,Ross,"Hey, you know what I just realized?"
50,Ross,If you guys ever have kids
51,Chandler,Whoa-whoa-whoa!
52,Chandler,We're having kids?
53,Joey,I call Godfather!
54,Ross,You can't just call Godfather.
55,Ross,Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
56,Joey,"Sure, if you cared enough to call it first."
57,Monica,"Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us."
58,Chandler,"Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps."
59,Rachel,Oh!
60,Rachel,"Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you."
61,Phoebe,"Ooh, I'll go in on that with you!"
62,Phoebe,I couldn't think of anything.
63,Rachel,Okay.
64,Joey,"Oh, hey Katie!"
65,Joey,"Everyone, this is Katie."
66,Joey,"So, are you ready to go?"
67,Joey,"Oh sure, right back there."
68,Joey,I was thinking Chinese food.
69,Rachel,She is so cute!
70,Rachel,You could fit her right in your little pocket!
71,Joey,I don't know.
72,Joey,"I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but"
73,Monica,But what?
74,Joey,She keeps punching me.
75,Monica,"In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?"
76,Joey,"Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks!"
77,Joey,Okay?
78,Joey,She-she-she's hurting me.
79,Monica,"I know what you need, you need a bodyguard."
80,Monica,"Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?"
81,Chandler,"Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem!"
82,Chandler,A little girl is beating him up.
83,Rachel,"Aww, Joey, come here."
84,Rachel,"Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry."
85,Rachel,Am I hurting you?
86,Ross,Hey!
87,Phoebe,Hey!
88,Phoebe,I brought you some house warming gifts.
89,Ross,Aww.
90,Phoebe,Yeah.
91,Phoebe,"Salt, so your life always has flavor."
92,Ross,Huh.
93,Phoebe,"Bread, so you never go hungry."
94,Ross,Ohh.
95,Phoebe,"And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know."
96,Ross,Thanks.
97,Ross,Thanks.
98,Ross,And thanks again.
99,Phoebe,Yeah!
100,Ross,Hi!
101,Ross,Oh hi!
102,Ross,Ross Geller.
103,Ross,And this is my friend Phoebe.
104,Phoebe,Mr. President.
105,Ross,Howard?
106,Ross,Oh that's nice.
107,Ross,Oh.
108,Ross,Uhh
109,Ross,"No-no, it's not that, it's just I-I just moved in."
110,Ross,"Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes."
111,Ross,"No wait, look."
112,Ross,Look!
113,Ross,"I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard."
114,Ross,I-I mean I don't know Howard.
115,Ross,"Yes but too me he's just, man."
116,Ross,"Ugh, can you believe that guy!"
117,Phoebe,Yeah.
118,Phoebe,I really like his glasses.
119,Ross,"so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me!"
120,Ross,A little kid spit on my knee!
121,Ross,Y'know what I'm gonna do?
122,Ross,I'm gonna throw a party.
123,Ross,That's right.
124,Ross,"For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy."
125,Ross,I am not a cheap guy!
126,Ross,I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in.
127,Ross,A man with principles.
128,Chandler,Sounds like a fun party.
129,Rachel,Hmm.
130,Rachel,"Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks?"
131,Rachel,The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
132,Ross,It doesn't matter!
133,Ross,It's my principles!
134,Ross,We're talking about my principles!
135,Rachel,"Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you."
136,Ross,"Oh, they'll like me."
137,Ross,Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY!
138,Ross,"Okay, I gotta run."
139,Ross,I gotta go get some nametags.
140,Rachel,And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
141,Chandler,"Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica."
142,Chandler,I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
143,Rachel,"Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head."
144,Chandler,Wh-wh-why?
145,Rachel,"Well, because she loves you and because you love her."
146,Chandler,"Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?"
147,Rachel,"Hey, Chandler, don't freak out!"
148,Rachel,I'm telling you something you already know!
149,Rachel,"Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies."
150,Rachel,"And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica."
151,Chandler,I don't see it that way.
152,Chandler,Okay?
153,Chandler,"Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date."
154,Chandler,"Now, who's to say what she wants?!"
155,Chandler,I'm right.
156,Chandler,I'm right.
157,Chandler,Am I right?
158,Rachel,"No, you're right, you are absolutely right."
159,Rachel,"I mean that makes, that makes everything different."
160,Chandler,Okay.
161,Chandler,"It's not different at all, is it?"
162,Rachel,Not unless different means the same.
163,Joey,"Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny."
164,Joey,"Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk."
165,Joey,Okay?
166,Joey,"Umm, look I like you."
167,Joey,"I-I really do, I like you a lot."
168,Joey,Okay?
169,Joey,"But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat."
170,Monica,Isn't this great?
171,Chandler,Hmm.
172,Monica,Couldn't you just stay like this forever?
173,Monica,Chandler!
174,Monica,Couldn't you just stay here forever?
175,Chandler,"Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever."
176,Monica,Are you okay?
177,Chandler,"Yeah, I'm cool."
178,Chandler,Casual.
179,Monica,What-what are you doing?
180,Chandler,I'm just hanging out.
181,Chandler,"Y'know, having fun."
182,Chandler,Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
183,Monica,"Man, I knew it!"
184,Monica,I knew you were going to do this!
185,Chandler,What?
186,Monica,Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
187,Chandler,"Well, you do want all that stuff, right?"
188,Monica,Oh and you know what I want!
189,Chandler,Yes!
190,Chandler,You want babies!
191,Chandler,You have baby fever!
192,Monica,I do not have baby fever!
193,Chandler,"Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage!"
194,Chandler,"I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?"
195,Monica,Have you lost your mind?
196,Monica,"Chandler, this isn't about me!"
197,Monica,This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
198,Chandler,Nah-uh!
199,Chandler,I know you!
200,Chandler,Okay?
201,Chandler,I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
202,Monica,You don't know everything.
203,Monica,Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you?
204,Monica,Hmm?
205,Monica,And did you know that the only baby around here is you?!
206,Monica,And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?
207,Chandler,"Well, I did not know that."
208,Chandler,Commercial Break
209,Chandler,"It's gonna be okay, right?"
210,Chandler,I mean she's not gonna leave me?
211,Chandler,"This is, this is fixable."
212,Chandler,Ross and
213,Joey,"Oh yeah, yeah, sure."
214,Joey,Absolutely.
215,Chandler,By me?
216,Ross,"Oh, no!"
217,Joey,No-no.
218,Ross,"Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture."
219,Joey,"Yeah, big!"
220,Joey,"Uh-oh, shht!"
221,Joey,The Misses.
222,Monica,"Gunther, can I get a coffee  to go?"
223,Chandler,Monica.
224,Monica,I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
225,Chandler,Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
226,Monica,What?
227,Chandler,"Well, that's what we do."
228,Chandler,"Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again."
229,Monica,Really?
230,Monica,I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor.
231,Monica,You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself.
232,Monica,All right?
233,Monica,Y'know what?
234,Monica,"If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one."
235,Ross,Phoebe!
236,Phoebe,"Oh, hi Ross!"
237,Ross,What are you doing?
238,Phoebe,"Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it's a party for Howard."
239,Phoebe,He's just the sweetest little man!
240,Phoebe,Guest #1
241,Ross,You chipped in?
242,Phoebe,"Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars."
243,Ross,Phoebe!
244,Ross,I can't believe you gave them money!
245,Ross,I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
246,Phoebe,"Yeah, but they didn't ask me!"
247,Phoebe,Y'know?
248,Phoebe,"This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger."
249,Phoebe,That's always fun to be.
250,Ross,"Yeah, but you're making me look bad!"
251,Phoebe,No I'm not.
252,Phoebe,No!
253,Phoebe,If anything I'm making you look better!
254,Phoebe,They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
255,Phoebe,Hey!
256,Phoebe,"Yeah, okay, my bad."
257,Joey,Hey!
258,Rachel,Hi!
259,Rachel,Wow!
260,Rachel,"You look, you lookbig."
261,Joey,Thanks!
262,Joey,I've been working out.
263,Joey,"Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?"
264,Rachel,"Uhhh, yeah."
265,Rachel,But it's not obvious why.
266,Joey,"Well look, I'm breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding."
267,Joey,Y'know?
268,Joey,"I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?"
269,Joey,Hey!
270,Joey,Hiya!
271,Rachel,Hey!
272,Rachel,"Hey, cute jacket!"
273,Rachel,Oh!
274,Rachel,Ow!
275,Rachel,Whoa!
276,Rachel,Y'know what Katie?
277,Rachel,I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
278,Rachel,"Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!"
279,Rachel,"Ohh, you're so sweet!"
280,Joey,Huh.
281,Joey,Uhh.
282,Joey,Nah.
283,Ross,Phoebe?
284,Phoebe,That's what I'm saying.
285,Ross,Phoebe?
286,Ross,Phoebe?
287,Phoebe,Ooh.
288,Ross,"Look, this is a disaster!"
289,Ross,Can't I please just go?
290,Phoebe,No!
291,Phoebe,No!
292,Phoebe,I'm talking you up to people.
293,Phoebe,"Just give it a little time, all right?"
294,Phoebe,"Relax, get something to eat!"
295,Phoebe,Okay?
296,Ross,"So uh, what did you tell them about me?"
297,Phoebe,"Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily."
298,Phoebe,"Y'know, try to get some sympathy."
299,Ross,Ohh.
300,Phoebe,But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
301,Ross,What?
302,Phoebe,"Yeah, I think I told it wrong."
303,Phoebe,"Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there."
304,Ross,"Ohh, this cake is really good!"
305,Phoebe,"Oh, okay, see?"
306,Phoebe,Things are looking up already!
307,Phoebe,Guest #2
308,Phoebe,"All right, everyone calm down!"
309,Phoebe,Everyone calm down!
310,Phoebe,I have something that I would like to say!
311,Phoebe,Who here likes Ross?
312,Phoebe,Of course you don't like him!
313,Phoebe,"He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, ""Who hear likes Ross,"" and he's wearing two nametags!"
314,Phoebe,"I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all!"
315,Phoebe,But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous.
316,Phoebe,"I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right?"
317,Phoebe,"I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid!"
318,Phoebe,"And okay, you guys   Gold-digger,  cradle robbing perv!"
319,Phoebe,"So, I think you all know what I mean."
320,Phoebe,Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things.
321,Phoebe,"I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero."
322,Ross,"Oh wow, yeah!"
323,Ross,"See, I did not get that."
324,Chandler,Where's Monica?!
325,Chandler,Where is she?
326,Chandler,I need to talk to her!
327,Chandler,It's urgent!
328,Chandler,Is she here?
329,Monica,I'm Monica.
330,Chandler,"I need to talk to you, it's urgent!"
331,Monica,Okay.
332,Chandler,"Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking."
333,Chandler,"And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this."
334,Monica,Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?
335,Chandler,Monica
336,Monica,"No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!"
337,Chandler,Will you marry me?
338,Ross,Oh-no.
339,Ross,No.
340,Ross,No.
341,Joey,What a bad idea!
342,Rachel,"Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!"
343,Monica,"Chandler, why are you doing this?"
344,Chandler,I don't know.
345,Chandler,But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
346,Monica,Chandler.
347,Chandler,I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
348,Monica,"Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?"
349,Chandler,"No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy."
350,Chandler,"Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married."
351,Chandler,Will you be my wife?
352,Monica,"Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds."
353,Chandler,"Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now."
354,Monica,Honey!
355,Monica,Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?!
356,Monica,I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
357,Chandler,"Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys."
358,Monica,Who?
359,Monica,Two divorces and Joey?
360,Ross,Hey!
361,Joey,She's right y'know.
362,Ross,"Yeah, but still, cheap shot!"

458,Phoebe,Do you think we should bring them some?
459,Joey,"When they're hungry enough, they'll come in."
460,Monica,Let go!
461,Ross,No!
462,Ross,You let go!
463,Monica,No!
464,Ross,How come it's always us left in the field holding the ball?
465,Monica,I don't know.
466,Monica,I guess the other people just don't care enough.
467,Ross,Hey!

470,Monica,Let go!
471,Monica,End

32,Joey,"Uhh, my stunt double."

34,Chandler,Y'know what?
35,Chandler,I have been trying to apologize to him all week!
36,Chandler,"If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person."
37,Joey,"Uhh Pheebs, I heard that."
38,Joey,Can you put him on?
39,Phoebe,Yeah!

59,Monica,Phoebe?
60,Monica,"Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry."
61,Monica,Have you been here long?
62,Phoebe,It's okay.
63,Phoebe,What the hell took you so long?
64,Monica,"Okay, you can not tell Chandler."
65,Monica,Okay?
66,Monica,That I ran into Richard.
67,Phoebe,Which Richard?
68,Monica,The Richard.
69,Phoebe,Richard Simmons?!
70,Phoebe,Oh my God!
71,Monica,Noo!
72,Monica,My ex-boyfriend Richard!
73,Monica,"Y'know the tall guy, moustache?"
74,Phoebe,Oh!
75,Phoebe,"Okay, that actually makes more sense."
76,Phoebe,So how was it?
77,Monica,"It was, it was really nice."
78,Monica,We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
79,Phoebe,That is so weird!
80,Phoebe,I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
81,Monica,Really?
82,Phoebe,"But again, Simmons."
83,Phoebe,Go on.
84,Monica,"The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!"
85,Phoebe,Ooh!
86,Phoebe,So now why can't we tell Chandler?
87,Monica,Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary.
88,Monica,I just don't want anything to spoil that.
89,Phoebe,"Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!"
90,Monica,I know.
91,Phoebe,Wow!
92,Phoebe,I owe Rachel 20 bucks!
93,Monica,What?
94,Phoebe,On a totally different bet.
95,Chandler,Hey!
96,Monica,It's almost our anniversary!
97,Chandler,I know.
98,Chandler,Can you believe it?
99,Chandler,One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
100,Phoebe,Awww!
101,Phoebe,Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
102,Chandler,Huh.
103,Monica,I got you a present!
104,Chandler,"Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!"
105,Monica,"I know, but you have to open it today!"
106,Chandler,Okay.
107,Monica,Okay!
108,Monica,There you go!
109,Monica,It's two tickets to Vegas!
110,Chandler,Wow!
111,Monica,For this weekend!
112,Monica,"Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane."
113,Monica,We can call it out plane-aversary.
114,Chandler,Do we have to?
115,Monica,No.
116,Chandler,"Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there."
117,Monica,"Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble."
118,Monica,Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him!
119,Monica,"Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary!"
120,Monica,A-Nevadaversary!
121,Chandler,"Yeah, I think we should see other people."
122,Monica,"But we can go, right?"
123,Chandler,Yes.
124,Monica,Okay!
125,Chandler,It's a great idea.
126,Phoebe,"Okay, I'm gonna go too!"
127,Chandler,"Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our  anniversary."
128,Phoebe,"Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London."
129,Monica,Ditch you?
130,Monica,"Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!"
131,Phoebe,"Uh-huh, great story!"
132,Phoebe,I'm going!
133,Rachel,Hi!
134,Phoebe,Hey!
135,Ross,Hey!
136,Phoebe,"Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey!"
137,Phoebe,Including me!!
138,Phoebe,You wanna go?
139,Rachel,"Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work."
140,Phoebe,Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
141,Rachel,"Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow."
142,Rachel,I can't miss that.
143,Ross,"Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit!"
144,Ross,I've been waiting like a year for this.
145,Chandler,Art lover!
146,Ross,What'd you say?
147,Chandler,I said art lover.
148,Ross,Is that supposed to be an insult?
149,Chandler,"I don't know, I'm very tired."
150,Ross,"So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday."
151,Rachel,That sounds great.
152,Ross,Yeah?
153,Ross,All right I'll call the airlines.
154,Rachel,Okay.
155,Rachel,"Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night."
156,Phoebe,"Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked."
157,Rachel,No!
158,Rachel,So I can be by myself.
159,Rachel,Y'know?
160,Rachel,Have a little alone time.
161,Phoebe,Naked alone time.
162,Rachel,No!
163,Rachel,Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked.
164,Rachel,"I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked."
165,Phoebe,Uh-huh!
166,Phoebe,Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
167,Phoebe,"So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?"
168,Chandler,So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
169,Phoebe,"Okay, what about after I give you these candies?"
170,Chandler,"Yeah, I guess it's a little better now."
171,Phoebe,Ah-ha!
172,Phoebe,"Okay,  Las Vegas 1, London 0!"
173,Phoebe,I'll be right back.
174,Chandler,Happy plane-aversary.
175,Monica,Aww!
176,Monica,I love you!
177,Chandler,Can I give you a present now?
178,Monica,Okay!
179,Chandler,Okay!
180,Chandler,Oh man!
181,Chandler,Don't tell me I did this!
182,Monica,"I love the ""I forgot the present"" fake out!"
183,Chandler,"How do you feel about the, ""I really did forgot the present, please forgive me"" not fake out?"
184,Monica,Oh that's okay.
185,Monica,"Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back."
186,Chandler,Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
187,Phoebe,Oh good!
188,Phoebe,"All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing."
189,Chandler,What-what Richard thing?
190,Phoebe,Oh no.
191,Chandler,What Richard thing?
192,Phoebe,Simmons!
193,Phoebe,Go with Simmons!
194,Monica,"Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did."
195,Monica,The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
196,Chandler,I'm not mad.
197,Monica,Really?
198,Chandler,Oh yeah!
199,Chandler,"Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard!"
200,Chandler,You grabbed a bite!
201,Chandler,It's no big deal.
202,Monica,Great!
203,Phoebe,"Okay, London 1"
204,Rachel,Oh!
205,Rachel,Look what happened!
206,Rachel,"{Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up."

215,Ross,I can't look at that!
216,Ross,I am looking at this.
217,Ross,"Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokesUnless she wants me to be looking at that."
218,Ross,She knows I'm home.
219,Ross,She knows I can see her.
220,Ross,What kind of game is she playing?
221,Ross,I think maybe someone's lonely tonight.
222,Ross,"Oh-ho, Dr. Geller!"
223,Ross,Stop it!

225,Ross,"Or, am I?"

241,Ross,This is just about tonight.
242,Ross,"I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of ""Us."""
243,Ross,Okay?

245,Rachel,"And um, what-what is that Ross?"
246,Ross,The physical act of love.

277,Phoebe,Huh!
278,Monica,"Phoebe, you don't eat animals."
279,Phoebe,"For 99 cents, I'd eat you."
280,Phoebe,"Okay, I can totally settle down here."
281,Phoebe,"It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey!"

295,Joey,I thought I told you not to come.
296,Phoebe,Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
297,Joey,"Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now."
298,Joey,"Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator."
299,Joey,"Uh, y'know what?"

308,Chandler,Why?!
309,Chandler,What happened?
310,Joey,"Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does."
311,Monica,I'm so sorry.
312,Joey,"Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya."
313,Joey,I'm sorry man.
314,Chandler,"No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody."
315,Monica,I knew you were not okay with that.
316,Phoebe,So you're a gladiator!
317,Phoebe,Wow!
318,Joey,"Yeah, what-what's going on?"
319,Phoebe,Monica had lunch with Richard.
320,Joey,Dawson?
321,Phoebe,Noo!
322,Phoebe,But that would've been so cool!
323,Chandler,No!
324,Chandler,Her boyfriend Richard!
325,Monica,It meant nothing!
326,Monica,Okay?
327,Monica,"After all this time, how can you not trust me?"
328,Chandler,When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
329,Monica,You're right.
330,Monica,I'm sorry.
331,Monica,I should've told you.
332,Chandler,Thanks.
333,Joey,"Aww, there we go."
334,Phoebe,I love Vegas!
335,Monica,"I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you."
336,Chandler,Next time?
337,Joey,"Ooh, so close."
338,Chandler,There's not gonna be a next time!
339,Chandler,You can not ever see him again!
340,Monica,I can not see him?
341,Monica,"I mean, you can't tell me what to do!"
342,Chandler,"That's so funny, because I think I just did!"
343,Monica,Oh y'know what?
344,Monica,"If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you."
345,Chandler,Fine with me!
346,Monica,Fine!
347,Monica,Happy Anniversary!
348,Joey,Whoa!

350,Joey,Guys!
351,Joey,Please!

355,Monica,No it is not!
356,Chandler,What are you talking
357,Joey,Hey-hey don't look at me!
358,Joey,I just work here!
359,Rachel,"Okay umm, Ross?"
360,Rachel,"I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater."
361,Rachel,"Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love."
362,Ross,Yep!
363,Ross,That's hilarious!
364,Rachel,I'm sorry.
365,Rachel,I'm done.
366,Rachel,I'm done.
367,Ross,"Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too."
368,Rachel,"No, not really."
369,Rachel,I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
370,Ross,Uh-huh.
371,Ross,But it was a first for the rest of my building.
372,Rachel,Okay.
373,Rachel,"All right, that's true!"
374,Rachel,But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
375,Ross,What?!
376,Ross,You totally get embarrassed!
377,Rachel,"No, I don't!"
378,Rachel,"Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are."
379,Ross,Is that so?
380,Rachel,Yeah.
381,Ross,Hey lady!
382,Ross,I don't care how much you want it!
383,Ross,Okay?!
384,Ross,I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom!
385,Joey,"Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat."
386,Chandler,Really?
387,Joey,"Yeah, sure!"
388,Joey,Sure!
389,Joey,"They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it!"
390,Joey,They would use it to get the mud off their shoe.
391,Joey,And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right
392,Chandler,"Joey, I uh!"
393,Chandler,I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
394,Joey,"All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then."
395,Joey,Look!
396,Joey,A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
397,Chandler,Whoa!
398,Joey,"Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000."
399,Joey,Can you believe that?
400,Joey,"$5,000!"
401,Chandler,"Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!"
402,Joey,Wait a minute!
403,Joey,Why don't I do what that guy did?
404,Joey,"I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000!"
405,Joey,And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
406,Chandler,Good luck!
407,Joey,Chandler!
408,Joey,I don't need luck.
409,Joey,I have thought this through!
410,Chandler,I see.
411,Chandler,Commercial Break
412,Monica,Thank you.
413,Phoebe,Thanks.
414,Monica,I can't believe this!
415,Monica,This is like the worst night ever!
416,Phoebe,Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler.
417,Phoebe,Big deal!
418,Phoebe,It's only Chandler.
419,Phoebe,I am so sorry.
420,Monica,This is crazy!
421,Monica,"I mean, it's such a stupid argument."
422,Monica,I don't even wanna see Richard again.
423,Phoebe,So go fix it!
424,Phoebe,Go find Chandler!
425,Phoebe,He's probably up in your room!
426,Phoebe,Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
427,Monica,Y'know what?
428,Monica,You're right Phoebe.
429,Monica,You're right.

463,Chandler,What?
464,Joey,My identical hand twin!
465,Chandler,What's an identical hand twin?
466,Joey,What's it sound like?
467,Joey,It's a guy with my identical hands!
468,Joey,It was incredible!
469,Joey,"Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me!"
470,Joey,It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
471,Chandler,Are you sure you weren't  looking at your hands in a mirror?
472,Joey,Don't you see what this means?!
473,Joey,I can forget about that stupid movie.
474,Joey,I'm gonna be a millionaire!
475,Chandler,How?
476,Joey,"Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money!"
477,Joey,Come on!
478,Joey,Identical hands!
479,Chandler,"Again I must go back to, how?"
480,Joey,This is Vegas man!
481,Joey,People will pay to see freaky stuff!
482,Joey,"Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand  twice?"
483,Joey,Huh?
484,Chandler,"Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe."
485,Joey,"Hey, are you unsupporting me again?"
486,Chandler,No!
487,Chandler,No!

46,Joey,"I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great."
47,Monica,Yeah?
48,Monica,What does she think of your little science project?
49,Joey,"What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?"
50,Monica,Man's got a point.
51,Joey,"Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me."
52,Chandler,Crazy bitch.
53,Joey,"Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean."
54,Monica,Joey... we always know what you mean.
55,Phoebe,Hey.
56,Monica,Hey.
57,Ross,Hey.
58,Phoebe,How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?
59,Ross,I'm going to China.
60,Phoebe,"Jeez, you say one thing, and..."
61,Monica,You're going to China?
62,Ross,"Yeah, i-it's for the museum."
63,Ross,"Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the boit'sit's a whole big bone thing."
64,Ross,"Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't."
65,Ross,So here's my itinerary .
66,Ross,Um... here's a picture of me...
67,Phoebe,"Oh, let me see!"

72,Phoebe,"Aaaaaahhhh....  Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun."
73,Ross,"Hey, is Rachel here?"
74,Ross,"Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left."
75,Monica,"Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl."
76,Ross,Oh.
77,Ross,"Hey, who's Carl?"
78,Monica,"You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse."
79,Ross,No.
80,Phoebe,"Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the..."
81,Ross,"At the coffeehouse, right."
82,Phoebe,So you do know who he is!
83,Phoebe,Sorry.
84,Ross,"OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys."
85,Phoebe,"Oh, hey, y'know what?"
86,Phoebe,Tell them that bone story.
87,Ross,Hi.
88,Joey,Hey!
89,Chandler,Hey!
90,Ross,....I have to go to China.
91,Joey,The country?
92,Ross,"No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront."
93,Ross,Do you guys know who Carl is?
94,Chandler,"Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no."
95,Ross,"Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight."
96,Joey,Oh no!
97,Joey,How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!
98,Chandler,Forget about her.
99,Joey,"He's right, man."
100,Joey,Please.
101,Joey,Move on.
102,Joey,Go to China.
103,Joey,Eat Chinese food.
104,Chandler,"Course there, they just call it food."
105,Ross,Yeah...
106,Ross,I guess.
107,Ross,I don'tI don't know.
108,Ross,"Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK?"
109,Joey,"Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you."
110,Ross,I know.
111,Joey,We want you to be happy.
112,Joey,"And I may only have a couple beers in me, but..."
113,Joey,"I love you, man."
114,Chandler,I'm still on my first.
115,Chandler,I just think you're nice.
116,Joey,"Like the three musketeers, only with fruit."
117,Chandler,Ooooh.
118,Monica,"OK, how does everybody like their burgers?"
119,Rachel,"Oh, no, no, no."
120,Rachel,Presents first.
121,Rachel,Food later.
122,Monica,"Hey, hold on there, tiger."
123,Monica,How's it going?
124,Monica,How you holding up?
125,Joey,"Well, not so good."
126,Joey,"She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I..."
127,Joey,Then you do.
128,Joey,"Heh, heh."
129,Monica,"So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?"
130,Joey,What do you mean?
131,Monica,"Y'know, just be there for her."
132,Joey,Not following you.
133,Monica,Think about it.
134,Rachel,"OK, I'm guessing this is from..."
135,Rachel,"Well, thank you, Melanie."
136,Chandler,"OK, this one right here is from me."
137,Rachel,"OK... ah, it's light... ...it rattles... it's...  Travel Scrabble!"
138,Rachel,"Oooohhh, thank you!"
139,Rachel,This one's from Joey... feels like a book.
140,Rachel,Thinks it's a book... feels like a book.
141,Rachel,And......it's a book!
142,Phoebe,"Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!"
143,Chandler,"Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die."
144,Rachel,Who's this from?
145,Chandler,"Oh, that's Ross's."
146,Rachel,Oh... ...  Oh my God.
147,Rachel,He remembered.
148,Phoebe,Remembered what?
149,Rachel,It was like months ago.
150,Rachel,"We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl."
151,Rachel,Oh!
152,Rachel,I can't believe he remembered!
153,Chandler,"Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?"
154,Phoebe,"Oh, it's so pretty."
155,Phoebe,This must have cost him a fortune.
156,Monica,I can't believe he did this.
157,Chandler,"Come on, Ross?"
158,Chandler,"Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?"
159,Rachel,What did you just say?
160,Chandler,ahem... um...
161,Chandler,Crystal duck.
162,Rachel,"No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?"
163,Chandler,F-hah.... flennin....
164,Rachel,Oh.... my God.
165,Chandler,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no...."
166,Joey,"That's good, just keep rubbing your head."
167,Joey,That'll turn back time.
168,Joey,Commercial Break
169,Rachel,"I mean, this is unbelievable."
170,Phoebe,I know.
171,Phoebe,"This is really, really huge."
172,Chandler,No it's not.
173,Chandler,It's small.
174,Chandler,It's tiny.
175,Chandler,It's petite.
176,Chandler,It's wee.
177,Phoebe,Nuh-uh.
178,Phoebe,I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
179,Chandler,"OK, is there a mute button on this woman?"
180,Monica,I think this is so great!
181,Monica,"I mean, you and Ross!"
182,Monica,D-did you have any idea?
183,Rachel,No!
184,Rachel,None!
185,Rachel,"I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just..."
186,Joey,"Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something."
187,Rachel,Ross?
188,Rachel,All this time?
189,Rachel,"Well, I've got to talk to him."
190,Chandler,H-He's in China!
191,Joey,The country.
192,Monica,"No, no, wait."
193,Monica,His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
194,Chandler,What about the time difference?
195,Monica,From here to the airport?
196,Chandler,Yes!
197,Chandler,You're never gonna make it!
198,Monica,"Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?"
199,Rachel,I-I-I don't know.
200,Chandler,Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
201,Joey,"He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait."
202,Monica,"Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now."
203,Rachel,I don't know.
204,Rachel,Maybe I'll know when I see him.
205,Phoebe,"Here, look, alright, does this help?"
206,Rachel,"Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him."
207,Rachel,"I mean, this is just too big."
208,Rachel,"Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him."
209,Rachel,I...
210,Rachel,"I gotta... OK, I'll see you later."
211,Chandler,"Rachel, I love you!"
212,Chandler,Deal with me first!
213,Ross,Flight
214,Ross,Ni-chou chi-ma!
215,Rachel,Ross!
216,Rachel,"Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me...."
217,Rachel,Flight
218,Rachel,Hi.
219,Rachel,Flight
220,Rachel,"Oh, no, no, I don't have one."
221,Rachel,I just need to talk to my friend.
222,Rachel,Flight
223,Rachel,"No, I know, but Ihe just went on."
224,Rachel,"He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just..."
225,Rachel,Flight
226,Rachel,"OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me?"
227,Rachel,Please?
228,Rachel,This is very important.
229,Rachel,Flight
230,Rachel,Uh...
231,Rachel,I don't know.
232,Rachel,Flight
233,Joey,"Heh, heh."
234,Joey,It was nothin'.
235,Joey,Uhhh.. y'know what?
236,Joey,Forget about me.
237,Joey,"Let's, uh... let's give you another turn."
238,Joey,Sure!
239,Joey,Why not?
240,Joey,How do you mean?
241,Monica,"Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?"
242,Rachel,I don't know.
243,Rachel,I don't know...
244,Rachel,"I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross."
245,Rachel,Y'know what I mean?
246,Rachel,"I mean, it's Ross."
247,Rachel,Monica and
248,Phoebe,Sure.
249,Rachel,"I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great."
250,Monica,"Oh my God, me too!"
251,Monica,Oh!
252,Monica,"Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law!"
253,Monica,Y'know what the best part is?
254,Monica,The best part is that you already know everything about him!
255,Monica,"I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!"
256,Phoebe,"Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date."
257,Monica,Another good point.
258,Phoebe,"No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place."
259,Phoebe,"Y'know, it's... you're committed."
260,Rachel,Huh?
261,Phoebe,"Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?"
262,Monica,Why isn't it working out?
263,Rachel,I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
264,Monica,Is he not cute enough for you?
265,Rachel,No!
266,Monica,Does he not make enough money?
267,Rachel,"No, I'm just...."
268,Phoebe,Maybe there's someone else.
269,Rachel,Wha...
270,Monica,Is there?
271,Monica,Is there someone else?
272,Rachel,No!
273,Rachel,There is.. there is noone else!
274,Monica,Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!
275,Chandler,"Hey, big..."
276,Joey,Shhhh!
277,Chandler,...spender.
278,Joey,She's still asleep.
279,Chandler,So how'd it go?
280,Joey,"Oh, it was amazing."
281,Joey,You know how you always think you're great in bed?
282,Chandler,The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
283,Joey,"Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great."
284,Joey,So I had to do all this other stuff.
285,Joey,"And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!"
286,Chandler,"Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route."
287,Joey,It was amazing!
288,Joey,And not just for her... uh-uh.
289,Joey,"For me, too."
290,Joey,"It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind."
291,Joey,"But all my other senses are heightened, y'know?"
292,Joey,It's like...
293,Joey,I was able to appreciate it on another level.
294,Chandler,I didn't know you had another level.
295,Joey,I know!
296,Joey,Neither did I!
297,Monica,"Hey, great skirt!"
298,Monica,Birthday present?
299,Rachel,Yeah.
300,Monica,"Oh, from who?"
301,Rachel,From you.
302,Rachel,I exchanged the blouse you got me.
303,Monica,"Well, it's the thought."
304,Monica,"Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours?"
305,Monica,At gate 27-B?
306,Rachel,"Uh, yeah."
307,Rachel,"Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea."
308,Monica,"Oh, why?"
309,Rachel,"Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him."
310,Rachel,I would be going out with all of you.
311,Rachel,"Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna..."
312,Monica,"No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!"
313,Rachel,"Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so..."
314,Monica,I am not 'so'!
315,Monica,"OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but..."
316,Monica,I'll be good.
317,Monica,I promise.
318,Rachel,Who is it?
319,Rachel,C'mon up.
320,Monica,Behind my brother's back?
321,Monica,... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
322,Joey,Seven hundred bucks!
323,Chandler,"Alright, you did it!"
324,Chandler,Do we have any fruit?
325,Joey,"Man, hell of a two weeks, huh?"
326,Joey,"Y'know what, though?"
327,Joey,I really feel like I learned something.
328,Chandler,Really?
329,Chandler,"So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?"
330,Joey,"What, are you crazy?"
331,Joey,"When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?"
332,Ross,I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
333,Rachel,"Would you excuse me, please?"
334,Rachel,I'm trying to have a date here.
335,Ross,"Fine, just stop thinking about me."
336,Ross,"Can't do it, can you?"
337,Rachel,So I'm thinking about you.
338,Rachel,So what?
339,Ross,I don't get it.
340,Ross,"What do you see in this guy, anyway?"
341,Rachel,Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
342,Ross,"Rachel, come on."
343,Ross,Give us a chance.
344,Rachel,"Ross, it's too hard."
345,Ross,"No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else?"
346,Ross,Who cares about them.
347,Ross,This is about us.
348,Ross,"Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade."
349,Rachel,"Ross, you're like my best friend."
350,Ross,I know.
351,Rachel,"If we broke up, and I lost you..."
352,Ross,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
353,Ross,What makes you think we're gonna break up?
354,Rachel,"Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?"
355,Ross,No.
356,Ross,But... it only has to happen once.
357,Ross,"Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right?"
358,Ross,"I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?"
359,Rachel,I don't know...
360,Rachel,"I mean, I've never looked at you that way before."
361,Ross,"Well, start looking."
362,Rachel,Wow.
363,Rachel,Right!
364,Rachel,You're right!
365,Rachel,You know what?
366,Rachel,I forgot...
367,Rachel,I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport.
368,Rachel,I am so sorry!
369,Rachel,"I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do...."
370,Rachel,I meanI'm sorry.
371,Rachel,I-I-I gotta go.
372,Rachel,I'm sorry.
373,Rachel,"Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry."
374,Rachel,Hi.
375,Ross,"Oh, hey, hey, I got that."
376,Ross,No problem.
377,Ross,I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
378,Ross,Yeah.
379,Ross,"No, no, they will."
380,Ross,I just... uh... Ross and
381,Ross,"Come on, they're gonna love you."
382,Ross,End
0,Joey,Hey!
1,Joey,You guys!

33,Rachel,Will all the stars be there?
34,Joey,Many are scheduled to appear.
35,Rachel,Oh my God!
36,Rachel,Oh my God!
37,Rachel,I can't go!
38,Rachel,I'm gonna be too nervous!
39,Monica,"Okay, I'll go!"

44,Ross,and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it's collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it's predator.
45,Ross,Yes Mr. Lewis?
46,Ross,Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
47,Ross,Well we-we don't know for sure.
48,Ross,But in my head it-it sounded something like this.
49,Ross,"Of course, this is just conjecture."
50,Ross,"Okay, that's uh, that's all for today."
51,Ross,"Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?"
52,Ross,"Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I'm afraid I-I had to fail you."
53,Ross,Well you need 60% to pass
54,Ross,Seven.
55,Ross,No-no it's not.
56,Ross,What-what happened there Ned?
57,Ross,"Well I'm sorry but, that-that's really not my problem."
58,Ross,Well that brings me in the loop a little.
59,Ross,Okay!
60,Ross,"Umm, I uh, I'm your teacher."
61,Ross,"I'm sorry, you're-you're a student and I-and I like women."
62,Ross,In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.
63,Phoebe,Oh my God!
64,Phoebe,That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
65,Monica,Really?
66,Monica,"My God, he's really cute."
67,Phoebe,Go for it.
68,Monica,"Phoebe, I'm engaged!"
69,Phoebe,"I'm just saying, get his number just in case."
70,Phoebe,But no Chandler is in an accident and can't perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
71,Phoebe,The Cute
72,Monica,"Op, can I just tell you something?"
73,Monica,"Very flattered but umm, I'm engaged."
74,Monica,The Cute
75,Monica,Well you should be embarrassed.
76,Monica,The Cute
77,Phoebe,"I did, but that was really fun."
78,Joey,And the winner isJoey Tribbiani!
79,Joey,Oh Wow!
80,Joey,I honestly never expected this.
81,Joey,"I uh, I didn't prepare a speech."
82,Joey,"But umm, I'd like to thank  my parents, who've always been there for me."
83,Joey,"I'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel"
84,Rachel,I'm fourth!
85,Rachel,Look at you with your little maple syrup award!

98,Joey,Yeah!
99,Rachel,"So you'll definitely get onstage, even if you don't win."
100,Joey,What you-you don't think I'm gonna win?
101,Rachel,Well of course I do!
102,Rachel,"But y'know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey."
103,Rachel,I mean you're up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
104,Joey,Yeah.
105,Joey,"No-no I-I know I might not win, but it's justI've never even been nominated before!"
106,Joey,I want it so much.
107,Rachel,"Well Joey, you'll probably get it."
108,Rachel,But you should probably your-your gracious loser face.
109,Rachel,Y'know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win.
110,Rachel,Y'know?
111,Rachel,So it's sorta like
112,Joey,Hey!
113,Rachel,Y'know?
114,Joey,You practice losing the Grammies too?
115,Rachel,"Oh no, at the Grammies I always win."
116,Joey,Ah.
117,Phoebe,Oh hey!
118,Monica,Hey!
119,Monica,How'd your date go with Jake?
120,Phoebe,"Oh, great!"
121,Phoebe,"We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y'know, he'd kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck."
122,Monica,"Okay, stop it Phoebe, you're getting me all tingly."
123,Phoebe,"All I could think of was y'know, ""Is he gonna kiss me?"
124,Phoebe,"Is he gonna kiss me?"""
125,Monica,And did he?
126,Phoebe,"I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell."
127,Phoebe,But this hickey speaks for itself.
128,Monica,"Okay-okay, I got it."
129,Monica,I got it.
130,Phoebe,I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.
131,Monica,"Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler."
132,Monica,"Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again am I?"
133,Phoebe,You sound like a guy.
134,Monica,"No, a guy would be saying, ""I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else."""
135,Monica,Oh my God!
136,Monica,I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else!
137,Monica,I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up!
138,Monica,"I mean, II'm never gonna have a first kiss again."
139,Phoebe,You'll have a last kiss.
140,Ross,Can I ask you something?
141,Ross,Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
142,Joey,Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
143,Ross,There's this kid in my class who said he's in love with me.
144,Joey,Whoa!
145,Rachel,Whoa what?
146,Joey,Ross has a boyfriend.
147,Ross,I do-I do not have a boyfriend.
148,Ross,There's a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.
149,Rachel,Really?
150,Ross,Yeah!
151,Ross,I don't know.
152,Ross,"I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid."
153,Ross,What-what-what-what is it?!
154,Ross,Am I giving out some kind ofsexy professor vibe?
155,Rachel,Not right now.
156,Ross,It-itThe point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
157,Rachel,"Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid!"
158,Rachel,I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard!
159,Rachel,Y'know youI couldn't concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me.
160,Rachel,"I mean come on, you remember what's it's like to be 19 and in love."
161,Ross,Yeah.
162,Ross,I guess I can cut him some slack.
163,Rachel,Yeah.
164,Joey,How'd you get over that teacher?
165,Rachel,I didn't.
166,Rachel,I got under him.
167,Joey,Problem solved.
168,Phoebe,Okay bye.
169,Phoebe,Bye!
170,Phoebe,We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
171,Monica,"Phoebe, it's okay."
172,Monica,You don't have to tip toe around me.
173,Monica,"I-I've been thinking about it and umm, y'know what?"
174,Monica,I'm okay about not having that new relationship feeling
175,Phoebe,I miss you too!!!
176,Monica,See?
177,Monica,That's what I mean.
178,Monica,"I mean that, that's great!"
179,Monica,But I wouldn't trade in what I have for that.
180,Monica,"I mean I'm gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that's what makes me happy."
181,Monica,"Hey sweetie, come here!"
182,Monica,Come sit down.
183,Monica,Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful.
184,Monica,It really is don't you think?
185,Chandler,Oh totally!
186,Chandler,Pull my finger.

191,Rachel,Do you have your speech?
192,Joey,"Yeah, I got my speech!"
193,Rachel,Do you got your gracious loser face?
194,Joey,Yeah.
195,Rachel,"Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me!"
196,Rachel,You hug me!
197,Joey,Okay.
198,Joey,Can I squeeze your ass?
199,Rachel,On TV?!
200,Rachel,Yeah!

204,Joey,Commercial Break
205,Joey,Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home.
206,Joey,Unfortunately only one can.
207,Joey,The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff.
208,Joey,"From One Life to Live Mary Loren Bishop , from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives Jessica Ashley."
209,Joey,And the winner isJessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives.
210,Joey,"Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn't be with us tonight so I'll be accepting this award on her behalf."
211,Joey,And I'm sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me.
212,Joey,"She'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who's sittin' right there!"
213,Rachel,Joey!
214,Rachel,Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?
215,Joey,"Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won!"
216,Rachel,Oh my God you stole her award!
217,Joey,No-no!
218,Joey,"No, I'm accepting it on her behalf."
219,Rachel,Joey I don't think you know what behalf means.
220,Joey,Sure I do!
221,Joey,It's a verb!
222,Joey,"As in, ""I behalfin' it!"""
223,Rachel,"Joey, you have got to take this back!"
224,Joey,But why?!
225,Joey,I should've won one and I really want it and she didn't even care enough to come to the thing!
226,Joey,It could also be a Grammy.
227,Rachel,No!
228,Rachel,Joey!
229,Joey,Come on Rach!
230,Joey,No one saw me take it!
231,Joey,There was a whole table full of em.
232,Rachel,Do you really want an award you didn't win?
233,Joey,No!
234,Joey,I want an award I did win!
235,Joey,But nobody's giving me any of those!
236,Joey,"PlusHey Rach, if-if I put it up there  right?"
237,Joey,When people come over they'll see it and they'll think I won it.
238,Rachel,Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!
239,Joey,I can scratch that right off.
240,Rachel,"Joey no, this is wrong!"
241,Rachel,"You have to take it back, okay?"
242,Rachel,You don't want to win an award this way.
243,Rachel,You're very talented.
244,Rachel,And someday you're gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.
245,Joey,All right!
246,Rachel,All right?
247,Rachel,Thank you.
248,Joey,I'll take it back tomorrow.
249,Rachel,Thank you.
250,Joey,If I can't have it you can't have it!
251,Ross,"Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?"
252,Ross,And why exactly would I do that?
253,Ross,What?
254,Ross,No!
255,Ross,Well that's different!
256,Ross,Okay?
257,Ross,"Because he, he was actually in love with me!"
258,Ross,What?
259,Ross,I can't believe someone would do that for a grade.
260,Monica,Have you seen Chandler?
261,Phoebe,No.
262,Phoebe,Why?
263,Monica,Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I'm not gonna have and it's freaking me out.
264,Monica,I don't know what to do about it.
265,Phoebe,"Okay, don't sweat it."
266,Phoebe,Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system.
267,Phoebe,That guy's cute.
268,Monica,Phoebe!
269,Monica,Come on I'm serious!
270,Monica,I just got to talk to him about all this.
271,Phoebe,No that is the last thing you want to do!
272,Monica,Why?
273,Phoebe,Because you're marrying him!
274,Monica,You gotta help me out here Pheebs.
275,Phoebe,"All right, I've never been engaged and I've never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me."
276,Phoebe,"Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband."
277,Monica,So I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with?
278,Phoebe,That is correct!
279,Phoebe,"Yes, you're supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight."
280,Monica,Your mother told you this?
281,Phoebe,Yes!
282,Monica,The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
283,Phoebe,Oh my God!
284,Phoebe,You're right!
285,Phoebe,Go!
286,Phoebe,Go tell Chandler!
287,Phoebe,Hurry before it's too late!
288,Phoebe,Wait no!
289,Phoebe,Does this also mean putting out doesn't get you love?
290,Rachel,I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
291,Joey,Okay wait-wait p-please be cool!
292,Joey,Okay?
293,Joey,I work with this woman.
294,Rachel,"Okay, I'm totally cool!"
295,Rachel,Jessica
296,Joey,Hey Jessica.
297,Rachel,Hey Jess.
298,Joey,"Ah, this is my friend Rachel."
299,Joey,Jessica
300,Rachel,Sup?
301,Joey,"Uh listen, here's your Soapie."
302,Joey,I accepted it for ya.

305,Joey,"You're gonna, you're gonna put it on your self or anything?"
306,Joey,Jessica
307,Joey,Take it back?
308,Rachel,Absolutely.
309,Joey,Y-y-yeah!
310,Joey,Yeah you do.
311,Monica,"Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?"
312,Chandler,Okay.
313,Chandler,"Well, I think the centerpieces are too big"
314,Monica,You're wrong!
315,Monica,The centerpieces are fine!
316,Monica,Do you ever get scared at all?
317,Chandler,Kinda.
318,Chandler,They're really big.
319,Monica,Doesn't it ever just freak you out that-that you're never gonna be with anybody new again?
320,Chandler,What?
321,Monica,"Just, I love you so much."
322,Monica,JustIt's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never gonna have that feeling.
323,Monica,Y'know when you meet someone for the first time and it's new and exciting?
324,Monica,Y'know that rush?
325,Chandler,No.
326,Chandler,"No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating."
327,Monica,"Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?"
328,Chandler,"Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I'm afraid even more sweating."
329,Monica,Even with me?
330,Chandler,I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship.
331,Chandler,"Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives."
332,Monica,Really?
333,Chandler,Well yeah!
334,Chandler,"But now that I know that you're having these thoughts, I'm back to panic, anxiety, and uh I'm definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink."
335,Monica,Come here!
336,Monica,Come here!
337,Monica,Sweetie you don't have to worry.
338,Monica,"No, besides y'know what?"
339,Monica,I'm gonna have a lot of new things with you.

348,Ross,Do-do you looove it?
349,Ross,I just want you to know that I'm changing your grade back.
350,Ross,Cause I know what you're trying to pull here.
351,Ross,Okay?
352,Ross,It's not gonna work.
353,Ross,Y'know what?
354,Ross,I-I'm not even gonna talk about this.
355,Ross,Okay?
356,Ross,This little thing is over.
357,Ross,I know you have a girlfriend!
358,Ross,OkayYeah!
359,Ross,And I know about the other professors!
360,Ross,How do you think that makes me feel Ned?!

7,Joey,Barbados!
8,Ross,"Ok, I gotta say."
9,Ross,"I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech!"
10,Ross,UH!
11,Ross,"And I've a surprise, uh..."
12,Ross,I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference!
13,Ross,That's right!
14,Ross,This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.
15,Rachel,Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
16,Chandler,"Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, ""island's stuff""."
17,Phoebe,I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.
18,Ross,"Oh, right, because he's a scientist!"
19,Phoebe,"No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die."
20,Ross,"Ok, we gotta go, yeah?"
21,Ross,"So, we'll see you guys tomorrow."
22,Joey,"All right, let's do it!"
23,Joey,"5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally."
24,Ross,"It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!"
25,Ross,Opening credits
26,Ross,Look at all these paleontologists!
27,Joey,"I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow!"
28,Joey,"I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!"
29,Joey,That... never happens...
30,Ross,Wow!
31,Ross,"This is very flattering, uh..."
32,Ross,"Uh, uh... Sure!"
33,Ross,"Uhm... ""Dear..."""
34,Ross,"""... Sarah."
35,Ross,"I dig you"", Uh?"

38,Ross,"I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani."
39,Joey,"No, God, no!"
40,Joey,No!
41,Joey,"No no, I'm an actor."
42,Joey,"You'd probably recognize me from a little show called ""The Days of Our Lives""."
43,Ross,"Dude, it's just ""Days of Our Lives""... there's no the."
44,Joey,"Ok, Ross!"
45,Joey,It's...
46,Joey,"It's fun, yeah!"
47,Joey,"No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray."
48,Joey,You don't own a TV?
49,Joey,What's all your furniture pointed at?
50,Monica,"David, can you help me?!"
51,Monica,I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
52,Monica,See?
53,Chandler,"Yeah, that's the same as ""it has something to do with wind""."
54,Monica,"Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip."
55,Phoebe,"Oh, I should go, too."
56,Phoebe,"Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there."
57,Phoebe,Mike??
58,Phoebe,Who's Mike?
59,Phoebe,That's right!
60,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah... Well, I've totally forgotten about im!"
61,Phoebe,AH!
62,Phoebe,That's-That's... a blast from the past!
63,Phoebe,"Really, it doesn't mean anything."
64,Phoebe,"I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!"
65,Chandler,She does?
66,Monica,Let's get you out of here!
67,Monica,At least you took me down with you!
68,Phoebe,I'm sooo sorry!!
69,Phoebe,I just...
70,Phoebe,I keep thinking about Mike!
71,Phoebe,"I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together."
72,Phoebe,Why-Why do I miss Mike?
73,Phoebe,"That's-that's gonna go away, right?"
74,Monica,"I guess, in time."
75,Phoebe,Yeah.
76,Monica,"I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone."
77,Phoebe,You just did it again.
78,Phoebe,"Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!"
79,Chandler,I wouldn't read too much into it.
80,Chandler,"David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going."
81,Chandler,I'm not very good at giving advice.
82,Chandler,"So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee."
83,Chandler,"Seriously, we're gonna do this?"
84,Chandler,"Oh, because his penis was too big."
85,Chandler,"Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do."
86,Chandler,They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married.
87,Chandler,"Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?"
88,Chandler,What?
89,Chandler,I didn't mean now...
90,Chandler,"Well, you're welcome!"
91,Chandler,Glad I could help.
92,Chandler,"David, I'm pretending to read here!"
93,Joey,Yeah!
94,Joey,How you doin'?
95,Joey,Yeah alright!
96,Joey,"Hey, hey!"
97,Joey,"You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?"
98,Joey,You really should have been more clear about that!
99,Ross,Hey!
100,Joey,Hey!
101,Ross,You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!
102,Joey,Oh!
103,Joey,ah!
104,Joey,eh... Britney Spears!
105,Ross,"Yeah, she never misses these conferences!"
106,Ross,"No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!"
107,Ross,Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?
108,Joey,You could
109,Ross,Ready to go?
110,Joey,Wha...?
111,Joey,You're gonna go now?
112,Joey,I thought we could hang out?
113,Ross,Yeah.
114,Joey,Will you wear a thong?
115,Joey,Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!
116,Ross,"I'm good, I have dinner plans ."
117,Joey,"Yeah, yeah."
118,Joey,I've got tons of stuff I could do.
119,Joey,"I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming..."
120,Ross,"Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?"
121,Joey,"No, why?"
122,Joey,Oh man!
123,Joey,"I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole!"
124,Monica,Wow!
125,Monica,That Mike thing was interesting!
126,Monica,I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
127,Chandler,I do!
128,Chandler,Want a hint?
129,Chandler,huh?
130,Chandler,"""I do""  ""I do""."
131,Monica,"Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee."
132,Chandler,David is going to propose to Phoebe.
133,Monica,What?
134,Monica,Why?
135,Chandler,"Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married."
136,Monica,"Chandler, we have talked about this."
137,Monica,You are not supposed to give people advice!
138,Monica,Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
139,Chandler,I did!
140,Chandler,A penis one!
141,Chandler,"Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?"
142,Monica,They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike!
143,Monica,"She'll say ""No"", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again."
144,Chandler,"Man, that's some bad advice!"
145,Joey,Oh!
146,Joey,Hey!
147,Joey,Thank God you guys are here!
148,Rachel,Hey!
149,Rachel,Hey what's going on?
150,Joey,Everything is upside down here!
151,Joey,"It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!"
152,Rachel,"Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!"
153,Monica,Ok!
154,Monica,"When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?"
155,Chandler,That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!
156,Joey,"Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in"
157,Monica,"Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!"
158,Phoebe,Oh!
159,Phoebe,"David, get one for us too!"
160,Phoebe,"Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one!"
161,Phoebe,And with mirrors on the ceiling!
162,Monica,And make sure our room isn't next to theirs .
163,Rachel,Ooh!
164,Rachel,"You guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place."
165,Rachel,"That's all, I just wish I could  share that with a guy."
166,Phoebe,Not Joey.
167,Rachel,"Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler."
168,Monica,"Yeah, right!"
169,Chandler,Tonight?!
170,Chandler,Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond?
171,Chandler,"Oh, there it is!"
172,Chandler,Nice!
173,Chandler,"Monica, can I talk to you for a sec?"
174,Monica,Ok!
175,Chandler,David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
176,Monica,See what happens when you give people advice?
177,Monica,I hope you told him not to?
178,Chandler,That would be advice!
179,Monica,Ok fine.
180,Monica,I'll handle this.
181,Monica,Phoebe?
182,Phoebe,Yeah?
183,Monica,I need to talk to you.
184,Phoebe,"Are you leaving ""The Supremes""?"
185,Phoebe,Wow?
186,Phoebe,Really?
187,Phoebe,That's fantastic!
188,Monica,What are you serious?
189,Monica,You wanna marry him?
190,Monica,Wha... What about Mike?
191,Phoebe,"Oh, ok, you want me to marry Mike?"
192,Phoebe,"Alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle."
193,Phoebe,I can just see
194,Monica,Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?
195,Phoebe,Sure!
196,Phoebe,"Look, ok, bottom"
197,Ross,"By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century."
198,Ross,"Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet."
199,Joey,Hey guys!
200,Ross,The chocolates aren't here yet.
201,Joey,Damnit!
202,Chandler,"Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?"
203,Ross,"If you want to check your email, just ask!"
204,Chandler,What?
205,Chandler,May I?
206,Rachel,"What's with the rain, Geller?"
207,Rachel,"I mean, when I signed up for Dino Week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season."
208,Rachel,It's not the time Charlie.
209,Chandler,"Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!"
210,Joey,"Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot?"
211,Joey,Oh!
212,Joey,Secret teapot?
213,Chandler,"Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!"
214,Ross,Wha... what do you mean?
215,Chandler,It must be a virus.
216,Chandler,I think it erased your hard drive.
217,Ross,"What, oh my God."
218,Ross,What did you do?
219,Chandler,Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
220,Ross,"Why, why would you open it?"
221,Chandler,"Well, it didn't say ""This is a virus""!"
222,Ross,What did it say?
223,Chandler,Nude... ... pictures of Anna Kournikova.
224,Chandler,I'm so sorry.
225,Ross,What... what am I gonna do?
226,Ross,"My speech is gone, Chandler!"
227,Chandler,It's not gone!
228,Chandler,"I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy."
229,Chandler,"You have a hard copy, right?"
230,Ross,NO!
231,Ross,I don't!
232,Chandler,"Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!"
233,Chandler,[Time
234,Joey,It's really gone?
235,Ross,Yep!
236,Ross,I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
237,Chandler,I just feel awful.
238,Ross,"Yeah, well you should!"
239,Ross,"I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova?"
240,Ross,"I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!"
241,Chandler,"Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but...  you know, you and Monica have the same ""I'm gonna kill you"" look...?"
242,Chandler,I can usually make it go away by kissing her...
243,Ross,Get out!
244,Rachel,"You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work."
245,Ross,"Well, what do you do?"
246,Rachel,"Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer."
247,Ross,I can't believe this.
248,Ross,I can't believe this is happening.
249,Ross,I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow!
250,Ross,Ok?
251,Ross,I have to stand up in front of all these people.
252,Ross,What am I gonna say?
253,Joey,I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.
254,Ross,"I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe!"
255,Ross,Wha... what you really think we can do that?
256,Joey,Hey don't worry about that!
257,Joey,"I mean, Ross needs you!"
258,Joey,And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.
259,Rachel,Ugh.
260,Ross,"Alright, ok, let's do it."
261,Ross,"Uhm, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello!"
262,Ross,"And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic."
263,Joey,"Oh, oh!"
264,Joey,"Any chance any of this happened in a ""Galaxy far, far away""?"
265,Monica,"Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole ""I never want to get married"" thing and step up!"
266,Monica,This is Monica!
267,Monica,I'm Phoebe's friend.
268,Monica,"Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say ""yes"" but I know she really wants to be with you!"
269,Monica,I...
270,Monica,"I'm sorry, did you say something?"
271,Monica,I can't hear through all this damned hair!
272,Monica,You don't tell me what to do!
273,Monica,I tell you what to do!
274,Monica,Just call her.
275,Monica,She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados.
276,Monica,"And while I've got you, you've got curly hair."
277,Monica,What do you do in humidity?
278,Monica,Damnit!
279,Monica,"Well, I hope you're happy!"
280,Chandler,Oooh!
281,Chandler,"I hope you're happy too, honey!"
282,Monica,"Phoebe is going to say ""Yes"" to David."
283,Monica,"See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!"
284,Chandler,"Phoebe is going to say ""yes""?"
285,Chandler,"That's, that's great!"
286,Monica,"No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!"
287,Chandler,And there's not chance that will work?
288,Monica,"No, I called him."
289,Monica,It's not gonna happen.
290,Chandler,Oooooooh!
291,Chandler,Meddler!
292,Chandler,Meddler!
293,Monica,"Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself."
294,Monica,"Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!"
295,Chandler,This vacation sucks!
296,Joey,I'm so bored!
297,Joey,"Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything."
298,Rachel,"Well, I've brought some books."
299,Rachel,We could read.
300,Joey,"Hey, it hasn't come to that yet."
301,Joey,Hey hey hey!
302,Joey,Don't mind if I do!
303,Joey,"Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?"
304,Rachel,We can't.
305,Rachel,We're not pharmacists!
306,Joey,"I know we're not, but  Frank Medeio and...  Eva Trorro... womba..."
307,Rachel,Kate Miller?
308,Joey,Kate Miller it is.
309,Rachel,And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
310,Joey,In that case should I make sure it's on real good?
311,Rachel,Thank you.
312,Ross,"Yeah, that's it?"
313,Ross,"Oh my God, we did it!"
314,Ross,"Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products."
315,Ross,"This is amazing, thank you, thank you so much."
316,Ross,That's a pretty necklace.
317,Ross,"Hey, what do you say we celebrate?"
318,Ross,Champagne?
319,Ross,"Oh my God, I love you."
320,Ross,"That's Ben, my son from my first marriage."
321,Ross,Yeah.
322,Ross,No.
323,Ross,"Oh, it was... it's complicated, you know?"
324,Ross,She... she was... eh... gay.
325,Ross,"Ok, odd thing to get excited about!"
326,Ross,Hey!
327,Ross,High-five!
328,Ross,My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year.
329,Ross,She didn't get any fitter.
330,Ross,I know!
331,Ross,"It's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know?"
332,Ross,"I mean, call, or leave a"
333,Ross,"And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?"
334,Ross,Me neither.
335,Joey,"Well, who knew?"
336,Joey,Pharmacists are fun.
337,Rachel,"I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home."
338,Joey,"Not enough pills in the world, Rach."
339,Joey,"What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?"
340,Rachel,"Well, let's see."
341,Rachel,"There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts..."
342,Joey,"But what about back home, anything going on there?"
343,Joey,Anybody you like?
344,Rachel,No.
345,Joey,"There it is, you're blushing!"
346,Rachel,"No, I'm not blushing, I'm sunburnt!"
347,Rachel,"From, you know, the rain."
348,Joey,You like someone.
349,Joey,Tell me who it is.
350,Joey,Who is it?
351,Rachel,No.
352,Joey,Tell me who it is.
353,Rachel,Joey!
354,Joey,Come on who?
355,Joey,Who do you like?
356,Joey,Tell me.
357,Joey,You're not getting away that easy.
358,Joey,"Who do you like, who?"
359,Rachel,"Joey, come on!"
360,Rachel,"It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen."
361,Joey,What?
362,Joey,Why not?
363,Joey,"Rach, who can you not get?"
364,Rachel,Oh!
365,Rachel,"Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is?"
366,Joey,"Yeah, who is that?"
367,Rachel,Do ya?
368,Joey,Yeah.
369,Joey,Ross and
370,Joey,"Right, of course."
371,Joey,"Hey, did you guys finish the speech?"
372,Ross,"Yep, we got it, we got it."
373,Ross,Thank you so much.
374,Joey,"Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who..."
375,Rachel,Later!
376,Rachel,La...
377,Joey,Yeah.
378,Rachel,"Ok. See you, bye."
379,Ross,Good night.
380,Joey,Night.
381,Joey,Ross and
382,Rachel,"Ok, good night!"
383,Monica,I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David.
384,Monica,She's clearly in love with Mike.
385,Chandler,"You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that."
386,Monica,"Oh my God, he's gonna do it now."
387,Monica,"Please, I cannot watch this, let's go."
388,Chandler,I think we have some time.
389,Chandler,Have you ever heard him talk?
390,Chandler,"""Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..."" Spit it out, David!"
391,Phoebe,"Sure, ok, yeah."
392,Phoebe,"Oh my God, Mike!"
393,Phoebe,"No, Mike's here."
394,Monica,IT'S THE HUMIDITY!
395,Phoebe,"What are you, what are you doing here?"
396,Monica,You're the most incredible woman I've ever met.
397,Monica,How can I lose you?
398,Monica,"Now, I don't actually have a ring..."
399,Chandler,"I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy."
400,Phoebe,No!
401,Phoebe,I love you.
402,Phoebe,But I never needed a proposal from you.
403,Phoebe,"I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future."
404,Phoebe,"David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry."
405,Phoebe,"Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong."
406,Phoebe,Yes!
407,Monica,BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING!
408,Monica,Alright?
409,Chandler,"Oh, ain't this nice?"
410,Chandler,"It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day."
411,Monica,I know
412,Rachel,Open your drapes!
413,Rachel,Open your drapes!
414,Chandler,I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
415,Monica,The sun is out!
416,Chandler,Hey!
417,Chandler,Remember when I had corneas?
418,Monica,"Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion."
419,Chandler,Ladies?
420,Chandler,Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
421,Rachel,Nooo!
422,Monica,Damn it!
423,Ross,"Walls are pretty thin, guys!"
424,Ross,Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
425,Rachel,"Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous!"
426,Ross,"Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently"
427,Chandler,Not to mention the cold sores.
428,Ross,And that's just the herbivores.
429,Ross,"I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big."
430,Ross,Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.
431,Chandler,Really?
432,Ross,"But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster  is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus..."
433,Joey,"He said ""erectus""!"
434,Joey,"No, he really said it."
435,Ross,... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...
436,Joey,Erectus?
437,Rachel,Homo.
438,Ross,... in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.
439,Ross,Thank you!
440,Ross,"Oh, thanks guys!"
441,Ross,Man with a bow
442,Ross,Oh!
443,Ross,Man with a bow
444,Ross,Ok... now... now we're just holding hands!
445,Rachel,All right!
446,Rachel,"Well, uh...  we're gonna hit the beach?"
447,Monica,Yeah!
448,Rachel,It was really... great!
449,Ross,"Oh, thank you so much!"
450,Joey,"Yeah, and so funny!"
451,Rachel,Oh!
452,Ross,Ok!...
453,Ross,"All right, thanks!"
454,Ross,"Thank you so much, you guys!"
455,Ross,"Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!"
456,Ross,Ok!...
457,Ross,Uh... excuse me?
458,Ross,Yeah?
459,Ross,Phoebe &
460,Ross,Hey!
461,Ross,Well...?
462,Ross,Yeah?
463,Ross,"Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face!"
464,Ross,"I mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me?"
465,Ross,"No, it's ok!"
466,Ross,Made me feel like a rock star!
467,Ross,I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
468,Ross,"Look, I took it too far!"
469,Monica,I can't believe it's raining again!
470,Monica,"Oh, it's so unfair!!"
471,Phoebe,"Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off."
472,Phoebe,Not you guys.
473,Phoebe,You got it going on!
474,Monica,"So, what are we gonna do today?"
475,Monica,Ping pong?
476,Monica,"Honey, they have ping pong!"
477,Monica,Let's play!
478,Chandler,I don't think so!
479,Monica,Why not?
480,Chandler,"Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!"
481,Monica,I'm not always that bad!
482,Chandler,"Oh, yeah?"
483,Chandler,What happened when we played last time?
484,Monica,I punched you...?
485,Chandler,And...?
486,Monica,... Phoebe...?
487,Phoebe,... and...?
488,Monica,I clunked your heads together!
489,Joey,Hey!
490,Joey,As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling!
491,Joey,"Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya!"
492,Joey,"Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it..."
493,Joey,"I'll do it alone, but..."
494,Joey,I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...
495,Joey,Hey!
496,Joey,Don't worry about it!
497,Joey,It was fine!
498,Joey,I ended up having the best time with Rachel!
499,Joey,"I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech..."
500,Joey,Oh!
501,Joey,"Oh, well!"
502,Joey,At least we're both having fun!
503,Joey,Yeah!
504,Joey,"A little bit, yeah..."
505,Joey,Yeah...
506,Joey,I think we do... ... about what?
507,Monica,"C'mon guys, it'll be fun!"
508,Phoebe,"All right, all right..."
509,Phoebe,I'll play if we don't keep score!
510,Monica,But then how do we know who wins?
511,Phoebe,Nobody wins!
512,Monica,"So, we're just four losers... SUPER!"
513,Chandler,I'm not playing with you.
514,Phoebe,"Yeah, I'm out."
515,Monica,OK!
516,Phoebe,"Mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing!"
517,Chandler,She gets crazy!
518,Chandler,This scar  is from Pictionary!
519,Monica,Sure!
520,Monica,Got to!
521,Monica,Aww!
522,Chandler,"Oh dear God, there's two of them!"
523,Monica,"Hell, yeah!"
524,Chandler,Did you know this about him?
525,Phoebe,No idea!
526,Phoebe,I though he was soft like you!
527,Monica,How much were you thinking?
528,Monica,Make it fifty!
529,Monica,One thousand...
530,Chandler,OK!
531,Monica,No...
532,Monica,Either of you girls got a quarter?
533,Chandler,"Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!"
534,Phoebe,"Monica, you call it."
535,Monica,Heads!
536,Monica,"No, Tails!"
537,Monica,He-he-heads!
538,Phoebe,Tails!
539,Monica,"Ow, what are the chances!"
540,Monica,Ha!
541,Monica,My point!
542,Phoebe,He was a lawyer!
543,Rachel,Oh!
544,Rachel,Weather bitch!
545,Rachel,It's open!
546,Rachel,"Hi, Joe!"
547,Joey,Hey...
548,Rachel,"What, is everything ok?"
549,Joey,Uh... Charlie and I broke up.
550,Rachel,"Nooooo, why?"
551,Joey,"Oh well, she said we have nothing in common."
552,Rachel,"Oh, that's crazy!"
553,Joey,"No, it's not, we have nothing in common!"
554,Rachel,"... yeah, it's true."
555,Joey,"I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross!"
556,Joey,"You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too!"
557,Joey,"Man, smart people are dull!"
558,Rachel,"What, hey!"
559,Joey,"Ok, Rach!"
560,Joey,"I feel so stupid, you know?"
561,Joey,Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?
562,Rachel,"W-What are you, what are you talking about?"
563,Joey,"Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like...  What the hell is my problem?"
564,Joey,OH!
565,Rachel,Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...
566,Joey,"I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!"
567,Rachel,"Yeah, I'm not talking about her..."
568,Joey,But then who?
569,Joey,The waitress I went out with last month?
570,Rachel,You know?
571,Rachel,Forget it!
572,Joey,"No-no-no-no, no!"
573,Joey,"Who, who were you talking about?"
574,Rachel,"No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about!"
575,Rachel,So!
576,Joey,Ok!
577,Joey,"All right, well..."
578,Joey,I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll...
579,Joey,I'll see you later!
580,Rachel,"Yeah, sure!"
581,Joey,You like me?
582,Rachel,"Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!"
583,Joey,That's a huge thing!
584,Rachel,"Not working with me, Joe!"
585,Rachel,Here's the
586,Joey,What... for how long?
587,Rachel,Only like a month!
588,Joey,A MONTH?
589,Rachel,What the...
590,Rachel,DIAL IT DOWN!
591,Rachel,"Listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do, I have, I've been thinking about... you know, us!"
592,Rachel,"Ok, dial it up a little!"
593,Joey,I just have one question!
594,Rachel,Shoot!
595,Joey,What the hell are you doin'??
596,Rachel,"I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know..."
597,Rachel,"I mean, aren't you just a... little curious...  what that would be like?..."
598,Joey,"Uh, am I curious?"
599,Joey,"I mean, I am as curious as... as..."
600,Joey,George!
601,Rachel,Who...?
602,Joey,CURIOUS GEORGE !
603,Joey,"You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!"
604,Rachel,"Oh yes, of course, I remember him!"
605,Joey,"Yeah, he had a paper route."
606,Rachel,"Yeah, he did!"
607,Rachel,"Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about!"
608,Joey,"No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen!"
609,Rachel,But can it... just... happen a little bit?
610,Joey,"NO, NO!"
611,Joey,It can't happen at all!
612,Rachel,"But why, why not?"
613,Joey,"Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok?"
614,Joey,I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no!
615,Joey,I couldn't do it to Ross!
616,Rachel,But that wasn't gonna stop you before!
617,Joey,"I know, I know!"
618,Joey,"But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right..."
619,Joey,I'm sorry...!
620,Rachel,"I'm sorry, too!"
621,Rachel,OH GOD!
622,Rachel,I shouldn't have said anything!
623,Joey,NO!
624,Joey,No-no-no-no-no-no!
625,Joey,Hey!
626,Joey,"Hey, we'll be fine!"
627,Joey,"Li... hey, like you"
628,Rachel,It's not a big deal!
629,Joey,NO BIG DEAL!
630,Rachel,It's so not a big deal!
631,Joey,Yeah!
632,Joey,I'll see ya later!
633,Joey,Yeah!
634,Rachel,Ok!
635,Rachel,"Ok, I..."
636,Rachel,AAAHHHH!
637,Monica,Ooh!
638,Monica,I'm sorry!
639,Monica,"I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!"
640,Monica,"Ah, yeah!"
641,Monica,"Ah, yeaaah!"
642,Monica,AH YEAAAAH!
643,Chandler,Do you really find this attractive on him?
644,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah!"
645,Phoebe,"Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now?"
646,Chandler,I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.
647,Phoebe,"C'mon Mike, you can beat her!"
648,Phoebe,Knock that dog off her head!
649,Monica,"Oh, damn it!"
650,Phoebe,I sleep with him!
651,Monica,Don't get too cocky!
652,Monica,Remember I won the last one!
653,Monica,"Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?"
654,Monica,"NO, NO, NOOO!"
655,Chandler,"Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life."
656,Chandler,So everybody goes home a winner.
657,Monica,Best out of three?
658,Chandler,Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
659,Monica,"Serve the ball, chump!"
660,Phoebe,"Ok Mike, better come back Mike, better come back."
661,Ross,"Ooh, well."
662,Ross,"Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man."
663,Ross,Get Out!
664,Ross,"Yes, please!"
665,Ross,"So, what's going on?"
666,Ross,"Oh my God, wh-what happened?"
667,Ross,I knew that was him!
668,Ross,"Hey, you ok?"
669,Ross,"Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here."
670,Ross,"Ok, gentlemen!"
671,Ross,Please!
672,Ross,Aren't we a little old for this?
673,Ross,"I mean, we're scientists, right?"
674,Ross,We're academics.
675,Ross,And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first.
676,Ross,"GO, GO, GO!"
677,Chandler,"Ok, look!"
678,Chandler,Enough is enough!
679,Monica,"No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!"
680,Chandler,"Monica, that was also true an hour ago!"
681,Chandler,"I mean, please, look at you!"
682,Chandler,"Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable!"
683,Chandler,"Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!"
684,Monica,I can't just walk away!
685,Monica,I've put in four hours!
686,Chandler,But...
687,Monica,Look!
688,Monica,You knew this about me when you married me!
689,Monica,You agreed to take me in sickness and in health.
690,Monica,"Well, this is my sickness!"
691,Chandler,What about the obsessive cleaning?
692,Monica,That's just good sense!
693,Monica,Aww!
694,Chandler,You ok?
695,Monica,"No, no, no."
696,Monica,"Honey, I'm ok."
697,Monica,Shake it off!
698,Monica,"Oh, no!"
699,Monica,"No shaking, no shaking!"

706,Monica,I lost!
707,Chandler,"No, you didn't."
708,Monica,What?
709,Chandler,Because I'm gonna play for ya.
710,Phoebe,You can't do that!
711,Phoebe,"Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister."
712,Monica,"Honey, you don't have to do this."
713,Chandler,"Yes, I do."
714,Chandler,"Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you."
715,Monica,But... you suck!
716,Chandler,"You're welcome, sweetheart."
717,Chandler,"All right Mike, let's get this over with."
718,Chandler,Sudden death.
719,Chandler,"Whoever wins this point, wins."

722,Phoebe,It's like watching porn!
723,Chandler,And that's... how... it's done!
724,Monica,Oh my God.
725,Monica,That was so amazing!
726,Monica,When did you  Hold on!
727,Monica,I almost forgot  loser!
728,Monica,When did you stop sucking?
729,Chandler,"I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!"
730,Monica,Why?
731,Chandler,I don't know.
732,Monica,This is so great!
733,Monica,Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
734,Chandler,That's why!
735,Ross,Hi.
736,Ross,Yeah.
737,Ross,"The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores."
738,Ross,"You know, we as a group are not the coolest."
739,Ross,I don't think they saw us.
740,Ross,Oh.
741,Ross,Can I... can I ask who?
742,Ross,"I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so..."
743,Ross,I'm sorry... we... we can't.
744,Ross,"I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea."

2,Rachel,"I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a  cantaloupe might hurt less."
3,Joey,"Oh, ehm...I'm...I'm rehearsing my lines.They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives."
4,Joey,It's the first time my character's got one.
5,Joey,"I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!"
6,Rachel,Woow!I haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!
7,Joey,"Yeah, that was a disappointment... Oh, hey!D'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I'm doing ok?"
8,Rachel,Are you serious?
9,Joey,"Yeah!Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again."
10,Rachel,"Hey, that was an honest mistake!"
11,Joey,Right!
12,Joey,"""Oh my God, is this the men's room?"
13,Joey,"Oh, I feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?"""

36,Chandler,Are you really that busy?
37,Monica,"Yeah, I'm sorry."
38,Monica,I really am.
39,Chandler,"Oh, that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule."
40,Chandler,"""Hi, this is Chandler Bing."
41,Chandler,"I made a reservation there and I need to change it  Oh, what do you mean it's not refundable?"

54,Ross,"Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!"
55,Monica,Why don't you take Ross?
56,Ross,"Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird?"
57,Ross,"I mean, two guys in a romantic inn..."
58,Monica,"No, not if their room has two beds!"
59,Ross,I guess...It still seems a little... moonlight boat ride!
60,Rachel,"Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?"
61,Joey,"I don't know, but one of the extras sure did!"
62,Joey,"Hey, listen Rach."
63,Joey,Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!

68,Joey,"Oh, wish me luck!"
69,Rachel,"Ok, not that you need it but good...GOD!Is that Chase Lassiter?He's straight, right?"

101,Chandler,"Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation."
102,Chandler,New York.
103,Ross,The big apple!
104,Chandler,"I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here."
105,Ross,"Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody."
106,Chandler,"Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?"
107,Ross,Check again please!
108,Ross,Not there.
109,Chandler,Let me get this straight.
110,Chandler,"I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?"
111,Ross,She doesn't know what to say!
112,Chandler,Just give us the cheapest room you have.
113,Chandler,That's insane!
114,Ross,Totally insane.
115,Ross,"Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves."
116,Chandler,Does that room have a closet I can lock him in?
117,Chandler,We'll take it.
118,Chandler,What!?
119,Chandler,They are totally ripping us off!
120,Ross,"Dude, don't worry 'bout it!"
121,Ross,I know how we can make your money back!
122,Ross,"This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those!"
123,Ross,Like those apples.
124,Ross,"Instead of taking one, I'm..."
125,Ross,I take six!
126,Chandler,"Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!"
127,Ross,"C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!"
128,Chandler,"Dude, you're shaking!"
129,Ross,"I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?"
130,Rachel,Hi!
131,Joey,Hey!
132,Rachel,"Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing!"
133,Joey,"Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me!"
134,Rachel,"God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!"
135,Joey,"Ow, I'm just going over the script now!"
136,Joey,You wanna read lines with me?
137,Rachel,Me?
138,Rachel,"Oh, no, I am not an actress."
139,Joey,"Oh, all right, I can ask Monica."
140,Rachel,"Oh screw her, that part is mine!"
141,Joey,"Right...  ok, so just from the top of the page, right here."
142,Rachel,Okay.
143,Rachel,"Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here."
144,Rachel,Joey/Drake
145,Rachel,Kiss me.
146,Joey,What?
147,Rachel,Kiss me.
148,Joey,"Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that!"
149,Rachel,"No, I'm saying..."
150,Joey,"but, but.."
151,Rachel,just... don't talk...
152,Rachel,"Ehhh, aw!"
153,Rachel,"Well, that's new!"
154,Ross,"Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206."
155,Ross,It seems you forgot a couple of things.
156,Ross,Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room?
157,Ross,Thank you!
158,Ross,"Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already?"
159,Ross,"Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons."
160,Ross,Ross
161,Chandler,USA Today
162,Ross,"Nice, put it with the others."
163,Chandler,And I also got... two more apples.
164,Ross,We are four short of a bush-o .
165,Ross,"God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!"
166,Chandler,I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
167,Ross,"Oh, that's not cool."
168,Chandler,"Dude, none of this is cool."
169,Ross,"No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you."
170,Ross,For
171,Chandler,"I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that."
172,Ross,"Not my first time in a hotel, my friend."
173,Chandler,"Ok, how about this ?"
174,Ross,"No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!"
175,Chandler,"Yes, but the batteries... Chandler"
176,Ross,Let's celebrate with some maple candy!
177,Chandler,No!
178,Ross,At least tell me where you hid it.
179,Rachel,Can I ask you a question?
180,Monica,Yeah.
181,Rachel,Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
182,Monica,Let me think.
183,Monica,"Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head."
184,Rachel,"Ok, well this is like that...in no way."
185,Rachel,I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.
186,Monica,"Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?"
187,Rachel,Oh yeah!
188,Rachel,"I mean, that was pretty intense."
189,Monica,What do you think brought than on?
190,Rachel,I don't know!
191,Rachel,"I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday."
192,Monica,A love scene?
193,Monica,With who?
194,Rachel,Olivia.
195,Monica,Olivia?
196,Monica,I thought she was marrying Connor!
197,Monica,"Oh right, real life more important."
198,Rachel,So do you think that my dream means anything?
199,Monica,I don't know.
200,Monica,"I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake."
201,Rachel,Ah!
202,Rachel,Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...
203,Monica,Of course it was!
204,Monica,"Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about."
205,Monica,I took two psych classes in college.
206,Rachel,You took the same class twice.
207,Monica,It was hard!
208,Monica,Phoebe
209,Monica,Hi.
210,Phoebe,"Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant  uh, huh wait!"
211,Phoebe,Right?
212,Phoebe,"I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man."
213,Monica,Oh...Phoebe?
214,Monica,Maybe I wasn't clear before.
215,Monica,"I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place."
216,Phoebe,"Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault."
217,Monica,"Phoebe, it's not what you wear."
218,Monica,It's sort of your songs...
219,Monica,I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.
220,Phoebe,"Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back ."
221,Phoebe,Rachel
222,Phoebe,My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?
223,Rachel,"Ok, we're still on that."
224,Monica,I didn't say your songs were not good enough.
225,Phoebe,Then what's wrong with them?
226,Phoebe,Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?
227,Monica,Tiny portions?
228,Phoebe,"Yeah well, ""excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but  I can't see it, I can't see it""!"
229,Monica,"Phoebe, it's not about quantity."
230,Phoebe,Well...it's not about quality.
231,Monica,"Oh really, you want to talk about quality?"
232,Monica,Have you heard of a key?
233,Monica,It's what some people sing in.
234,Phoebe,Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic.
235,Phoebe,"Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica."
236,Monica,"Ok, so that's what we're doing."
237,Monica,"You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs."
238,Phoebe,"Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?"
239,Monica,You know what?
240,Monica,I take back what I said before.
241,Monica,"You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy."
242,Phoebe,"What are people having, the garlic Martini?"
243,Chandler,"Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps."
244,Chandler,Chandler
245,Ross,"Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car."
246,Ross,We're way ahead of the game.
247,Ross,Ross
248,Chandler,What?
249,Ross,There's something new in the bowl.
250,Chandler,"Look, we have enough, just walk away."
251,Ross,"No, but I want...I want the pinecones!"
252,Chandler,There's a forest right outside.
253,Ross,It's not the same.
254,Chandler,"Ok, go quick!"
255,Chandler,Ross
256,Phoebe,Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you.. Monica
257,Phoebe,"You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself."
258,Monica,"Ok, you have to stop playing now."
259,Phoebe,Why?
260,Phoebe,The only person my playing is bothering is you!
261,Monica,Oh yeah?
262,Monica,"Ok, let's settle this, come on!"
263,Phoebe,Get your garlic-peelers off me!
264,Monica,"Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. .. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever!"
265,Monica,"Ok, quick"
266,Phoebe,"Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside?"
267,Phoebe,Ha!
268,Monica,"Alright, let me ask you this"
269,Phoebe,"Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?"
270,Monica,Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone?
271,Phoebe,"Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking?"
272,Monica,Excuse us!
273,Monica,Alright here's a
274,Phoebe,Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great!
275,Monica,I'm sorry...
276,Phoebe,I'm sorry too...
277,Monica,ooohh... hey!
278,Monica,Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?
279,Phoebe,Yeah!
280,Phoebe,As long as it's free!
281,Phoebe,Food here is ridiculously over-p...  Phoebe
282,Rachel,Hey!
283,Joey,Hey!
284,Rachel,"Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?"
285,Joey,Oh man!
286,Joey,I thought I got it all!
287,Rachel,How...how...?
288,Joey,"I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?"
289,Rachel,uh-huh
290,Joey,"And I couldn't find this little plastic thing  that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...?"
291,Joey,Turns out very!
292,Rachel,Wow...definitely just Drake...
293,Joey,What?
294,Rachel,What...how is it going with Drake?
295,Joey,Oh...I don't think it's going very well...
296,Rachel,What...that scene I saw was so good!
297,Joey,"Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow..."
298,Rachel,"Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?"
299,Joey,A little.
300,Joey,"Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia."
301,Rachel,So?
302,Joey,So...I've never played that!
303,Rachel,Ooh!
304,Rachel,"Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?"
305,Joey,Uh...well...just once...with you...
306,Rachel,Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?
307,Joey,What the hell are you talking about?
308,Rachel,"Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how  you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene."
309,Joey,Oh!
310,Joey,"ok, yeah, I think I can do that."
311,Joey,"Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me."
312,Rachel,"Joey, you never..you never talked about that before..."
313,Joey,"Well.. hey, you know what else I could use?"
314,Joey,"There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us!"
315,Joey,"And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know?"
316,Joey,"And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful...  and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you  but it was worth it just to be there looking at you."
317,Joey,Joey
318,Chandler,I got you something from Vermont!
319,Monica,Besides tampons and salt?
320,Monica,Ooh!
321,Monica,My God!
322,Monica,Maple candy!
323,Monica,That's so sweet of you.
324,Monica,That's weird...it's empty!
325,Monica,Ross
0,Chandler,Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
1,Chandler,"Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem."
2,Chandler,"Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'..."
3,Chandler,Yes please.
4,Chandler,He's a he?
5,Chandler,...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that.
6,Chandler,"I mean, is that ridiculous?"
7,Chandler,Can you believe she actually thought that?
8,Rachel,Um... yeah.
9,Rachel,"Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be..."
10,Chandler,You did?
11,Rachel,"Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not."
12,Chandler,Huh.
13,Chandler,"Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?"
14,Monica,I did.
15,Phoebe,"Yeah, I think so, yeah."
16,Joey,Not me.
17,Ross,"Nono, me neither."
18,Ross,"Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did."
19,Chandler,You're kidding!
20,Chandler,Did you tell her I wasn't?
21,Ross,No.
22,Ross,"No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so..."
23,Chandler,"Well, this is fascinating."
24,Chandler,"So, uh, what is it about me?"
25,Phoebe,"I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny..."
26,Chandler,"Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?"
27,Chandler,WHAT IS IT?
28,Monica,"Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality."
29,Chandler,"Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this."
30,Monica,Hello?
31,Monica,Hello?
32,Monica,Oh!
33,Monica,"Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome."
34,Rachel,Oh my God!

41,Rachel,Talking to Rome.
42,Rachel,I'm talking to Rome.
43,Monica,"Hey dad, what's up?"

45,Monica,"Ross, it's Nana."
46,Ross,"So, uh, how's she doing?"
47,Ross,Aunt

57,Monica,Oh God!
58,Monica,The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
59,Ross,Oh!
60,Ross,"...Yeah, they were gross."
61,Ross,"Oh, you know what I loved?"
62,Ross,Her Sweet 'n' Los.
63,Ross,How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
64,Ross,Mr.
65,Ross,She looks so small.
66,Monica,I know.
67,Ross,"Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now."
68,Monica,"G'bye, Nana."
69,Ross,"Bye, Nana."
70,Monica,Ross!
71,Monica,Mrs.
72,Ross,Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed?
73,Ross,"Well, she's not, quite.. Mrs."
74,Ross,"She's not- past, she's present, she's back."
75,Ross,Aunt
76,Ross,"I, uh, I'll go see."
77,Ross,Now she's passed.
78,Chandler,"I just have to know, okay."
79,Chandler,Is it my hair?
80,Rachel,"Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is."
81,Rachel,It's your hair.
82,Phoebe,"Yeah, you have homosexual hair."
83,Rachel,"So, um, did she..."
84,Ross,Twice.
85,Joey,Twice?
86,Phoebe,"Oh, that sucks!"
87,Joey,You guys okay?
88,Ross,"I dunno, it's weird."
89,Ross,"I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh..."
90,Phoebe,Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
91,Ross,"Nono, she's gone."
92,Monica,We checked.
93,Monica,A lot.
94,Phoebe,"Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes."
95,Phoebe,"Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know?"
96,Phoebe,Oh!
97,Phoebe,"And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know?"
98,Phoebe,...I miss her.
99,Rachel,Aw.
100,Rachel,"Hey, Pheebs, want this?"
101,Phoebe,Thanks!
102,Rachel,Sure.
103,Rachel,I just sharpened her this morning.
104,Joey,"Now, see, I don't believe any of that."
105,Joey,"I think once you're dead, you're dead!"
106,Joey,You're gone!
107,Joey,You're worm food!
108,Joey,"...So Chandler looks gay, huh?"
109,Phoebe,"Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie."
110,Ross,I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
111,Ross,Mrs.
112,Ross,I don't see why not.
113,Ross,Here's my retainer!
114,Monica,Dad!

123,Monica,Mr.
124,Chandler,"Hey, gorgeous."
125,Chandler,"No, nono, don't- don't worry about it."
126,Chandler,"Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake."

135,Chandler,Excuse me?
136,Chandler,You don't think I could get a Brian?
137,Chandler,Because I could get a Brian.

10,Phoebe,Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.
11,Phoebe,And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end.
12,Phoebe,And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.

181,Joey,"Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50."

183,Monica,"Well, my financially challenged friends,  I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY."
184,Joey,How come those?
185,Monica,"Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada."
186,Monica,And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.
187,Rachel,"What happened to uh, MEG."

198,Phoebe,"Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping."
199,Rachel,"Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?"
200,Phoebe,"I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone."
201,Phoebe,"What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned."
202,Phoebe,"Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'"
203,Joey,"Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it."
204,Phoebe,Ok.
205,Phoebe,"Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok."
206,Monica,DON'T...be too long with the phone.
207,Rachel,She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.
208,Joey,It's a woman.
209,Phoebe,So talk to her.
210,Joey,"Uhh, hello Miss Buffay."
211,Joey,I know where your dog is.
212,Joey,"I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours."
213,Joey,"Uh, goodbye."
214,Rachel,Why the voice.
215,Joey,Hard to say.
216,Chandler,Your cappucino sir.
217,Ross,Thank you.
218,Chandler,Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.
219,Ross,Absolutely.
220,Ross,How come it's not mixing with the water?
221,Joey,"Hey, this is ridiculous."
222,Joey,I'll tell you what.
223,Joey,"After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright."
224,Joey,"No problem, Joey's there."
225,Chandler,Ok.
226,Ross,No.
227,Chandler,No?
228,Ross,No.
229,Ross,Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee.
230,Ross,"Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'."
231,Ross,I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.
232,Chandler,"Alright, hang on a second there Custer."
233,Joey,"Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?"
234,Ross,"Yeah, sure."
235,Joey,By someone besides Monica?
236,Ross,No.
237,Ross,So what.
238,Ross,"So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life."
239,Ross,"Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'."
240,Chandler,"Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again?"
241,Chandler,"Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back."
242,Monica,I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
243,Rachel,What?
244,Monica,"Hi, welcome home."
245,Monica,I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
246,Rachel,For what?
247,Monica,I've gotta get back in the game.
248,Rachel,"Why, when did you get out of the game?"
249,Monica,"I don't know, I lost it all ok."
250,Monica,I lost it.
251,Rachel,Oh no.

253,Rachel,"Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry."

256,Monica,But I need it.
257,Monica,Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job.
258,Monica,"You know, with the dancing and the costumes."

294,Phoebe,"Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'"
295,Phoebe,That'll work too.
296,Phoebe,"Yeah, that'd be ok."
297,Phoebe,"Ok, I'm in the book."

3,Ross,Thought I'd take that bad boy out for a little spin.
4,Rachel,Wait a minute!
5,Rachel,"You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you're the only one who's allowed to drive it."
6,Monica,"Yeah, well he's my brother!"
7,Monica,And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
8,Ross,It's a car Monica!
9,Ross,Not a rocket ship!
10,Monica,Whatever Ross!
11,Monica,Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.
12,Joey,Hey!

14,Phoebe,Hey!
15,Joey,"Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin' good."

18,Phoebe,I've never driven it!
19,Phoebe,Okay?
20,Phoebe,Not once!
21,Phoebe,Okay once.
22,Phoebe,"Okay, I drive it all the time."
23,Monica,Nice work everybody!
24,Monica,"So much for the y'know, ""You can drive it, but don't tell Rachel"" plan!"
25,Rachel,Wow!
26,Rachel,I can't believe you lied to me.
27,Phoebe,"Okay, I can fix this!"
28,Phoebe,"Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding."
29,Monica,Great!
30,Monica,"Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver."
31,Monica,There!
32,Monica,That wasn't about the wedding.
33,Ross,Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
34,Joey,"Yeah, you got a couple hours?"
35,Joey,Opening Credits

37,Ross,That was a brisk ride!
38,Rachel,Take the top down did ya?
39,Ross,Only way to fly.
40,Rachel,Come on Ross give me the keys!
41,Rachel,Monica does not know what she's talking about!
42,Rachel,I am an excellent driver!
43,Ross,You're fast and irresponsible.
44,Ross,That adds up to a bad driver.
45,Rachel,"Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader."
46,Ross,Did you see the look that girl just gave me?
47,Ross,Huh?
48,Ross,She must've seen me cruising in the bad boy.
49,Rachel,I think she's checking out your beehive Ross.
50,Ross,What?!
51,Ross,Give-give me a brush.
52,Rachel,Gimme the keys!
53,Ross,No way!
54,Rachel,Well no brush!
55,Ross,Fine!
56,Ross,Y'know what?
57,Ross,"It doesn't matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom."
58,Rachel,Alimony.
59,Monica,"Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad."
60,Chandler,Oh!
61,Chandler,Right.
62,Chandler,"Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation."
63,Monica,Chandler!
64,Monica,He's your father; he should be at the wedding.
65,Chandler,I don't even know the man.
66,Chandler,Okay?
67,Chandler,We're not the close.
68,Chandler,I haven't seen him in years.
69,Monica,Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?
70,Chandler,Well he doesn't have to know!
71,Chandler,It's not like we run in the same circles.
72,Chandler,"I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas."
73,Phoebe,"Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles."
74,Chandler,"Trust me, you don't want him there either."
75,Chandler,Okay?
76,Chandler,Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
77,Monica,So what!
78,Monica,As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil I don't care.
79,Phoebe,"Okay, I think I need to do some shopping."
80,Rachel,Ahhh!
81,Rachel,"Ooh, nice!"
82,Rachel,My God!
83,Ross,What do you think you're doing?
84,Rachel,Just washing the windshield.
85,Ross,There is no way I am letting you drive this car!
86,Ross,So why don't you just hand over the keys?
87,Rachel,Oh.
88,Rachel,{Transcriber's

118,Joey,How long have you been going out?
119,Joey,Wow!
120,Joey,"Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better."
121,Joey,"So uh, what's your name?"
122,Joey,Joey.
123,Joey,"Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?"
124,Joey,Me too!
125,Joey,There's a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
126,Monica,Here!
127,Chandler,What's this?
128,Monica,It's your suitcase.
129,Monica,We're going to Las Vegas.
130,Chandler,Are you serious?!
131,Chandler,I mean like eloping?!
132,Chandler,No more stupid wedding stuff?!
133,Chandler,No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowersThink of the money we'll save!!
134,Chandler,We're not eloping.
135,Chandler,I love the flowers.
136,Chandler,Can our wedding be bigger please?
137,Monica,We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad.
138,Monica,"It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law."
139,Chandler,Y'know we already went over this and I won!
140,Monica,No you didn't.
141,Monica,"Oh and honey just so you know, now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore."
142,Chandler,Look forget it okay?
143,Chandler,I don't want to go.
144,Chandler,I don't want to see him.
145,Chandler,I don't wanna.
146,Monica,"Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you."
147,Monica,I know
148,Chandler,"No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through."
149,Chandler,"When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet."
150,Chandler,Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen.
151,Chandler,You're skinny.
152,Chandler,You're wearing speedoesThat your mom promised that you would grow into!
153,Chandler,And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda.
154,Chandler,We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
155,Monica,"Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on!"
156,Monica,Okay?
157,Monica,"That's a, that's a pretty great dad."
158,Chandler,He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
159,Monica,Who's Mr. Girabaldi?
160,Chandler,Does it matter?
161,Monica,"Chandler, you're not fourteen anymore."
162,Monica,Okay?
163,Monica,Maybe it's time that you let that stuff go.
164,Monica,If your father's not at your weddingyou're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
165,Chandler,"Yeah o-okay, but I'm just doing this for you."
166,Monica,Yes!
167,Chandler,So I really never get to win anymore?
168,Monica,How much did ever really win before?
169,Joey,Pheebs!
170,Phoebe,Hey!
171,Joey,"Listen, you know how uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?"
172,Phoebe,Yeah!
173,Joey,"Well, when Jake did it I saw thathe was wearing women's underwear!"
174,Phoebe,I know.
175,Phoebe,They were mine.
176,Joey,Oh.
177,Joey,No!
178,Joey,"No wait, that's weird!"
179,Phoebe,"No, it's not!"
180,Phoebe,We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
181,Joey,That's weird!
182,Phoebe,I'm wearing his briefs right now.
183,Joey,That'skinda hot.
184,Phoebe,I think so too.
185,Phoebe,And that little flap?
186,Phoebe,Great for holding my lipstick.
187,Joey,"Yeah, I wouldn't know about that."
188,Phoebe,And!
189,Phoebe,Y'know what Jake says?
190,Phoebe,That women's underwear is actually more comfortable.
191,Phoebe,And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
192,Joey,"Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!"
193,Phoebe,There is nothing wrong with Jake!
194,Phoebe,Okay?
195,Phoebe,He is all man!
196,Phoebe,I'm thinking even more than you.
197,Joey,"Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys."
198,Phoebe,I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear!
199,Phoebe,I don't think you could ever do that.
200,Joey,Hey!
201,Joey,I am secure with my masculinity.
202,Phoebe,Okay whatever.
203,Joey,You've seen my huge stack of porn right?
204,Rachel,God.
205,Rachel,I forgot how much I love driving.
206,Rachel,I have got to get my license renewed.
207,Ross,You don't have a valid driver's licenseOkay that is it!
208,Ross,Pull over right now!
209,Rachel,Oh Ross you're so tense!
210,Rachel,You just gotta relax okay?
211,Rachel,Just need to relax all right?
212,Rachel,Just need to relax
213,Ross,What-what are you doing?!
214,Ross,Are youOkay that's not funny!
215,Ross,Just stop horsing around!
216,Rachel,I am not horsing around okay?
217,Rachel,I am Porsching around.
218,Rachel,Uh-oh.
219,Ross,"Okay, stay calm."
220,Ross,"Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble."
221,Rachel,Really?
222,Rachel,You think so?
223,Ross,I was talking to myself!
224,Ross,You're going down!
225,Monica,"Uh oh yeah, she did."
226,Monica,"Uh, he did."
227,Monica,She?
228,Monica,I'm-I'm sorry I'm new.
229,Monica,I don't Waiter in
230,Chandler,"Yeah, I just ordered a beer!"
231,Chandler,Waiter in
232,Monica,I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.
233,Chandler,No!
234,Chandler,No!
235,Chandler,I don't want him to know we're yet!
236,Chandler,I'm not sure I'm ready for that.
237,Chandler,And besides he's not gonna be too happy to see me either.
238,Monica,Why not?
239,Chandler,"I don't know if I've told you this, but he's kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years"
240,Monica,What?
241,Chandler,"Yeah, he's made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him."
242,Chandler,Y'know it's all very Cats in the CradleI don't want to get into it.
243,Chandler,Here we go.
244,Chandler,And there's daddy!
245,Chandler,Commercial Break
246,Rachel,Okay.
247,Rachel,Switch places with me!

250,Rachel,"I'll go under, you go over!"
251,Ross,"Yeah, I'll get right on that."
252,Rachel,Oh come on Ross!
253,Ross,No Rach!
254,Ross,Come on!
255,Ross,No-no!
256,Ross,"Yeah, I'm sure we won't get arrested for this."
257,Rachel,"Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?"
258,Ross,Oh my God.
259,Rachel,"Oh yes, absolutely!"
260,Rachel,"Y'know, it's weird uh, but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman."
261,Rachel,And then he uhwell I probably shouldn't tell you the rest.
262,Rachel,Yes.
263,Rachel,"Here you go Officer uh, Handsome."
264,Rachel,"Oops sorry, my mistake."
265,Ross,Dear Lord!
266,Ross,Here it comes.
267,Rachel,Really?!
268,Rachel,You think so?
269,Rachel,"Y'know, I had just rolled out of bed."
270,Ross,"Well she should, it was taken ten years ago!"
271,Rachel,Y'know you're-you're probably wondering about the old date on there.
272,Rachel,Yeah.
273,Rachel,I bet you're a Gemini.
274,Rachel,Taurus?
275,Rachel,Virgo?
276,Rachel,Sagittarius?
277,Rachel,I knew it!
278,Rachel,"I knew it, ahh."
279,Rachel,Yeah?
280,Rachel,I won't speed.
281,Rachel,I promise.
282,Rachel,Yeah!
283,Rachel,Oh well
284,Ross,I can handle the stick!
285,Monica,That can't be your father.
286,Chandler,"Believe me, I've been saying that for years."
287,Chandler,Oh my God!
288,Monica,What?
289,Chandler,That's Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
290,Chandler,He's coming into the audience.
291,Chandler,He's coming into the audience.
292,Monica,Relax!
293,Monica,You'll be fine.
294,Monica,Oh much better.
295,Monica,You're invisible now.
296,Chandler,It can't happen like this.
297,Chandler,Okay?
298,Chandler,I'll meet you back at the hotel.

311,Joey,Feels really good!
312,Phoebe,Huh.

371,Joey,"Y'know, you look familiar."
372,Joey,Do I know you from somewhere?
373,Joey,Oh!
374,Joey,Maybe it's because I'm on television.
375,Joey,I'm an actor on Days of Our Lives.
376,Joey,Yeah.

19,Ross,The flirting!
20,Ross,"Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?"
21,Chandler,I was not flirting.
22,Ross,It was totally flirting.
23,Ross,"""Somebody got a haircut """
24,Chandler,"Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny."
25,Chandler,"And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people."
26,Chandler,That is all.
27,Ross,"Yeah, right."
28,Chandler,You wanna see flirting?
29,Chandler,I'll show you flirting.
30,Ross,I'm good.
31,Ross,Opening Credits
32,Rachel,"I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!"
33,Phoebe,I know.
34,Phoebe,But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
35,Rachel,No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
36,Phoebe,Don't get me started on that.
37,Chandler,I was not flirting.
38,Ross,"And on your anniversary, for shame!"
39,Rachel,What's going on?
40,Ross,Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
41,Chandler,"I was not and oh God, shh!"
42,Ross,Well I'm sorry but you were!
43,Ross,Okay?
44,Ross,"And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it."
45,Phoebe,Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
46,Ross,Well
47,Chandler,Is that what this is about?
48,Chandler,You like Caitlin?
49,Rachel,Ross!
50,Rachel,We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then.
51,Rachel,I think it's okay that we see other people.
52,Ross,"Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place."
53,Rachel,Hm-mmm.
54,Ross,And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little
55,Rachel,"Okay, y'know what?"
56,Rachel,We don't need her measurements.
57,Phoebe,"Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?!"
58,Phoebe,She forgot my vegetarian!
59,Ross,This is perfect!
60,Ross,"She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross."
61,Ross,Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.
62,Phoebe,See?
63,Phoebe,Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
64,Joey,"Hey everybody, look who's here!"
65,Joey,You remember my grandmother!
66,Rachel,Big night!
67,Phoebe,This is so cool!
68,Chandler,"So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!"
69,Joey,"Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English."
70,Chandler,"I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother."
71,Chandler,I've done it again.
72,Joey,She's my biggest fan.
73,Joey,"Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me."
74,Joey,"Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so"
75,Monica,Hey!
76,Monica,Happy Anniversary!
77,Chandler,"Happy Anniversary, 10 months!"
78,Monica,"So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London"
79,Chandler,"Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there."
80,Monica,Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
81,Chandler,The one that doesn't.
82,Monica,That was some hot love you gave me!
83,Monica,I'm gonna go get ready.
84,Chandler,"Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?"
85,Monica,That's a great idea!
86,Monica,I was saving them for something special.
87,Chandler,Okay.
88,Monica,You have got to go home!
89,Phoebe,But I like it here!
90,Monica,You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay?
91,Monica,Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
92,Phoebe,"Okay, well I think that they're in my purse."
93,Phoebe,Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them.
94,Monica,Great!
95,Phoebe,Okay!
96,Phoebe,"Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed."
97,Rachel,"Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back."
98,Joey,"Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?"
99,Phoebe,I guess so.
100,Rachel,Here you go.
101,Rachel,Thank you!
102,Phoebe,"Wait, Rach!"
103,Phoebe,Where's the other one?
104,Rachel,"Oh what, you-you want both of them?"
105,Phoebe,"Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?"
106,Rachel,"Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it."
107,Rachel,"I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it."
108,Phoebe,"Well, what am I going to tell Monica?"
109,Phoebe,She wants to wear them tonight!
110,Rachel,Tell her to wear her own earrings.
111,Phoebe,These are her earrings.
112,Rachel,Nooo!
113,Rachel,Nooooo!
114,Rachel,You lent me Monica's earrings?!
115,Rachel,I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
116,Phoebe,Why not?
117,Rachel,Because I lose her stuff!
118,Joey,"Okay, see that blind guy right there?"
119,Joey,I'm gonna bash his head in later.
120,Joey,"Oh umm, my big scene is coming up."
121,Joey,Big scene coming up.
122,Chandler,"If you said, ""Big lima bean, bubbling up."""
123,Chandler,Would she understand the difference?
124,Monica,Rach?
125,Monica,What are you doing?
126,Rachel,"Oh boy, I just can't watch."
127,Rachel,It's too scary!
128,Monica,It's a diaper commercial.
129,Rachel,"Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!"
130,Ross,I'll get it!
131,Ross,I will get that!
132,Ross,Hi!
133,Ross,Oh.
134,Ross,"Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better."
135,Ross,I happen to like 8-year-old boys.
136,Ross,"The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it."
137,Ross,The hair.
138,Ross,You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
139,Chandler,Here you go.
140,Chandler,Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
141,Chandler,You're welcome.
142,Ross,"You couldn't let me have her, could ya?"
143,Chandler,What?
144,Ross,This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!
145,Monica,What's goin' on?
146,Ross,Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
147,Chandler,Thank you for that!
148,Chandler,I was not flirting.
149,Monica,It's okay.
150,Monica,I don't care.
151,Monica,"It's uh, it's fine."
152,Ross,Really?
153,Chandler,Really?
154,Monica,"It's no big deal, I do it all the time."
155,Chandler,"So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?"
156,Monica,Sure!
157,Monica,It doesn't mean anything!
158,Monica,Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
159,Chandler,"Okay, but there is a big difference."
160,Chandler,You are a lot hotter than I am.
161,Joey,True story!
162,Monica,"Chandler, this actually bothers you?"
163,Chandler,"Yes, it does bother me!"
164,Chandler,And I think it would bother a lot of people.
165,Chandler,"Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?"
166,Rachel,"Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women."
167,Ross,"And thank you, for that."
168,Rachel,"But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about."
169,Rachel,Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
170,Ross,What?
171,Ross,"What-what, what are talking about?"
172,Ross,It-it worked with you.
173,Rachel,Oh!
174,Rachel,Y'know what?
175,Rachel,You're right!
176,Rachel,"We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!"
177,Ross,"All right, all right."
178,Ross,You-you-you know what I'm going to do?
179,Ross,"I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt."
180,Ross,Yeah!
181,Ross,"I will, I will get her phone number!"
182,Ross,And not the one on the menu!
183,Phoebe,I found it!
184,Rachel,Ohh!
185,Rachel,Thank God!
186,Rachel,Where was it?
187,Phoebe,On your dresser.
188,Rachel,Okay that is the one we already have!
189,Joey,"Okay, here's my big scene."
190,Joey,My big scene's here!
191,Joey,Oh my God.
192,Monica,What?
193,Joey,"Okay, everybody just keep smiling."
194,Joey,It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
195,Chandler,"Well, what is it?"
196,Joey,"Oh, they cut me out of the show."
197,Rachel,What?
198,Ross,Are you sure?
199,Phoebe,Maybe your scene's coming up?
200,Joey,Not likely.
201,Joey,'Cause you see that body bag right there
202,Rachel,Yeah.
203,Joey,I'm in it.
204,Joey,Commercial Break
205,Phoebe,"This is terrible, what are you going to do?"
206,Joey,I don't know.
207,Joey,"This little, old lady lives for my career."
208,Joey,When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.
209,Phoebe,That's not good.
210,Joey,"No, smile!"
211,Joey,"Not that face, smile!"
212,Joey,Everybody smile!
213,Rachel,"Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened?"
214,Rachel,It's not your fault.
215,Chandler,"If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?"
216,Chandler,Grandma
217,Joey,"Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon."
218,Joey,There I am!
219,Joey,Grandma
220,Joey,"No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me."
221,Joey,Grandma
222,Chandler,"Doesn't know, ""Hello."""
223,Chandler,But she knows Capricorn One.
224,Monica,Phoebe!
225,Monica,"I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over."
226,Phoebe,But I already gave them back to you!
227,Monica,No you didn't.
228,Phoebe,"All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said."
229,Phoebe,Where is that other earring?
230,Rachel,"It's not here Pheebs, it's not here."
231,Rachel,"Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night!"
232,Rachel,Okay!
233,Phoebe,Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
234,Rachel,Wait a minute.
235,Rachel,Chandler has a jewelry box?
236,Phoebe,"Okay, we have like ten minutes."
237,Phoebe,Do you want me to get into that now?
238,Ross,Hey Pheebs!
239,Ross,"How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya?"
240,Ross,"You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?"
241,Phoebe,Why are you being weird?
242,Ross,Do you like it?
243,Phoebe,"No, that would be, ""Why are you being cute?"""
244,Ross,"Okay, I'm working on my flirting."
245,Phoebe,Ohh!
246,Phoebe,I did not get that.
247,Chandler,"So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?"
248,Monica,"Yeah, it's good."
249,Chandler,"See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!"
250,Monica,Chandler!
251,Monica,"Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me."
252,Chandler,"Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up."
253,Chandler,"Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women."
254,Monica,"Go on, teach me something about men and women."
255,Chandler,"Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever."
256,Chandler,"See when you flirt with a guy you think, ""I'm just flirting, no big deal."""
257,Chandler,"But the guy is thinking, ""Finally!"
258,Chandler,"Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"""
259,Monica,No way!
260,Chandler,It's true.
261,Monica,Well that's pathetic!
262,Chandler,Again true.
263,Monica,And this goes for all guys?
264,Chandler,All guys that are awake.
265,Chandler,Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
266,Joey,"All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!"
267,Ross,Joey!
268,Ross,This is like the last commercial.
269,Ross,You've got like  ten minutes left!
270,Joey,"I know, I know!"
271,Joey,What am I going to do?
272,Joey,Ooh!
273,Monica,No!
274,Monica,You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
275,Joey,"Yeah, all right."
276,Joey,Ooh!
277,Joey,Grandma
278,Chandler,"Uh, Joey is gonna be right back."
279,Chandler,Right back!
280,Chandler,"Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you."
281,Chandler,"So, you're old and small."
282,Rachel,Hey!
283,Phoebe,Did you find it?
284,Rachel,The earring?
285,Rachel,No.
286,Rachel,"But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch!"
287,Rachel,I've been looking for these since like last summer.
288,Phoebe,"Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me."
289,Rachel,"Okay, calm down, here they are."
290,Monica,Phoebe!
291,Phoebe,What are we going to do?
292,Rachel,"I don't know, I don't know."
293,Phoebe,"All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all."
294,Rachel,"Oh gosh, she's going to kill me."
295,Phoebe,I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
296,Rachel,Ohh that'd be great!
297,Phoebe,"Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?"
298,Monica,"Yeah, what is it?"
299,Phoebe,"Umm, I lost one of your earrings."
300,Phoebe,I'm sorry!
301,Phoebe,"I am so, so sorry!"
302,Monica,Wow!
303,Monica,"All right well, I mean, what can you do?"
304,Monica,If you lost it you lost it.
305,Phoebe,"I will replace it, I promise."
306,Phoebe,I feel so terrible.
307,Monica,"All right, sweetie that's fine."
308,Monica,You didn't do it on purpose.
309,Phoebe,No.
310,Monica,Look at you!
311,Monica,Come here!
312,Monica,Feel better?
313,Phoebe,Yeah!
314,Phoebe,You're the best!
315,Rachel,"Okay, wait a minute."
316,Rachel,"Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this."
317,Rachel,"Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault."
318,Rachel,"She lent me the earrings, and I lost it."
319,Rachel,I'm so sorry.
320,Rachel,"Honey, I feel terrible too."
321,Monica,That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!!
322,Monica,Okay?!
323,Monica,"I mean, first it's my jewelry!"
324,Monica,"And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater!"
325,Monica,"And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!"
326,Rachel,Your sunglasses?
327,Monica,Yes!
328,Phoebe,"Oh, right!"
329,Ross,"Oh, mine!"
330,Ross,Mine!
331,Ross,Mine!
332,Ross,"Okay, here goes."
333,Ross,Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
334,Chandler,"Okay, hold on."
335,Chandler,Okay.
336,Rachel,"Honey, you have nothing to prove."
337,Rachel,"And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to"
338,Ross,You'll see.
339,Ross,Okay.
340,Ross,"Oh, what's-what's her name?"
341,Ross,Hey!
342,Ross,"Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this."
343,Ross,"Okay,  so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh, wood-burning ovens?"
344,Ross,Gas?
345,Ross,Wow!
346,Ross,Intense.
347,Chandler,"If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem."
348,Ross,"Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?"
349,Ross,They put that in.
350,Ross,"The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak."
351,Ross,A lot of other gas smells
352,Chandler,Oh the humanity.
353,Ross,Meth-methane smells
354,Ross,Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
355,Ross,Was I talking to her about gas?
356,Chandler,More so than anything else.
357,Phoebe,I-I-I found it interesting.
358,Rachel,I'm sorry.
359,Ross,"Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it!"
360,Ross,"In nine years, she and I will be right there."
361,Rachel,"Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes."
362,Phoebe,Ross?
363,Ross,Yeah?
364,Phoebe,What else do they add smell too?
365,Rachel,Hey!
366,Rachel,Hey!
367,Rachel,Hi!
368,Rachel,"Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel!"
369,Rachel,From upstairs?
370,Rachel,The ones with all the pizza?
371,Rachel,No.
372,Rachel,No.
373,Rachel,Every thing's--they're fine.
374,Rachel,Great pizza.
375,Rachel,"But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross."
376,Rachel,"He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting."
377,Rachel,Yeah.
378,Rachel,"I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person."
379,Rachel,Yeah.
380,Rachel,"I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart."
381,Rachel,"And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you."
382,Rachel,"Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?"
383,Rachel,Hey Ross?
384,Rachel,"Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought."
385,Ross,What do you mean?
386,Rachel,"Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number."
387,Ross,And she just gave you this?
388,Rachel,Yeah!
389,Ross,"Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors."
390,Rachel,I-I-I didn't!
391,Rachel,I didn't!
392,Rachel,She thought you were cute.
393,Ross,Well that I can believe.
394,Rachel,Yay!
395,Joey,Hey!
396,Joey,Is the show still on?
397,Chandler,Almost over man.
398,Joey,Look!

405,Joey,I'm not afraid to use it!
406,Joey,Grandma
407,Joey,That's right!
408,Chandler,You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
409,Joey,"Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars."
410,Joey,Choo!
411,Joey,Choo!

413,Joey,"Filled with $100,000 in small bills, and if I don't get it Choo!!"

68,Joey,"What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right?"
69,Joey,"Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell."
70,Joey,Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
71,Chandler,What if Joey were president?
72,Phoebe,"Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?"
73,Rachel,Yeah.
74,Phoebe,"Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?"
75,Rachel,"Oh, ah with who?"
76,Phoebe,"Umm, my friend, Bonnie."
77,Phoebe,"She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren't together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you're not cool with it..."
78,Rachel,"Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?"
79,Phoebe,You remember her from my birthday party two years ago.
80,Phoebe,"She's yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald..."
81,Rachel,Oh!
82,Rachel,That's fine.
83,Phoebe,Great!
84,Phoebe,"Okay, good for you!"
85,Monica,Hi!
86,Monica,"Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous."
87,Monica,"I-I don't want you to get hurt, cause I kinda like you."
88,Monica,Promise me you'll be careful.
89,Monica,"Hey, are we still on for tonight?"
90,Monica,"Okay, good, cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own..."
91,Monica,How bout just a boom?
92,Rachel,"Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame."
93,Rachel,Ready to go to the movies?
94,Phoebe,Um-hmm.
95,Phoebe,Oh wait!
96,Phoebe,This is Bonnie.
97,Rachel,This is Bonnie?
98,Rachel,This is Bonnie?
99,Rachel,You're Bonnie?
100,Rachel,"Oh no, I'm sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you."
101,Rachel,"Oh, that must be it."
102,Phoebe,Well I hope you have fun tonight.
103,Rachel,You said she was bald.
104,Phoebe,"Yeah, she was bald, she's not now."
105,Rachel,How could you not tell me that she has hair?
106,Phoebe,"I don't know, I hardly ever say that about people."
107,Rachel,"Ohh, well, this is just perfect!"
108,Phoebe,"Well I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay."
109,Rachel,"Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick."
110,Rachel,"I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!"
111,Phoebe,"Well, maybe it won't work out."
112,Phoebe,Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
113,Rachel,"Why, does she have a bad personality?"
114,Phoebe,"Oh no, Bonnie's the best!"
115,Chandler,What is with him?
116,Chandler,"Well, that's not true, he-he smacked you once."
117,Chandler,No sir.
118,Ross,Hey!
119,Monica,"God Ross, what is that?"
120,Ross,"Yeah, it's the Ultimate Fighting Combo."
121,Ross,"Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup."
122,Ross,Yay!
123,Monica,"I love you, Pete!!"
124,Monica,Pete!
125,Monica,Pete!!
126,Monica,That guy's pretty huge!
127,Ross,"Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble."
128,Ross,All right!
129,Ross,You go get him!
130,Ross,Let's go!
131,Monica,Hey!
132,Monica,It's me.
133,Monica,Mon-i-ca!
134,Monica,Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.
135,Monica,"I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it."
136,Monica,And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
137,Monica,"Well, you're not gonna get going are you?"
138,Monica,"Well, no."
139,Monica,But...
140,Monica,That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
141,Monica,You didn't know that already?
142,Monica,"Okay, just get a lot better."
143,Monica,Fast.
144,Monica,Yeah.
145,Monica,That-that was the problem.
146,Monica,Hey.
147,Ross,Hey!
148,Ross,How long until Pete's fight?
149,Monica,"Oh, about five minutes."
150,Monica,Right now they're interviewing his opponent.
151,Monica,Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
152,Ross,Hot dog?
153,Monica,"Four, please."
154,Monica,I'm really nervous.
155,Monica,Thank you.
156,Phoebe,"So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?"
157,Ross,What?
158,Ross,Oh!
159,Ross,"I gotta tell you, I-I wasn't expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific."
160,Phoebe,"Ohh, that's too bad!"
161,Ross,"No, I-I'm saying I liked her."
162,Phoebe,"Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea."
163,Ross,"Pheebs, I think she's great."
164,Ross,Okay?
165,Ross,We're going out again.
166,Phoebe,"Okay, I hear you!"
167,Phoebe,Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
168,Chandler,Hey!
169,Chandler,Which one's my turkey burger?
170,Ross,"Ahh, the one next to my foot."
171,Ross,Sorry.
172,Joey,"Hey, the fight's starting!"
173,Ross,"Okay, we'll be right in."
174,Ross,"So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?"
175,Chandler,Nine times!
176,Chandler,"Okay, I had to put on lotion!"
177,Chandler,"But, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I'm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free."
178,Joey,Fight's over!
179,Chandler,"Excuse me, Doug?"
180,Chandler,Hey there sports fan!
181,Chandler,"No, I ah, I didn't do them."
182,Chandler,"No, no I just ah, didn't do them."
183,Chandler,"Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise."
184,Chandler,Doug!
185,Chandler,I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
186,Chandler,"No, no."
187,Chandler,"It-it's not about the swearing, it's more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock."
188,Chandler,"Oh, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment."
189,Chandler,"It's just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous."
190,Chandler,Okay.
191,Chandler,Ahhhhh!
192,Phoebe,Okay.
193,Phoebe,"Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?"
194,Rachel,Oh my God!
195,Rachel,"Phoebe look, it's Ross and that girl."
196,Phoebe,No!
197,Phoebe,No!
198,Phoebe,Look at that!
199,Phoebe,It's a line of ants!
200,Phoebe,They're working as a team!
201,Rachel,Phoebe!
202,Phoebe,"Right, oh yeah."
203,Phoebe,"Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her."
204,Phoebe,"Uff, I hope he lets her down easy."
205,Phoebe,Let's go.
206,Rachel,"Come on Phoebe, look at that!"
207,Rachel,"They are not breaking up, look at them."
208,Rachel,"Okay that's, you know what that is?"
209,Rachel,"That is a, that is a second date, that's what that is!"
210,Rachel,"Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh..."
211,Phoebe,Oh no!
212,Phoebe,"That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive."
213,Rachel,Ohh!
214,Rachel,"Phoebe, this is all your fault!"
215,Rachel,"Now he loves her, he's gonna marry her, and this is all your fault."
216,Phoebe,You said it was okay!
217,Rachel,You said she was bald!
218,Phoebe,What?!
219,Phoebe,What-what-what-what-what?!
220,Rachel,"Phoebe, we can't, we just can't just let it happen!"
221,Rachel,"Okay, we have to do something!"
222,Rachel,We have to break them up!
223,Rachel,Okay?
224,Rachel,"Just go in there and like, shave her head!"
225,Rachel,You owe me one bald girl!
226,Phoebe,"Okay, first of all, breathe."
227,Phoebe,"Second of all, I don't get it."
228,Phoebe,Aren't you the one that decided that you didn't want to be with Ross?
229,Rachel,Yes.
230,Phoebe,Well isn't he your friend?
231,Phoebe,Don't you want him to be happy?
232,Rachel,Yes.
233,Phoebe,So?
234,Rachel,"I just y'know, I didn't expect him to be this happy so soon."
235,Rachel,Ufff.
236,Rachel,Ooo-ooh!
237,Phoebe,Oh no.
238,Rachel,What?
239,Phoebe,"Oh, we killed them all."
240,Rachel,Oh!
241,Monica,Please tell me you're stopping now.
242,Monica,You are insane!
243,Monica,You-you gotta give this up!
244,Monica,Sit down.
245,Monica,All right?
246,Monica,"Please, just listen to me."
247,Monica,You are terrible at this!
248,Monica,Okay?
249,Monica,You are the worst ultimate fighter ever!
250,Monica,Ever!
251,Monica,"Well then, y'know what?"
252,Monica,I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this.
253,Monica,"So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me."
254,Monica,Then I've gotta go.
255,Monica,Bye.
256,Monica,Yes?
257,Chandler,"Thank you, sir."
258,Chandler,No.
259,Chandler,"No, not at all, that's-that's ridiculous."
260,Chandler,"Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!"
261,Chandler,Run!
262,Chandler,"Run you crazy, rich freak!"
263,Rachel,"Oh, I can't watch this."
264,Joey,"Check it out, he's winning!"
265,Joey,Pete's winning!
266,Monica,Really?
267,Joey,No-o-o!!
268,Joey,TV
269,Phoebe,"Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?"
270,Ross,"Well, this is ironic."
271,Ross,"Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't."
0,Joey,"Okay, pick a card."
1,Chandler,Okay.
2,Joey,"All right now, memorize it."
3,Joey,You got it?
4,Chandler,Oh yes.
5,Joey,Is that your card?
6,Chandler,Yes.
7,Ross,Hi!
8,Chandler,Hi there!
9,Phoebe,What are you talking about?
10,Ross,"Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning."
11,Joey,Whoa!
12,Joey,This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town!
13,Joey,Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!!
14,Joey,"I mean, way to go Ben!"
15,Joey,Man!
16,Joey,I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.
17,Ross,"I know, it's crazy!"
18,Ross,We were just pushing Ben on the swings
19,Joey,I'm always on the swings!
20,Joey,What am I doing wrong?
21,Chandler,That.
22,Chandler,Opening Credits
23,Rachel,"Okay, gotta go!"
24,Rachel,Wish me luck!
25,Joey,Luck!
26,Chandler,"Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?"
27,Rachel,"Uh well, y'know what?"
28,Rachel,I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day
29,Chandler,"Unwilling to steal from work, interesting."
30,Monica,"Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me."
31,Rachel,"Okay guys, way to wish me luck!"
32,Phoebe,"Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday."
33,Phoebe,I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
34,Joey,"Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month."
35,Phoebe,"Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise."
36,Monica,I think it's a great idea.
37,Monica,"Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends."
38,Joey,Ross!!
39,Joey,We're having a surprise party for Rachel!
40,Ross,Okay!
41,Joey,Done.
42,Phoebe,"Okay, great so do you want to do it together?"
43,Monica,I would love to do it together!
44,Joey,They're gonna do it together.
45,Chandler,Dude!
46,Chandler,That's my girlfriend!
47,Joey,"What, so I gotta shut it down now?"
48,Ross,"All right, I gotta take off."
49,Ross,I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.
50,Monica,It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
51,Ross,Yeah.
52,Chandler,Weirder than watching his two moms make out?
53,Joey,Whoa-whoa dad?
54,Joey,There's a dad in the commercial?
55,Ross,Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
56,Joey,"Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad."
57,Joey,I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
58,Ross,You're not his godfather.
59,Joey,What?!
60,Joey,Are you kidding?
61,Ross,Of course I am!
62,Ross,"Okay, let's go godfather."
63,Joey,All right!
64,Joey,Hey!
65,Joey,"I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!"
66,Ross,Really?
67,Ross,That's great!
68,Joey,I know!
69,Joey,I know!
70,Joey,"It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her"
71,Joey,"Oh yeah, yeah!"
72,Joey,He's done tons of commercials.
73,Joey,"I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company."
74,Joey,"In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies."
75,Joey,Chandler was mad.
76,Ross,"Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one."
77,Ross,Ben is way cuter than that kid.
78,Ross,"I mean look at him, look at you,"
79,Joey,That's great.
80,Joey,"Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?"
81,Ross,"Joey, you look nothing like Ben."
82,Joey,I look more like him than you do!
83,Rachel,"Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric  Sorry."
84,Rachel,"Oh, what a fun office."
85,Rachel,"Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror storiesabout ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke."
86,Rachel,and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
87,Monica,That doesn't seem fair.
88,Rachel,I know!
89,Rachel,"It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!"
90,Chandler,"Yeah, it is the best."
91,Rachel,I mean what if this keeps happening?
92,Rachel,"Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know?"
93,Rachel,"And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick?"
94,Rachel,Me or Smokey Smokerson?
95,Monica,"Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke."
96,Monica,Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
97,Rachel,"Yeah, I can do that."
98,Chandler,"Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke."
99,Phoebe,Hey!
100,Monica,Hey!
101,Phoebe,"Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?"
102,Rachel,I would love to!
103,Phoebe,Oh good!
104,Chandler,"Yeah, I wanna go to babe."
105,Phoebe,Oh good.
106,Phoebe,"Oh wait, I change my mind!"
107,Phoebe,"Okay, let's talk about the party!"
108,Phoebe,I have so many ideas!
109,Monica,"Yeah, me too!"
110,Phoebe,"Oh, look at that."
111,Monica,"All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs!"
112,Monica,I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
113,Phoebe,What happened to the intimate dinner party?
114,Monica,"Oh, we're not doing that."
115,Monica,Okay
116,Phoebe,"So wow, it looks like you took care of everything."
117,Phoebe,"Thanks a lot, co-host."
118,Monica,What?!
119,Monica,"I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!"
120,Phoebe,Like what?
121,Monica,Cups.
122,Phoebe,Cups?
123,Phoebe,You're giving me cups?
124,Monica,And ice!
125,Phoebe,Cups and ice?
126,Phoebe,"Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice?"
127,Phoebe,All right.
128,Phoebe,"Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!"
129,Monica,"Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant"
130,Phoebe,I got it!
131,Phoebe,Mine!
132,Ross,Hi.
133,Monica,Hey!
134,Monica,How'd the audition go?
135,Ross,Not so good.
136,Monica,"Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's  ""Audition didn't go so well."
137,Monica,"Yeah it did?"""
138,Ross,Yeah I am!
139,Ross,"Yeah, Ben got a second audition!"
140,Joey,"Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback."
141,Monica,You got a callback too didn't you?
142,Joey,Yeah I did!
143,Rachel,"Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air."
144,Rachel,Oh great!
145,Rachel,Oh that's okay.
146,Rachel,"Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those?"
147,Rachel,"Y'know what, actually  Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?"
148,Rachel,"Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know?"
149,Rachel,"Y'know what I mean, like dubbies?"
150,Rachel,"And I actually, I thought to myself, ""Wow, those guys are crazy!"""
151,Rachel,"But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time."
152,Rachel,"Oh, me too."
153,Rachel,"Oh, me too."
154,Ross,"Oh God, this is so nerve wracking!"
155,Ross,How-how do you do this?
156,Joey,"Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so"
157,Joey,Who knows?
158,Joey,The Casting
159,Ross,Yes!!
160,Ross,I knew it!!
161,Ross,Bye-bye!
162,Ross,So long!
163,Ross,Later!
164,Joey,Oh this is great!
165,Joey,I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
166,Ross,Yeah!
167,Ross,The Casting
168,Joey,"Man, this is gonna be kinda weird."
169,Ross,"Yeah, it is."
170,Ross,"No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird."
171,Phoebe,Hey!
172,Phoebe,Ross and
173,Chandler,Hi!
174,Phoebe,Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
175,Chandler,Ah sure.
176,Chandler,What's in 'em?
177,Phoebe,"Umm, cups."
178,Chandler,"Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water."
179,Ross,Seriously that's a lot of cups.
180,Phoebe,"Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice."
181,Chandler,Y'know I rued the day oncedidn't get a whole lot else done.
182,Phoebe,"Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups."
183,Phoebe,"Oh, hi Joey!"
184,Joey,Hey Pheebs!
185,Joey,Hey!
186,Ross,Hey!
187,Joey,"Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here."
188,Joey,I wanna talk to you about something.
189,Ross,What's up?
190,Joey,"Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good."
191,Joey,"So, I think I'm just gonna step aside."
192,Joey,I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
193,Ross,"Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great."
194,Ross,Thanks man.
195,Joey,That's it?
196,Joey,You're-you're gonna let me do this?!
197,Joey,This-this is my career we're talking about here!
198,Ross,"Well, you just"
199,Joey,I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it!
200,Joey,"Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!"
201,Ross,What?
202,Joey,What?
203,Joey,Chandler!
204,Joey,Tell 'em!
205,Chandler,"Well I mean, let me get the door first."
206,Chandler,"Oh, hi!"
207,Chandler,No one.
208,Ross,Why should Ben step aside?
209,Ross,It was his audition in the first place!
210,Ross,You-you just tagged along!
211,Ross,"You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad."
212,Joey,At least I care about his feelings!
213,Ross,What?
214,Joey,Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn't get it?
215,Ross,And why wouldn't he get it?
216,Joey,"Oh, come on!"
217,Joey,Have you seen what my kid can do?!
218,Joey,Huh?!
219,Joey,I mean he dials phones!
220,Joey,He-he-he eats tortilla chips!
221,Joey,He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
222,Ross,Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
223,Joey,You just give him a spoon baby!
224,Ross,Oh yeah?
225,Ross,I guess we'll just see!
226,Joey,Yeah!
227,Joey,Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
228,Ross,You're kid's name is Raymond!
229,Joey,Yeah?!
230,Joey,So's yours!
231,Monica,How did work go?
232,Rachel,Oh it was great!
233,Rachel,It was great!
234,Rachel,"I went down there just like you said, y'know?"
235,Rachel,And we talked business.
236,Rachel,Kim totally took my opinions.
237,Monica,You stink!
238,Rachel,Thanks!
239,Monica,"No, I'm-I'm serious!"
240,Rachel,Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking.
241,Rachel,This is actually the smell of success.
242,Chandler,"Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God!"
243,Chandler,You smoked!
244,Rachel,I did not!
245,Chandler,Yes you did!
246,Chandler,You look happy and sick; you smoked!
247,Rachel,"All right, fine!"
248,Rachel,But I had too!
249,Rachel,I had to do it for my career!
250,Chandler,I wish I had smoked for my career
251,Monica,That's so gross!
252,Rachel,"No well, no it's not that bad, y'know?"
253,Rachel,"I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up."
254,Chandler,"Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!"

365,Phoebe,"Yeah, but you've got to pull yourself together!"
366,Phoebe,Monica can't see you like this!
367,Phoebe,Then she'll know something's wrong!
368,Rachel,I know.
369,Rachel,I know.
370,Rachel,Oh God.
371,Rachel,There's no tissue!
372,Rachel,Can you grab me some toilet paper?
373,Phoebe,Yeah.
374,Phoebe,"Oh, that's gone too."
375,Phoebe,This is Monica's bathroom right?
376,Rachel,Oh!
377,Phoebe,No-no!
378,Phoebe,I-II found one.
379,Rachel,Okay.
380,Rachel,Oh thank you!
381,Rachel,Oh God!
382,Rachel,Can I have another one?
383,Phoebe,Sure.
384,Phoebe,Do you need some floss?
385,Rachel,Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn't show up!
386,Phoebe,Oh here's a whole bunch.
387,Rachel,"Oh, I mean she's gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, ""Oh that poor girl."""
388,Rachel,Y'know?
389,Rachel,Then she'll have to come back here and live all alone.
390,Phoebe,Oh my God!
391,Rachel,What?
392,Phoebe,"There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it's positive."
393,Phoebe,Monica's pregnant.
394,Phoebe,So I guess she won't be totally alone.
395,Phoebe,Commercial Break
396,Rachel,Oh my God!
397,Phoebe,I know!
398,Phoebe,Monica's gonna have a baby!
399,Phoebe,"Hey, can this count as her something new?"
400,Rachel,Oh my God!
401,Phoebe,"Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?"
402,Rachel,"No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night."
403,Phoebe,"Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever!"
404,Phoebe,The bride is pregnant.
405,Phoebe,The groom is missing.
406,Phoebe,And I'm still holding this.
407,Rachel,"Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this."
408,Phoebe,Right.
409,Rachel,Okay?
410,Phoebe,"Yeah, okay."
411,Phoebe,"Hey, wait."
412,Phoebe,Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?
413,Rachel,No.
414,Rachel,Why?
415,Phoebe,"Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it."
416,Rachel,Anything?
417,Ross,No!
418,Ross,"I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn't heard from him."
419,Ross,I-I-I talked to Chandler's parents again!
420,Phoebe,You told them he was missing?
421,Ross,No!
422,Ross,I made it seem like I was just calling to chat.
423,Ross,"Pretty sure, they both think I'm interested in them."
424,Rachel,"All right, we've got to tell her he's gone."
425,Ross,No!
426,Ross,Hey!
427,Ross,Hey!
428,Ross,We can't!
429,Rachel,"Ross, she's gonna start getting ready soon!"
430,Ross,"Well, can't you at least stall her a little?"
431,Ross,I'll-I'll go back to some of the places I went last night.
432,Rachel,"All right, well how much time do you need?"
433,Ross,Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
434,Rachel,One hour.
435,Ross,Give me two.
436,Rachel,Then why do you ask?
437,Ross,"Okay, wish me luck."
438,Phoebe,Okay.
439,Phoebe,I'm going with you.
440,Ross,Why?
441,Phoebe,"Ross, you're tired."
442,Phoebe,You've been looking all night.
443,Phoebe,And clearly you suck at this.
444,Rachel,"All right, I'll see you guys later."
445,Phoebe,Okay.
446,Phoebe,"Wait, do you know how you're going to stall her?"
447,Rachel,I'll figure something out.
448,Phoebe,All right.
449,Phoebe,Good luck.
450,Rachel,Thanks.
451,Monica,Hey!
452,Monica,"Okay, so I thought we'd start with my make up and then do my hair."

454,Rachel,"I-I, I need you to talk to me."
455,Monica,About what?
456,Rachel,Umm I'm never gonna getting married!

459,Monica,"Okay, are we done with that?"
460,Rachel,No Monica!
461,Rachel,I'm serious!
462,Rachel,"Oh, maybe I should just forget about it."
463,Rachel,Become a lesbian or something.
464,Monica,Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
465,Rachel,Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
466,Monica,Rachel!
467,Monica,You okay?
468,Joey,"Excuse me, Aaron?"
469,Joey,Hi!
470,Joey,"Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules."
471,Joey,"Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at."
472,Joey,"It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four."

493,Ross,We are never gonna find him!
494,Ross,He's one guy in a huge city!
495,Phoebe,Oh my God!
496,Phoebe,Is that him?
497,Ross,"That is an old, Chinese woman!"
498,Phoebe,"He could be in disguise, y'know."
499,Ross,"Aw, y'knowY'know, maybe we're-we're just approaching this all wrong."
500,Ross,"If you're Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you'd go?"
501,Ross,So this is your office?
502,Chandler,How did you guys find me?
503,Chandler,I knew I should've hid at the gym!
504,Phoebe,What the hell are you doing?
505,Chandler,Panicking!
506,Chandler,And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica.
507,Chandler,How is she?
508,Ross,She's fine.
509,Ross,She doesn't know you're gone.
510,Ross,"And she doesn't have to know, okay?"

517,Chandler,"Because if I go home, we're gonna become the Bings!"
518,Chandler,I can't be the Bings!
519,Ross,What's wrong with being the Bings?
520,Chandler,The Bings have horrible marriages!
521,Chandler,They yell.
522,Chandler,They fight.
523,Chandler,And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
524,Ross,"Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?"
525,Chandler,No.
526,Ross,Then you are neither of your parents!
527,Chandler,It's not just their marriage!
528,Chandler,"I mean, look at yours."
529,Chandler,Look at everybody's!
530,Chandler,The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman!
531,Chandler,And I've met me; I am not Paul Newman.
532,Chandler,I don't race cars!
533,Chandler,I don't make popcorn!
534,Chandler,None of my proceeds go to charity.
535,Phoebe,"But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do."
536,Phoebe,But I totally believe you can do this.
537,Chandler,I want to.
538,Chandler,"I love her so much, but I'm afrIt's too huge."
539,Ross,"Y'know, okay."
540,Ross,You're right.
541,Ross,It is huge.
542,Ross,So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time?
543,Ross,Okay?
544,Ross,"Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it."

18,Phoebe,"Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun."
19,Phoebe,"No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END."
20,Monica,"Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves."
21,Joey,"Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over."
22,Monica,"Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing."
23,Chandler,"Well, how do you find clothes that fit?"
24,Joey,"Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question."
25,Monica,"Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look."
26,Joey,"No, not that one."
27,Joey,"We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket."
28,Chandler,"Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking."
29,Chandler,'Did you see that play?
30,Chandler,Do you want some more beer?
31,Chandler,Is that Spike Lee?'
32,Monica,"Ok.  Hey, why don't you ask Richard?"
33,Joey,"Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?"
34,Chandler,"Ok, that's Eric."
35,Monica,"I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game?"
36,Monica,What?
37,Joey,I don't know.
38,Monica,C'mon.
39,Monica,Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.
40,Chandler,"I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old  -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings."
41,Monica,"So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me."
42,Monica,"Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag."
43,Joey,How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?
44,Chandler,"Ok, this could be tough."
45,Joey,"Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar."
46,Chandler,"Ooh, you almost had it."
47,Ross,"No no, you're fine, you're fine."
48,Ross,Hi.
49,Ross,Oh you guys are not gonna believe what happened.
50,Ross,"Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up."
51,Ross,He pulled himself up.
52,Ross,Standing man.
53,Ross,I'm sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it.
54,Ross,I don't believe this.
55,Ross,"I miss, I miss the first time of everything."
56,Ross,"I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled."
57,Ross,What else did I miss?
58,Ross,"Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?"
59,Ross,"Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff."
60,Ross,"Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend."
61,Ross,"No listen , I mean, I feel like-  CAROL and"
62,Ross,Really?
63,Ross,"I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared."
64,Ross,"Oh look, did, did you just see that?"
65,Ross,Did you see?
66,Ross,"He just waved, he just waved, he's never waved before, you've never waved before."
67,Ross,Yes he has.
68,Ross,Very good.
69,Phoebe,Hey.
70,Rachel,"Hey Phoebs, whatcha got there?"
71,Phoebe,"Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment."
72,Monica,"Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay."
73,Phoebe,"Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness."
74,Phoebe,"You know, before she killed herself."
75,Chandler,Hey.
76,Joey,Hey.
77,Rachel,Hey.
78,Monica,Hey.
79,Monica,"Where is he, where's Richard?"
80,Monica,Did you ditch him?
81,Joey,Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie.
82,Joey,"What's the matter with you, he's parking the car."
83,Monica,So'd you guys have fun?
84,Chandler,Your boyfriend is so cool.
85,Monica,Really?
86,Chandler,"Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar."
87,Chandler,"Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15."
88,Rachel,"Wow, he must like you the best."
89,Joey,"Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats."
90,Joey,"You never even saw the money, it was like this."
91,Joey,"Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats ."
92,Chandler,You're welcome.
93,Chandler,"Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car ."
94,Joey,No problem.
95,Joey,Hey Chandler
96,Chandler,I think they get it.
97,Joey,Ok.
98,Chandler,There's the man.
99,Joey,He-he-eyy.
100,Joey,Ok.
101,Joey,He kept my dollar.
102,Monica,"So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?"
103,Ross,"Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg."
104,Ross,Buy mommy.
105,Ross,CAROL and
106,Ross,Have a good time.
107,Ross,"Ok, Ben."
108,Monica,Ross.
109,Ross,Yeah.
110,Monica,Look.
111,Monica,"Joey, do you know we can see you from here?"
112,Joey,How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
113,Ross,"Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula."
114,Monica,"You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard."
115,Joey,"Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him."
116,Ross,Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
117,Chandler,"Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know."
118,Monica,"So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?"
119,Joey,Oh we flipped for it.
120,Joey,"I got the cigar, he got the moustache."
121,Joey,"Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks."
122,Ross,"Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine."
123,Chandler,"Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs."
124,Monica,You're meeting Richard?
125,Joey,"Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game."
126,Chandler,"Yeah, didn't he tell ya?"
127,Monica,"Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys."
128,Chandler,You hear that?
129,Chandler,We're the guys.
130,Joey,We're the guys.
131,Monica,With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?
132,Ross,Thank you.
133,Ross,"Hi, we're visitiing."
134,Ross,It's Ben and his da-da.
135,Ross,Da-da.
136,Ross,Can you say da-da?
137,Ross,"Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try."
138,Rachel,No luck huh?
139,Ross,Naa.
140,Ross,"A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off."
141,Rachel,"Oh, yeah sure, Ok."
142,Ross,What're you doing?
143,Rachel,"Uh, I'm holding Ben."
144,Ross,"Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb."
145,Rachel,Ok.
146,Ross,Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.
147,Rachel,This is how I would hold a football.
148,Ross,"Ok, here, here."
149,Ross,There we go.
150,Rachel,"Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies."
151,Rachel,"I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one."
152,Ross,"It's alright, it's no big deal."
153,Rachel,Really?
154,Ross,"Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby."
155,Rachel,What?
156,Ross,What?
157,Rachel,You think about stuff like that?
158,Ross,"Uhh, yeah."
159,Ross,"I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies."
160,Rachel,"Two, two babies?"
161,Ross,Yeah.
162,Ross,"Ya know, a boy and a girl."
163,Ross,Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.
164,Rachel,Then what's gonna happen?
165,Ross,"Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale."
166,Rachel,Uh-huh.
167,Ross,"Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want."
168,Ross,"And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great."
169,Rachel,Wow.
170,Rachel,"Wow, that's great."
171,Rachel,Great.
172,Rachel,"Ok, wow, you know what."
173,Ross,Huh?
174,Rachel,"I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this  and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee."
175,Rachel,"Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot."
176,Rachel,I don't have a pot.
177,Rachel,"Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale."
178,Rachel,Hey is that a door?
179,Phoebe,Hey.
180,Phoebe,"Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes."
181,Monica,So you watched the movies huh?
182,Phoebe,"Uh huh, what is happening to the world?"
183,Phoebe,"I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies."
184,Phoebe,"With the web, the spider she dies, she does."
185,Phoebe,She has babies and dies.
186,Phoebe,"It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud."
187,Monica,"Alright, you wanna feel better?"
188,Phoebe,Yeah.
189,Monica,"Ok, here, watch this."
190,Phoebe,It's a Wonderful Life.
191,Phoebe,Yes I've heard of this.
192,Monica,"So you can't lose, it's there in the title."
193,Monica,Wonderfullness is baked right in.
194,Phoebe,"Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease."
195,Phoebe,"Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity."
196,Chandler,"Hey, big guy, game time."
197,Monica,There's a game?
198,Chandler,"Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop."
199,Chandler,Bring your nerves of steel.
200,Monica,"Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other."
201,Monica,"Alright that's great, then just go."
202,Monica,Go Knicks.
203,Monica,"Oh, then go Vassar."
204,Monica,"Ok, then just go."
205,Monica,"Oh, why does this bother me so much?"
206,Monica,I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.
207,Phoebe,Sure.
208,Monica,"It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?"
209,Phoebe,Does it matter?
210,Phoebe,You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.
211,Rachel,Aghh.
212,Phoebe,Me too.
213,Monica,I've got a question.
214,Monica,Richard made plans again with the guys.
215,Rachel,"Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century."
216,Monica,"Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there."
217,Monica,"Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles."
218,Ross,"Ok, what the hell happened back there?"
219,Rachel,"I don't know, you tell me."
220,Rachel,"One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes."
221,Ross,"Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff."
222,Ross,"Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders."
223,Rachel,"Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks."
224,Ross,"C'mon, what, you never think about our future?"
225,Rachel,"Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night."
226,Rachel,I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be.
227,Rachel,You know what our childrens names are gonna be.
228,Ross,"No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good."
229,Rachel,What was the book?
230,Ross,The big book of childrens' names.
231,Rachel,"Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing."
232,Ross,Yeah.
233,Rachel,But I do not want to have everything decided for me.
234,Rachel,I spent my whole life like that.
235,Rachel,"It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left."
236,Rachel,"I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that."
237,Ross,Ok fine.
238,Rachel,Thank you.
239,Ross,We're not done.
240,Rachel,I didn't know that.
241,Ross,"Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that."
242,Rachel,"Fine, I will."
243,Ross,"Good, 'cause I love you."
244,Rachel,Oh yeah.
245,Ross,Yeah.
246,Rachel,Well I love you too.
247,Ross,Well that's the first time we've said that.
248,Rachel,Yes it is.
249,Ross,"Well, I'm gonna kiss you."
250,Rachel,Well you better.
251,Phoebe,Hey.
252,Phoebe,Oh thanks for the great movie tip.
253,Monica,Did you like it?
254,Phoebe,Oh yeah.
255,Phoebe,"You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed."
256,Monica,"Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?"
257,Phoebe,"I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed."
258,Phoebe,"It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, ""It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."""
259,Chandler,Kick save and... denied.
260,Joey,Man you are incredible.
261,Chandler,"Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's."
262,Monica,Honey.
263,Monica,"Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table."
264,Monica,Score!
265,Monica,Now can we go?
266,Chandler,"See, that's why we don't let her play."
267,Monica,Um-hmm.
268,Chandler,"Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault."
269,Chandler,I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.
270,Joey,"Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with."
271,Joey,"No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this."
272,Joey,He is so much cooler than our dads.
273,Joey,"I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow."
274,Joey,What are you kickin me for?
275,Joey,Huh?
276,Joey,I'm tryin to talk here.
277,Joey,Oh yeah.
278,Chandler,No.
279,Joey,Nooooo.
280,Chandler,"Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular."
281,Chandler,"See, when we say dad, we mean buddy."
282,Chandler,We mean pal.
283,Chandler,"No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad."
284,Chandler,I've even got some dads down at work.
285,Monica,Nighty-nite.
286,Chandler,You're not a dad.
287,Chandler,You're not a dad.
288,Joey,Not a dad.
289,Chandler,I can't believe you got us into trouble.
290,Monica,So are you ok?
291,Monica,Come here.
292,Monica,I'll make you feel like one of the guys.
293,Monica,"You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball."
294,Monica,"Yeah, well they suck too."
295,Ross,"Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail."
296,Rachel,"Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter."
297,Ross,Hello.
298,Ross,Come on up.
299,Ross,I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together.
300,Rachel,"Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben?"
301,Rachel,"Yes we can, yes we can."
302,Rachel,There.
303,Rachel,I did it.
304,Rachel,I did it.
305,Rachel,"Look at that, oh, stays on and everything."
306,Rachel,Hi.
307,Rachel,"I'm sorry, what did you just say?"
308,Rachel,Did you just say hi?
309,Rachel,"Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said 'Hi'."
310,Ross,"Wha, what?"
311,Rachel,Ben just said hi.
312,Ross,"What, the word hi?"
313,Rachel,"Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi."
314,Ross,"Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything."
315,Rachel,"Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him."
316,Rachel,CAROL and
317,Rachel,Guess what.
318,Rachel,Ben just said his first word.
319,Ross,Something about hi.
320,Rachel,"You know, actually it's more like, hi."
321,Rachel,Hi.
322,Rachel,Hi.
323,Rachel,Hi.
324,Ross,"Well, this was fun."
325,Ross,"Uh, we should really do it again sometime, wha'dya say?"
326,Ross,Ok. Alright so I've got him.

328,Ross,"Ok, bye you guys."
329,Rachel,Take care.
330,Ross,Bye Ben.
331,Rachel,"Did, did he just, did he, did he just say, he said bye."
332,Rachel,He said bye.
333,Rachel,"You said, you said bye to me."
334,Rachel,You said bye to me.
335,Ross,"Alright, alright, ok. Bye."
336,Ross,Bye.
337,Ross,Bye.
338,Ross,Bye.
339,Ross,CLOSING CREDITS
340,Phoebe,"Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him."
341,Phoebe,"Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again."
342,Phoebe,"But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it."
343,Phoebe,"And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so."
344,Phoebe,"Ok, here we go."
345,Phoebe,"Oh, I'm so glad you're here."
346,Phoebe,END
0,Rachel,"Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?"
1,Rachel,It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family.
2,Rachel,"See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job."
3,Rachel,"Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'."
4,Rachel,I'm with you.
5,Rachel,"Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard."
6,Rachel,And I think I'm doing better.
7,Rachel,I really do.
8,Rachel,Does anybody need coffee?
9,Rachel,"Oh, look at that."
10,Rachel,Opening Credits
11,Rachel,"Excuse me, sir."
12,Rachel,"Hi, you come in here all time."
13,Rachel,"I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?"
14,Rachel,"Ok, ok, that's fine."
15,Rachel,Fine.
16,Rachel,"Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before."
17,Rachel,Only $98.50 to go.
18,Monica,Hey.
19,Monica,"Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?"
20,Ross,"No, they're not."
21,Monica,"Yes, they are."
22,Monica,The Blymens invited them.
23,Ross,You're wrong.
24,Monica,I am not wrong.
25,Ross,You're wrong.
26,Monica,"No, I just talked to them."
27,Ross,I'm calling Mom.
28,Joey,"Hey, hey."
29,Chandler,Hey.
30,Phoebe,Hey.
31,Chandler,And this from the cry-for-help department.
32,Chandler,Are you wearing makeup?
33,Joey,"Yes, I am."
34,Joey,"As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model."
35,Chandler,"That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman."
36,Phoebe,What were you modeling for?
37,Joey,You know those posters for the city free clinic?
38,Monica,"Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those ""healthy, healthy, healthy guys""?"
39,Phoebe,"You know, the asthma guy was really cute."
40,Chandler,Do you know which one you're gonna be?
41,Joey,"No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so..."
42,Chandler,"Good luck, man."
43,Chandler,I hope you get it.
44,Joey,Thanks.
45,Ross,"Well, you were right."
46,Ross,"How can they do this to us, huh?"
47,Ross,It's Thanksgiving.
48,Monica,"Ok, I'll tell you what."
49,Monica,How about I cook dinner at my place?
50,Monica,I'll make it just like Mom's.
51,Ross,Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
52,Monica,"You know, they're not actually supposed to have..."
53,Monica,I'll work on the lumps.
54,Monica,"Joey, you're going home, right?"
55,Joey,Yeah.
56,Monica,"And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays."
57,Chandler,"Yes, every single one of them."
58,Monica,"Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?"
59,Phoebe,"Yes, and her boyfriend."
60,Phoebe,But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.
61,Monica,"So you're free Thursday, then."
62,Phoebe,Yeah.
63,Phoebe,"Oh, can I come?"
64,Monica,Yeah.
65,Monica,"Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?"
66,Rachel,Absolutely.
67,Rachel,"Shoop, shoop, shoop."
68,Rachel,Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
69,Chandler,I thought it was $98.50.
70,Rachel,"Yeah, well it was."
71,Rachel,"I, I broke a cup."
72,Ross,"Well, I'm off to Carol's."
73,Phoebe,"Ooh, ooh!"
74,Phoebe,Why don't we invite her?
75,Ross,"Ooh, ooh."
76,Ross,"Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner."
77,Ross,"Hi, is uh, is Carol here?"
78,Ross,"Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull."
79,Ross,"Well, not mine, but...Susan"
80,Ross,Thanks.
81,Ross,"Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum."
82,Ross,Kinda like a big face without skin.
83,Ross,"Ok.  Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian."
84,Ross,"Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle."
85,Ross,A classic.
86,Ross,"The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet?"
87,Ross,Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
88,Ross,"You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?"
89,Ross,"Do you uh, do you talk about me?"
90,Ross,Really?
91,Ross,"Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too."
92,Ross,Not that I believe any of this.
93,Phoebe,"Oh, I believe it."
94,Phoebe,I think the baby can totally hear everything.
95,Phoebe,I can show you.
96,Phoebe,"Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say."
97,Chandler,I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment.
98,Chandler,"In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head."
99,Monica,"Hey, Rach, did you make your money?"
100,Rachel,"No, not even close."
101,Rachel,"Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop."
102,Monica,"Rach, here's your mail."
103,Rachel,"Thanks, you can just put it on the table."
104,Monica,"No, here's your mail."
105,Rachel,"Thanks, you can just put it on the table."
106,Monica,Would you just open it?
107,Rachel,"Oh my god, oh, you guys are great."
108,Monica,We all chipped in.
109,Joey,We did?
110,Monica,You owe me 20 bucks.
111,Rachel,Thank you.
112,Rachel,Thank you so much!
113,Monica,"Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns."
114,Rachel,"Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner?"
115,Rachel,"What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?"
116,Chandler,"All right, I'm nine years old."
117,Ross,"Oh, I hate this story."
118,Chandler,We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner.
119,Chandler,"I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced."
120,Rachel,Oh my god.
121,Chandler,Yes.
122,Chandler,It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
123,Joey,"Uh, hi."
124,Joey,"We uh, we used to work together."
125,Joey,"Yeah, at Macy's."
126,Joey,"You were the Obsession girl, right?"
127,Joey,I was the Aramis guy.
128,Joey,Aramis?
129,Joey,Aramis?
130,Joey,I gotta tell you.
131,Joey,You're the best in the business.
132,Joey,I'm serious.
133,Joey,You're amazing.
134,Joey,"You know when to spritz, when to lay back."
135,Joey,"Ooh, you smell great tonight."
136,Joey,What're you wearing?
137,Joey,"Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?"
138,Joey,What's wrong?
139,Joey,Oh.
140,Joey,What?
141,Joey,"Wait, wait, wait!"
142,Joey,(Joey turns around and sees his face on a poster in the subway.
143,Joey,The poster
144,Joey,So I guess you all saw it.
145,Rachel,Saw what?
146,Phoebe,"No, we were just laughing."
147,Phoebe,"You know, how laughter can be infectious."
148,Joey,Set another place for Thanksgiving.
149,Joey,My entire family thinks I have VD.
150,Chandler,"Tonight, on a very special Blossom."
151,Chandler,Commercial Break
152,Monica,"Mmm, looking good."
153,Monica,"Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming."
154,Monica,What?
155,Ross,I don't know.
156,Ross,It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
157,Monica,"All right, that's it."
158,Monica,You know what?
159,Monica,Just get out of my way and stop moping.
160,Ross,That's closer.
161,Rachel,I got the tickets!
162,Rachel,I got the tickets!
163,Rachel,"Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop."
164,Chandler,"Oh, you must stop shooping."
165,Rachel,"Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff."
166,Joey,"Chandler, will you just come in already?"
167,Chandler,"No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment."
168,Phoebe,"Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!"
169,Chandler,"Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore."
170,Joey,"Hey, Monica, I got a question."
171,Joey,I don't see any tater tots.
172,Monica,That's not a question.
173,Joey,But my mom always makes them.
174,Joey,It's like a tradition.
175,Joey,"You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot!"
176,Joey,It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
177,Monica,"All right, fine."
178,Monica,"Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots."
179,Ross,"Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child."
180,Monica,Ah!
181,Ross,"Ok, Mom never hit."
182,Phoebe,"Ok, all done."
183,Monica,"What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes?"
184,Monica,Ross needs lumps!
185,Phoebe,"Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions."
186,Monica,Why would we do that?
187,Phoebe,"Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died."
188,Monica,"Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up."
189,Rachel,"Ok, good-bye you guys."
190,Rachel,Thanks for everything.
191,Rachel,"Oh, sorry!"
192,Rachel,"Oh, sorry!"
193,Chandler,The most unbelievable thing has happened.
194,Chandler,Underdog has just gotten away.
195,Joey,The balloon?
196,Chandler,"No, no, the actual cartoon character."
197,Chandler,Of course the balloon.
198,Chandler,It's all over the news.
199,Chandler,"Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park."
200,Chandler,"I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?"
201,Rachel,"I can't, I gotta go."
202,Chandler,Come on.
203,Chandler,An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city.
204,Chandler,How often does that happen?
205,Phoebe,Almost never.
206,Monica,Got the keys?
207,Monica,or Got the keys!
208,Rachel,Ok.
209,Ross,"Ok, ok, here we go."
210,Ross,"Ok, where am I talking to, here?"
211,Ross,"I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but..."
212,Ross,"Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes."
213,Ross,"You know, I, you know, can't do this."
214,Ross,"Uh, this is too weird."
215,Ross,I feel stupid.
216,Ross,"Hello, baby."
217,Ross,"Hello, hello."
218,Rachel,I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
219,Phoebe,"Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down?"
220,Phoebe,"I mean, that was just mean."
221,Monica,"Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside."
222,Monica,Why are we standing here?
223,Rachel,We're waiting for you to open the door.
224,Rachel,You got the keys.
225,Monica,No I don't.
226,Rachel,"Yes, you do."
227,Rachel,"When we left, you said, ""got the keys."""
228,Monica,No I didn't.
229,Monica,"I asked, ""got the ke-eys?"""
230,Rachel,"No, no, no, you said, ""got the keys""."
231,Chandler,Do either of you have the keys?
232,Monica,The oven is on.
233,Rachel,"Oh, I gotta get my ticket!"
234,Joey,"Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key."
235,Monica,"Well then get it, get it!"
236,Joey,That tone will not make me go any faster.
237,Monica,Joey!
238,Joey,That one will.
239,Ross,"And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major."
240,Ross,"So, on a dare, I picked paleontology."
241,Ross,"And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus."
242,Ross,You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
243,Ross,"Oh, please."
244,Ross,"I am not singing to your stomach, ok?"
245,Ross,Shh!
246,Ross,"Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet."
247,Ross,"Hey, hey!"
248,Ross,"Hey, uh, did you just feel that?"
249,Ross,"Does it always, uh--?"
250,Ross,"Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you."
251,Ross,"When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo."
252,Ross,"Hey, hey, I'm your daddy."
253,Ross,I'm the one without any breasts.
254,Joey,"Nope, not that one."
255,Monica,Can you go any faster with that?
256,Joey,"Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys."
257,Joey,You do the math.
258,Monica,Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
259,Chandler,For an emergency just like this.
260,Rachel,"All right, listen, smirky."
261,Rachel,"If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this  right now."
262,Rachel,But I'm not.
263,Monica,I swear you said you had the keys.
264,Rachel,"No, I didn't."
265,Rachel,"I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys."
266,Phoebe,"Ooh, ok, that's it."
267,Phoebe,Enough with the keys.
268,Phoebe,No one say keys.
269,Monica,Why would I have the keys?
270,Rachel,Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
271,Monica,But I didn't.
272,Rachel,"Well, you should have."
273,Monica,Why?
274,Rachel,Because!
275,Monica,Why?
276,Rachel,Because!
277,Monica,Why?
278,Monica,Because everything is my responsibility?
279,Monica,Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone?
280,Monica,"You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes."
281,Monica,Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want?
282,Monica,"Nooooo, no, no!"
283,Monica,"Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I..."
284,Monica,I...
285,Chandler,"Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open."
286,Chandler,Here we go.
287,Monica,"Well, the turkey's burnt."
288,Monica,"Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined."
289,Ross,"Here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like Mom's."
290,Monica,"No, it doesn't, does it?"
291,Monica,"But you wanted lumps, Ross?"
292,Monica,"Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one."
293,Rachel,"Oh, god, this is great!"
294,Rachel,"The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys."
295,Joey,"Hey, we all had better plans."
296,Joey,This was nobody's first choice.
297,Monica,"Oh, really?"
298,Monica,So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
299,Joey,You call that delicious?
300,Monica,"Stop it, stop it, stop it!"
301,Chandler,Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
302,Phoebe,Ooh.
303,Rachel,What?
304,Phoebe,Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven.
305,Phoebe,Oh my god.
306,Phoebe,He's not alone.
307,Phoebe,Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
308,Joey,I've gotta see this.
309,Joey,All right Ugly Naked Guy!
310,Monica,"Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!"
311,Phoebe,It's nice that he has someone.
312,Chandler,Shall I carve?
313,Rachel,By all means.
314,Chandler,"Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?"
315,Ross,I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
316,Monica,Does anybody wanna split this with me?
317,Joey,"Oh, I will."
318,Phoebe,"Ooh, you guys have to make a wish."
319,Monica,Make a wish?
320,Phoebe,"Come on, you know, Thanksgiving."
321,Phoebe,"Ooh, you got the bigger half."
322,Phoebe,What'd you wish for?
323,Joey,The bigger half.
324,Chandler,I'd like to propose a toast.
325,Chandler,"Little toast here, ding ding."
326,Chandler,"I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting."
327,Chandler,"Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?"
328,Chandler,So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
329,Ross,"And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas."
330,Rachel,And a crappy New Year.
331,Chandler,"Here, here!"
332,Chandler,Closing Credits
0,Joey,"Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?"
1,Monica,Ok.
2,Joey,Alright!
3,Monica,But ehm...what is it not?
4,Joey,A place to entertain my lady friends.
5,Monica,And what else is it not?
6,Joey,A place to eat spaghetti.
7,Monica,Very good!
8,Monica,What do you need it for anyway?
9,Joey,"Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don't sell tickets here in New York, so..."
10,Rachel,Oh!
11,Rachel,So you're driving up to Connecticut?
12,Joey,Yeah Connecticut...Not West Virginia.
13,Monica,"Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there!"
14,Monica,I'd like to buy some tickets myself!
15,Joey,Uh!
16,Monica,"Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars."
17,Chandler,"Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million?"
18,Chandler,No thank you!
19,Phoebe,Hey will you get me tickets too?
20,Rachel,Yeah me too.
21,Rachel,oh!
22,Rachel,I have an idea.
23,Rachel,"Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it!"
24,Rachel,Everyone almost simultaneously except
25,Ross,yeah thats a great idea!
26,Ross,No thanks!
27,Phoebe,You don't wanna win the lottery?
28,Ross,"Uh...sure I do, and I also wanna be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart."
29,Chandler,Still on Amelia Earhart?
30,Ross,The woman just vanished!
31,Joey,"Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?"
32,Ross,No!
33,Ross,Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery?
34,Ross,I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
35,Chandler,Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.
36,Joey,I like those odds!
37,Ross,"Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki."
38,Chandler,I'll ask.
39,Chandler,Boohaki?
40,Ross,"Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her."
41,Rachel,"Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker."
42,Monica,How do you know she's gonna start talking?
43,Rachel,Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she understands what I'm saying.
44,Chandler,Kinda like Joey.
45,Joey,What's that now?
46,Joey,Opening credits
47,Monica,God!
48,Monica,Look at all these tickets!
49,Monica,It's so exciting!
50,Monica,You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.
51,Chandler,Pie eating contest?
52,Monica,Oh!
53,Monica,You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something?
54,Chandler,"No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries."
55,Monica,That was a good day!
56,Ross,"They're towing your car, they're towing your car!"
57,Monica,I'm parked in a garage on Morton!
58,Ross,They're towing a car.
59,Ross,And I am seeing...spots.
60,Joey,Oh my god Ross!
61,Joey,You don't have Emma!
62,Joey,And Rachel you don't have Emma!
63,Joey,Where's Emma?
64,Joey,Who has Emma!
65,Rachel,Joey relax!
66,Rachel,My mother picked her up two hours ago.
67,Rachel,You were there!
68,Joey,I was?
69,Joey,I did?
70,Rachel,She dropped off a casserole?
71,Joey,Oh yeah!
72,Joey,The casserole lady.
73,Monica,"So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?"
74,Ross,"Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!"
75,Chandler,Don't touch the phone!
76,Chandler,"I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it!"
77,Ross,Think he washed his hands?
78,Chandler,Hello?
79,Chandler,"Hey Charlie, what do you know?"
80,Rachel,What's going on?
81,Monica,Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency.
82,Monica,"But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three."
83,Joey,Ooh!
84,Joey,Tough odds!
85,Ross,Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!
86,Joey,Look who's coming around!
87,Chandler,Damnit.
88,Chandler,Alright call me when you know more.
89,Joey,Did you get it?
90,Chandler,One of the slots got filled.
91,Joey,By you!
92,Chandler,Sense the tone!
93,Chandler,No that kid Nate got it.
94,Monica,Oh!
95,Monica,I hate that guy!
96,Monica,I mean come on kid!
97,Monica,Pull up your pants!
98,Chandler,Yeah I know.
99,Rachel,"Well, there's two spots left right?"
100,Chandler,Yeah...I mean I want this so much!
101,Chandler,"I mean, I wanna get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care about Charlie."
102,Phoebe,Hey you guys!
103,Phoebe,"Ok, you're not going to believe this!"
104,Phoebe,I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!
105,Monica,"Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work."
106,Ross,A psychic AND a wishbone?
107,Ross,Guys!
108,Ross,Give someone else a chance!
109,Monica,"Alright, who wants to do it?"
110,Phoebe,Oh can I?
111,Phoebe,Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone.
112,Phoebe,It's really not fair either!
113,Phoebe,"You know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!"
114,Monica,"Ok, hey Rach?"
115,Rachel,"Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands."
116,Joey,I'll do it!!
117,Joey,It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.
118,Phoebe,I hope I win!
119,Monica,"Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right?"
120,Joey,I can't tell you what I'm wishing for!
121,Joey,Else...you know...won't come true!
122,Monica,Right!
123,Monica,".. but we ""know"" what you're wishing for!"
124,Joey,Can't really say!
125,Monica,"I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?"
126,Joey,I'm not really comfortable with these questions!
127,Joey,"Rachel, Chandler and"
128,Monica,"Please, just do it!"
129,Phoebe,"One, two, three!"
130,Joey,"I won, hey!"
131,Ross,"You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp!"
132,Ross,Ah!!
133,Ross,That thing gets hot!
134,Rachel,"You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes."
135,Rachel,How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?
136,Ross,"Uh, you're not gonna win."
137,Rachel,"Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us!"
138,Rachel,And then how you gonna feel?
139,Rachel,"You know, we're gonna be all like ""oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape"" and you're gonna be all like ""oh, I can't guys, I'll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai"""
140,Ross,"Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that."
141,Chandler,I can see the headline
142,Ross,Why would I eat my own arm?
143,Chandler,"Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want."
144,Monica,"You know what, Ross?"
145,Monica,I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.
146,Ross,Why?
147,Monica,"Because I know that you think the lottery is ""boohaki"" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun."
148,Monica,"And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this."
149,Ross,"You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself."
150,Ross,But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet!
151,Ross,Come here
152,Phoebe,Get a room!
153,Chandler,"Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?"
154,Ross,"I don't know, probably just invest it."
155,Chandler,Ooh!
156,Chandler,Calm down ...
157,Joey,"Seriously, that's your fantasy?"
158,Joey,To invest it?
159,Ross,"Oh, I'm sorry, did I say ""invest it""?"
160,Ross,"I meant ""be cool and piss it all away"""
161,Joey,"Ooh, ooh, I know!"
162,Joey,We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!
163,Rachel,I don't really care about the Knicks.
164,Joey,"Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward."
165,Rachel,You would do that?
166,Rachel,I never get picked!
167,Chandler,"You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go."
168,Joey,You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks??
169,Joey,I can't believe you're taking this away from me!
170,Chandler,"You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds."
171,Ross,"Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?"
172,Chandler,I'll take this one too  Uh ... Mommy?
173,Ross,"Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel ""Mommy"" when we're around Emma."
174,Ross,Which I now realize we are not ...
175,Rachel,I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.
176,Ross,"Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me ""Daddy"" too."
177,Phoebe,"Oooh, I like that, ""daddy"""
178,Ross,I ...
179,Ross,I was just talking about Rachel.
180,Phoebe,"Oooh, is daddy getting angry?"
181,Phoebe,Is daddy gonna spank me?
182,Ross,Well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi ..  no I can't.
183,Chandler,Hello?
184,Chandler,Hello?
185,Chandler,"Oh, hey Charlie."
186,Chandler,Did anybody else hear?
187,Chandler,... What?
188,Chandler,Susan got it??
189,Chandler,How?
190,Chandler,"Oh man, I would have slept with him!!"
191,Chandler,".. Alright, bye."
192,Joey,"Dude, I'm sorry."
193,Joey,"But hey, there's one spot left, right?"
194,Chandler,"Well no, Charlie's gonna get that."
195,Monica,"Hey, don't say that!"
196,Monica,You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!
197,Chandler,He's the boss's son.
198,Monica,"Come on, lottery!"
199,Rachel,"Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes."
200,Monica,"Ok, here we go."
201,Monica,We need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won.
202,Monica,So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this?
203,Monica,"Ok, how about"
204,Rachel,"Ooh, I have another idea!"
205,Monica,"I'm sorry, idea time is over."
206,Phoebe,"Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?"
207,Monica,Yeah.
208,Chandler,What about the ones you have on the nightstand?
209,Monica,There are no tickets on the nightstand!
210,Chandler,"Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago."
211,Monica,"Un, no you didn't!"
212,Monica,You must be mistaken!
213,Chandler,"Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!"
214,Monica,"Chandler, sense the tone!"
215,Rachel,"Well, well, well, look what mommy found!"
216,Monica,"Ok, fine!!"
217,Monica,I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.
218,Phoebe,Uh!
219,Phoebe,The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.
220,Ross,"I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together!"
221,Monica,"Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!"
222,Ross,3 minutes ago!!!
223,Ross,I don't know why that's important ...
224,Joey,"I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those?"
225,Monica,When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!
226,Joey,I'll show you how.
227,Rachel,"Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your ""special"" tickets win?"
228,Rachel,How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?
229,Monica,"Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me."
230,Monica,Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!
231,Rachel,"Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?"
232,Chandler,"She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ..."
233,Monica,Ahhh!
234,Chandler,"Let me finish ...  however, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!"
235,Monica,There's the man I married!
236,Rachel,"All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!"
237,Monica,Fine!
238,Monica,Don't be my friends!
239,Monica,I'll buy new friends!
240,Monica,"Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!"
241,Rachel,OH!
242,Rachel,"Alright, you know what?"
243,Rachel,That's it!
244,Rachel,I want my share of the tickets !
245,Joey,"Yeah, I want my tickets too !"
246,Joey,And I'm buying the Knicks!
247,Joey,"And Steffi Graff, ah ah!"
248,Ross,"Than I want mine, too !"
249,Ross,And if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.
250,Phoebe,"Oh, you guys!"
251,Phoebe,We've got to keep all the tickets together
252,Monica,"No, no!"
253,Monica,We should divide them up  and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!
254,Joey,"Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me!"
255,Joey,This all thing was my idea!
256,Chandler,"Oh, yeah!"
257,Chandler,Thanks for inventing the lottery!
258,Rachel,"Ok, that's it!"
259,Rachel,Just give'em to me!
260,Rachel,I'll split them up!
261,Joey,Oh!
262,Phoebe,OOOOOHHHHH!
263,Ross,"Hey, hey!"
264,Phoebe,OOOOOHHHHH!
265,Phoebe,"Fine, I can't take it anymore!"
266,Phoebe,I'm putting an end to this!
267,Rachel,"Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets."
268,Joey,"No, no!"
269,Phoebe,"If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all!"
270,Phoebe,"So, say goodbye to your tickets!"
271,Phoebe,Don't come any closer!
272,Chandler,"Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished..."
273,Phoebe,"No, what's more important, your friends or money?"
274,Phoebe,Everyone but
275,Monica,Friends!
276,Monica,Money!
277,Monica,Friends...
278,Phoebe,"Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?"
279,Monica,They're all in there!
280,Monica,Even these five that I hid in my bra ...
281,Ross,Monica!
282,Phoebe,"Ok, good!"
283,Phoebe,You guys were so scared!
284,Phoebe,"There was no way I was gonna dump this... Oh God, no!"
285,Phoebe,I think I broke your bowl.
286,Ross,"Go, go, go!"
287,Phoebe,"What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets."
288,Phoebe,And the wind sure made it fun.
289,Monica,"Phoebe, we lost half of them."
290,Phoebe,"So, what?"
291,Phoebe,"Monica, we have the winning ticket!"
292,Phoebe,"My psychic said I  was gonna win, remember?"
293,Ross,Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...
294,Phoebe,As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die.
295,Phoebe,"So, excuse me for being a little skittish."
296,Chandler,"Hey, there's two messages."
297,Chandler,These could be from work!
298,Monica,"Oh, play them!"
299,Chandler,"Ok, here we go!"
300,Phoebe,"Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do."
301,Phoebe,Second
302,Chandler,This is..shhh!
303,Chandler,Second
304,Monica,"Oh God, I am so sorry honey..."
305,Rachel,"Oh, it is so unfair."
306,Rachel,It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.
307,Chandler,"Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?"
308,Rachel,"No, she was just much better at job than me!"
309,Phoebe,"Guys, the drawing is about to start!"
310,Rachel,You know what?
311,Rachel,We should call my mum's house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.
312,Ross,"Oh yeah, it's a good idea!"
313,Monica,"Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job."
314,Chandler,"Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it."
315,Chandler,But... let's go win the lottery...
316,Chandler,"I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?"
317,Monica,131!
318,Ross,Goodnight sweetheart!
319,Ross,I love you.
320,Ross,"And remember, you're daddy's little girl...  Phoebe's totally ruined that for me..."
321,Rachel,"Hi mum, put her back on!"
322,Joey,"Rach, come on!"
323,Joey,They are announcing the numbers!
324,Joey,"My God, I can already feel myself changing."
325,Chandler,I got that!
326,Ross,"Oh, we have one too!"
327,Monica,"We are on a roll, people!"
328,Ross,Come on!
329,Rachel,"Mum, please!I know you love your new lips, but I can barely understand you!"
330,Rachel,"Would you, please, just let me say goodnight to my daughter?"
331,Monica,Check your numbers!
332,Monica,Make me rich!
333,Rachel,"Guys, you're not gonna believe this!"
334,Rachel,I was just saying goodnight to Emma and she said her first words!
335,Joey,And what did she say?
336,Rachel,"She said ""gleba""!"
337,Monica,Make me rich!
338,Rachel,Isn't that amazing?
339,Ross,"Oh yeah, no no no...that's great!"
340,Rachel,Why-why aren't you more excited?
341,Ross,"Oh, Rach...oh...""gleba"" is not a word."
342,Rachel,"Oh, but of course it is!"
343,Ross,"Okay, what does it mean?"
344,Rachel,I don't know all the words.
345,Ross,"I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first words ."
346,Ross,"Yes you did, gleba is a word!"
347,Ross,"Ok, use it in a sentence."
348,Rachel,"Ok... ""Emma just said gleba""!"
349,Ross,It's not a word!
350,Rachel,"Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up ."
351,Ross,"Oh, oh, ok, great."
352,Ross,"You know what, while you're at it she said another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look"
353,Rachel,"Alright, okay, okay, gleba, gleba...  Gleba!"
354,Rachel,Ha!
355,Rachel,Here it
356,Ross,She's gonna be a scientist!
357,Joey,Damnit!
358,Joey,anybody got anything?
359,Chandler,No.
360,Phoebe,I'm still looking through mine...
361,Monica,"Just double checking ...no, no, no... No!"
362,Monica,Hello?
363,Monica,Hold on.
364,Monica,It's your boss.
365,Chandler,"Ah, the ""I'm sorry I rejected you"" phone call."
366,Chandler,I'm not used to getting it from guys.
367,Chandler,"Hey, Steve."
368,Chandler,"Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant!"
369,Chandler,"Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff!"
370,Chandler,"And I'm not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!"
371,Chandler,"Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?"
372,Chandler,"Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it."
373,Chandler,I'll see you tomorrow .
374,Chandler,What?
375,Chandler,"Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter."
376,Monica,"Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!"
377,Chandler,Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
378,Monica,You bet!
379,Monica,No TV or anything!
380,Joey,"Hey, that is so great about the job."
381,Chandler,"Thanks, man."
382,Joey,And I like to think I had a little something to do with it.
383,Chandler,Really?
384,Chandler,What?
385,Joey,"Well, before, with the wishbone..."
386,Joey,"I didn't wish we would win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job."
387,Chandler,Oh yeah?
388,Chandler,"Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart right out."
389,Joey,Oh yeah.
390,Rachel,You know what?
391,Rachel,There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.
392,Ross,Me too.
393,Ross,So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme park.
394,Phoebe,"You guys, what was the Powerball number again?"
395,Phoebe,Monica and
396,Ross,Seven.
397,Phoebe,We won.
398,Rachel,What?
399,Phoebe,We won!
400,Monica,Let me see!
401,Phoebe,Don't tear it.
402,Ross,"Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers."
403,Phoebe,"I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number, we've won 3 dollars!"
404,Chandler,"Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout."
405,Phoebe,"I don't care, I've never won anything before, I can't believe this!"
406,Rachel,"So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?"
407,Phoebe,It's not all mine.
408,Phoebe,We all get 50 cents.
409,Monica,You know what?
410,Monica,You can have mine.
411,Chandler,Me too.
412,Joey,Me too.
413,Rachel,Me too.
414,Ross,I guess if everybody else is...
415,Ross,Closing credits
416,Joey,"Hey guys, so I just called the Powerball hotline, can you believe it?"
417,Joey,Nobody won.
418,Phoebe,I beg to differ .
419,Phoebe,"Coo, again."
420,Phoebe,Don't blame the pretty lady.
421,Phoebe,It was not her fault.
422,Phoebe,"It was me, the pigeon, coo!"
423,Phoebe,"Seriously, stop staring at her."
0,Phoebe,Oh hey!
1,Phoebe,How was your audition?
2,Joey,"I'm sorry, do I know you?"
3,Phoebe,What are you doing?
4,Joey,"Nothing, I'm just practicing blowing you off because I'm gonna be a big movie star!"
5,Phoebe,Oh!
6,Phoebe,You got it?
7,Joey,"Well, no not yet."
8,Joey,But the audition went really good.
9,Monica,What was it for?
10,Joey,"Oh, it's this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century."
11,Joey,It's really classy!
12,Joey,"Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese."
13,Phoebe,"The next, next?"
14,Joey,"Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right?"
15,Joey,But then this guy's right after him.
16,Joey,Hello!

18,Joey,Oh my God!
19,Joey,Are you kidding me?

21,Joey,Oh.
22,Joey,"Uh, okay uh let me call you back."
23,Phoebe,What's the matter?
24,Joey,They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
25,Monica,Wow!

27,Joey,My grandmother's gonna see this!
28,Phoebe,Grandma's gonna have to get in line.
29,Phoebe,Opening Credits
30,Phoebe,Hey the wedding is so close!
31,Phoebe,Are you getting nervous?
32,Monica,Yeah.
33,Monica,But a part of me also can't wait til it's over.
34,Monica,Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
35,Ross,A no sex pact huh?
36,Ross,I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
37,Monica,"Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?"
38,Phoebe,Sure.
39,Monica,I gotta make up the guest bedroom.
40,Monica,"Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days."
41,Ross,Cassie?
42,Monica,Uh-hmm.
43,Ross,"Wow, I haven't seen her for like forever."

45,Monica,"Ross, she's 25 years old."
46,Ross,So what!
47,Ross,I still haveNo you're probably right.
48,Rachel,Hi!

59,Monica,Sorry.
60,Rachel,Oh my God!
61,Rachel,We have to throw her a shower?
62,Monica,Hey!
63,Monica,What did you decide to do about the movie?
64,Joey,I don't know!
65,Joey,It's not like it's porn!
66,Joey,"This is a serious, legitimate movie."
67,Joey,Y'know?
68,Joey,And the nudity is really important to the story.
69,Monica,That's what you say about porn.
70,Joey,You're right.
71,Joey,Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.
72,Monica,No!
73,Monica,No you should!
74,Monica,A lot of major actors do nude scenes!
75,Monica,I mean the chance to star in a movie?
76,Monica,Come on!
77,Joey,Well that's true.
78,Joey,And I am only naked in one scene.
79,Joey,Plus it sounds really great.
80,Joey,My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl.
81,Joey,Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm.
82,Joey,So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other.
83,Joey,It's really sweet and-and tender.
84,Monica,"Plus, everyone's gonna see your thing."
85,Phoebe,Well when can we have this shower?
86,Rachel,She has got so much going on we-we have only two options.
87,Rachel,We have Friday
88,Phoebe,Well that's only two days away.
89,Phoebe,What is the other option?
90,Rachel,Yesterday!
91,Phoebe,"Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo!"
92,Phoebe,We're done!
93,Rachel,"Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible!"
94,Rachel,We can't do this by Friday!
95,Rachel,We have to find a place.
96,Rachel,We have to invite people!
97,Rachel,We have to get food!
98,Rachel,There's just too much to do!
99,Rachel,It's impossible!
100,Rachel,We can't do it!
101,Rachel,We cannot do it!
102,Rachel,We cannot do it!
103,Phoebe,"Rachel, calm down!"
104,Rachel,Okay.
105,Rachel,I'm sorry.
106,Rachel,"You're right, you're right."
107,Phoebe,Just calm down woman!
108,Rachel,"Phoebe, I already, I already did."
109,Phoebe,Oh okay.
110,Phoebe,"All right, then I need to calm down a little."
111,Rachel,Okay.
112,Rachel,Okay.
113,Rachel,I think we can do this if we just get organized.
114,Rachel,All right?
115,Rachel,We have two days to plan this party.
116,Rachel,We just need to make fast decisions!
117,Rachel,Okay?
118,Rachel,"All right, where are we gonna have it?"
119,Phoebe,"Uh, here."
120,Phoebe,What time?
121,Rachel,4 o'clock.
122,Rachel,Food?
123,Phoebe,Finger sandwiches and tea.
124,Rachel,Ooh great!
125,Rachel,Very Monica.
126,Phoebe,And chili!
127,Rachel,Ah you went one too far.
128,Rachel,"Uh, flowers or balloons?"
129,Phoebe,Both!
130,Rachel,We're paying for this y'know.
131,Phoebe,Neither.
132,Rachel,Okay.
133,Rachel,"Umm, what should we do for the theme?"
134,Phoebe,Lusts of the flesh.
135,Rachel,What?
136,Phoebe,I don't know.
137,Phoebe,A cowboy theme?
138,Chandler,Hey!
139,Monica,Hey!
140,Chandler,Y'know I'm-I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
141,Monica,Oh boy me too!
142,Chandler,Y'know I was thinking if we had aa big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours
143,Monica,Yeah?
144,Chandler,Technically we could have sex again.
145,Chandler,"What do you think, bossy and domineering?"
146,Monica,"The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!"
147,Chandler,That's me!
148,Chandler,Come on!
149,Monica,Okay.
150,Monica,"But wait, we can't."
151,Monica,"My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch."
152,Chandler,"Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill."
153,Monica,Shrill?!
154,Monica,The wedding is back on!
155,Chandler,Hi!
156,Chandler,Nice to meet you!
157,Monica,"So, are you ready to go?"
158,Monica,Chandler!
159,Chandler,I'll be right with you.
160,Monica,Cassie needs to stay at your place.
161,Ross,Whatwhy?
162,Monica,Because Purvry Perverson over here can't stop staring at her.
163,Ross,What?!
164,Ross,Chandler she's our cousin!
165,Chandler,I was not staring at her.
166,Chandler,Okay?
167,Chandler,I was just listening intently.
168,Chandler,It's called being a good conversationalist.
169,Chandler,Watch.
170,Chandler,Say something.
171,Monica,You were staring about eight inches south of there.
172,Ross,"Fine, she can stay at my place."
173,Ross,"By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now."
174,Monica,She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
175,Chandler,"Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?"
176,Monica,Wafer thin ice!
177,Joey,"Hey, I'm back!"
178,Joey,The Casting
179,Joey,"Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?"
180,Joey,The Casting
181,Joey,Oh great!
182,Joey,"Y'know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever!"
183,Joey,"Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie!"
184,Joey,Good day!
185,Joey,The Casting
186,Joey,And scene!
187,Joey,Huh?
188,Joey,Wasn't that fun?
189,Joey,We did a little improv there.
190,Joey,Yeah!
191,Joey,Okay!
192,Joey,So you-you-you-you were saying?
193,Joey,The Casting
194,Joey,Wow!
195,Joey,Sure!
196,Joey,That's great!
197,Joey,The Casting
198,Joey,Yeah!
199,Joey,"Yeah sure, just long as it's handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold."
200,Joey,The Casting
201,Joey,SoWhat?
202,Joey,The Casting
203,Joey,Yes!
204,Joey,The Casting
205,Joey,No.
206,Joey,What?
207,Joey,The Casting
208,Joey,Barmifsaed?
209,Monica,So to get this part you can't be?
210,Joey,Nope.
211,Monica,But you are?
212,Joey,Yep.
213,Monica,But you told them you weren't?
214,Joey,That's right.
215,Monica,Wow!
216,Monica,Wow!
217,Monica,And it's definitely all gone?
218,Monica,There's nothing there to work with?
219,Monica,What were you thinking?
220,Joey,I don't know!
221,Joey,I really want this part!
222,Joey,And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes.
223,Joey,"Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell em you can!"
224,Joey,And just figure out how to do it later.
225,Monica,Joey!
226,Monica,This is not like learning to ride a horse!
227,Monica,This is like learning togrow a turtleneck!
228,Joey,I kn-I know!
229,Joey,I know!
230,Joey,Okay?
231,Joey,And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
232,Monica,"Oh my God, what are you gonna do?"
233,Joey,I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.
234,Monica,Unless!
235,Joey,Unless what?
236,Monica,"Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion."
237,Joey,Like what?
238,Monica,"Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat."
239,Phoebe,Hey!
240,Phoebe,I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower.
241,Phoebe,"Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone."
242,Rachel,Okay.
243,Rachel,Okay.
244,Rachel,"All right, you take care of that."
245,Rachel,"And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list."
246,Phoebe,Okay.
247,Phoebe,Okay!
248,Phoebe,"Well okay, who do we know that's coming?"
249,Phoebe,Me.
250,Phoebe,Are you?
251,Monica,Hey!
252,Phoebe,Hey!
253,Rachel,Hey!
254,Rachel,What's up Mon?
255,Monica,"Well uh, I'm trying to make something for Joey."
256,Monica,Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
257,Rachel,Have at it.
258,Monica,Okay.
259,Monica,"All right, turkey."
260,Monica,"Eh, that won't work."
261,Monica,Cheese?

297,Ross,Uh-huh!

316,Phoebe,"Hmm, y'know there's another word for people like that."
317,Phoebe,Losers!

331,Phoebe,"Fine, I'll go call her."
332,Rachel,Yes!
333,Rachel,And please tell her to bring a cake!
334,Monica,"Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on."
335,Joey,Wow!
336,Joey,This looks great!
337,Monica,Yeah!
338,Monica,"Okay, this one is a mushroom cap."
339,Monica,"Umm, this one is made of bologna."
340,Joey,And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
341,Monica,"Oh, just until the glue dries."
342,Joey,Thank God!

344,Joey,Ah.
345,Monica,Okay?
346,Monica,"Over here we have pink suede, which is nice."
347,Monica,"But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink."
348,Joey,Well maybe we just take that one away.
349,Monica,"I also, did a little something in fur."
350,Monica,"But umm, that's really just for me."
351,Monica,Okay.

371,Ross,She's your cousin!
372,Ross,If she knew what was going on in your head she'd think you were sick!
373,Ross,Or would she?
374,Ross,Let's back up a second.
375,Ross,She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine.
376,Ross,She was the one who turned down the lights.
377,Ross,"She was the one that wanted to rent Logan's Run, the sexiest movie ever."
378,Ross,"Oh, I know that look."
379,Ross,Forget it.
380,Ross,I want it.
381,Ross,She wants it.
382,Ross,I'm going in.

384,Ross,"Okay, doesn't have to be clever, it just has to be words."
385,Ross,Say some words.
386,Ross,Any words will do.
387,Ross,Oh my God!
388,Ross,This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever!
389,Ross,There is nothing you can say to make this worse!!
390,Ross,So just say something!!
391,Ross,"I-I, I uh haven't had sex in a very long time."
392,Ross,"Yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything."

396,Monica,I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice!
397,Monica,Oh.
398,Rachel,"Oh Monica, we are so sorry."
399,Monica,For what?
400,Rachel,"Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower."
401,Phoebe,And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
402,Monica,You al-you already had it?
403,Phoebe,Yeah.
404,Phoebe,"Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave."
405,Rachel,"Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don't have either."
406,Phoebe,We ruined everything.
407,Rachel,Ugh
408,Monica,Well no wait a minute that's not true!
409,Monica,"No, what did, that was really sweet."
410,Monica,And it kinda works out for the best.
411,Rachel,"What do you, what do you mean?"
412,Monica,"Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love!"
413,Monica,"I mean, I get all those presents  without having to talk to people I don't even like!"

121,Joey,"Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?"
122,Phoebe,"Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees."
123,Phoebe,"{Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees!"
124,Phoebe,"Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}"
125,Joey,Great!
126,Joey,Problem solved!
127,Phoebe,But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
128,Joey,"Well, back to square one."
129,Phoebe,"Oh, I know a way that you can decide!"
130,Phoebe,"All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can."

228,Rachel,"Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle."
229,Rachel,My eye is a 100% better.
230,Monica,They're still in my coat.
231,Rachel,Damn!
232,Chandler,Hey!
233,Joey,Hey!
234,Joey,You ready to go?
235,Chandler,"Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there?"
236,Chandler,Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?
237,Chandler,What?
238,Monica,I love you.
239,Monica,{There's another continuity error here.
240,Monica,"Before Monica says I love you, Chandler's holding the vests so that you couldn't see the collar, you could see all three, and they were folding nicely."
241,Monica,"After she says the line and the camera cuts back to Chandler, you can only see two out of the three, you can see the collar of the top one, and it looks like it was folded sloppily, unlike before."
242,Monica,"Hey, you notice things while spending this much time on this!}"
243,Joey,"Man, I wish Ross was coming with us!"
244,Joey,Y'know?
245,Joey,I'm gonna miss him!
246,Phoebe,Thanks a lot!
247,Phoebe,I just got that jerk out of my mind!
248,Chandler,"Hey, so where are we staying?"
249,Chandler,Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
250,Joey,"Uh no, not really."
251,Joey,It's an independent film y'know?
252,Joey,So we don't have a real big budget.
253,Joey,I figured I'd just stay in your room.
254,Chandler,"I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right?"
255,Chandler,"I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?"
256,Joey,Oh yeah!
257,Joey,"For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket."
258,Chandler,So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
259,Joey,Did you not hear the plot of the movie?
260,Joey,"""She's been dead for ten years."""
261,Joey,I'm gonna be a millionaire!
262,Ross,Hey!
263,Joey,Hey!
264,Ross,"I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh?"

273,Chandler,Okay!
274,Joey,Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
275,Rachel,"Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss."
276,Joey,See ya!
277,Rachel,"Well, wait a minute!"
278,Rachel,The puss is good!
279,Rachel,It means it's healing!
280,Ross,"Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading?"
281,Ross,Pheebs?
282,Ross,Hello?
283,Ross,Phoebe?
284,Ross,Phoe-Phoebe!

286,Phoebe,"Oh, I'm sorry."
287,Phoebe,I didn't see you there.
288,Ross,"Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something?"
289,Ross,"'Cause if are please, tell me what it is I did!"
290,Phoebe,"Well, if you don't know I can't help you."
291,Ross,"Well, I don't know."
292,Phoebe,"Well, I can't help you."
293,Ross,"Well, whatever it is I'm-I'm very, very sorry."
294,Ross,Okay?

304,Ross,Will you please tell me what it is I did that mad you so mad at me!
305,Phoebe,I don't know!
306,Phoebe,I don't remember!
307,Ross,"Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?"
308,Phoebe,"Oh no, I am mad at you."
309,Phoebe,I know that much.
310,Phoebe,"But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing."
311,Phoebe,You actually have a very sweet little hiney.
312,Joey,"Man, I'm getting pretty tired."
313,Joey,You're might have to take over soon.
314,Chandler,"We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once."
315,Joey,"Don't worry, it's out there!"
316,Joey,I think I just need lunch.
317,Chandler,Yeah.
318,Joey,You wanna eat?
319,Joey,My treat!
320,Chandler,Isn't that Ross's money?
321,Joey,Yeah.
322,Joey,Okay.
323,Joey,Ross's treat!
324,Joey,Where do you wanna eat?
325,Chandler,I don't know.
326,Joey,"Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide!"

489,Monica,"Well, maybe you should send him something."
490,Monica,So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
491,Chandler,That's a good idea.
492,Chandler,I wonder where I could  get a basket of porn
493,Phoebe,"No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!"
494,Chandler,Really?
495,Phoebe,Y'know what you should send him?

11,Chandler,See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
12,Ross,Why?
13,Ross,Why can't you go to him?

235,Phoebe,The curse is broken!
236,Phoebe,"I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive."
237,Joey,Uh.
238,Phoebe,What?
239,Joey,Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.
240,Phoebe,Oh my God!
241,Phoebe,I killed him!
242,Phoebe,I killed another one!
243,Phoebe,"And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big."
244,Rachel,Well maybe he's just taking a nap.
245,Joey,"I'm tellin' ya, he hasn't moved since this morning."
246,Monica,"All right, we should call somebody."
247,Ross,And tell them what?
248,Ross,The naked guy we stare at all the time isn't moving.
249,Rachel,"Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive."
250,Monica,How are we gonna do that?
251,Monica,There's no way.
252,Joey,"Well, there is one way."
253,Joey,"His window's open, I say, we poke him."
254,Joey,Hey!
255,Joey,"Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?"
256,Chandler,Yeah.
257,Joey,"Well, now we got a reason."
258,Chandler,What?
259,Joey,"Well, we're fashioning a very long poking device."
260,Chandler,All right.
261,Joey,"Hey uh, what's a matter?"
262,Chandler,I talked to Janice.
263,Joey,"Oh my God, is she going back to him?"
264,Chandler,She doesn't know.
265,Chandler,Says she loves us both.
266,Chandler,"Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy."
267,Chandler,Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms.
268,Chandler,"And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept!"
269,Joey,"What are you ah, what are you gonna do?"
270,Chandler,"I don't know, y'know."
271,Chandler,"What, what, would you do?"
272,Joey,"Well, it doesn't matter what I would do."
273,Chandler,"Come on, tell me."
274,Joey,"All right, you're probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me,  I would ah, I would bow out."
275,Chandler,What?
276,Chandler,"What are you, what are you talking about?"
277,Joey,"They have a kid together, y'know."
278,Joey,"They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that."
279,Joey,Are you okay?
280,Joey,"Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?"
281,Ross,"Well, he's finally alseep."
282,Ross,"About that ah, bump on his head?"
283,Rachel,"Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump?"
284,Rachel,"I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child."
285,Ross,"It's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could."
286,Rachel,I did!
287,Ross,I know!
288,Ross,I'm saying you have to watch them all the time.
289,Rachel,I did!!
290,Rachel,I watched!
291,Rachel,I watched!
292,Rachel,I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
293,Ross,Monica did it?
294,Ross,Monica?
295,Monica,Yeah.
296,Ross,"Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?"
297,Monica,No.
298,Monica,Why?
299,Ross,"Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he's leaving out e' and f.'"
300,Ross,"It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head."
301,Monica,Really?
302,Ross,"Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know..."
303,Monica,"Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!"
304,Rachel,I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
305,Monica,You jerk!
306,Monica,You know how much I love that kid!
307,Ross,Monica bang!
308,Ross,Monica bang!
309,Ross,Ow!
310,Rachel,I'll get the hat.
311,Chandler,"Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it's, it's, it's not gonna be easy."
312,Chandler,I think you should go back with Gary.
313,Chandler,"I don't wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy."
314,Chandler,"Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know You're the reason, you are the reason why their not together.'"
315,Chandler,and I hated that guy.
316,Chandler,"And it didn't matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad."
317,Chandler,"Yeah, well."
318,Chandler,It's the right thing to do.
319,Chandler,Then don't leave me!
320,Chandler,"Forget what I said, I was babbling!"
321,Chandler,Pick me!
322,Chandler,No you don't!
323,Chandler,"No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance."
324,Chandler,Ohhh.
325,Chandler,Don't go.
326,Chandler,No.
327,Chandler,No!
328,Chandler,No!
329,Chandler,No!
330,Chandler,I don't care!
331,Chandler,I don't care!
332,Chandler,You can't leave!
333,Chandler,I have your shoe!
334,Joey,"All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area."
335,Ross,"Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance!"
336,Phoebe,I'm telling you he's dead.
337,Phoebe,What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
338,Joey,"All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke."
339,Joey,Steady.
340,Joey,Steady.
341,Joey,"Okay, a little higher."
342,Joey,Careful of the angle.
343,Joey,"Okay, okay, we're approaching the window  Thread the needle."
344,Joey,Thread the needle.
345,Phoebe,He's alive!
346,Phoebe,He's a-live!!
347,Monica,"And yet, we're still poking him."
348,Joey,"Okay, retract the device, retract the device."
349,Ross,He does not look happy.
350,Rachel,"Hey-hey, now he's showing us his poking device."
351,Joey,"Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!"
352,Joey,Closing Credits

4,Rachel,I was just-I was just reading to Emma.
5,Rachel,"Yeah, yeah..."
6,Rachel,"It's... ""climax your way to better skin""."
7,Joey,"So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good."
8,Rachel,"Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!"
9,Joey,Oh hey Rach!
10,Rachel,Yeah...
11,Joey,Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.
12,Rachel,"Oh, well..."
13,Joey,Are you kidding?
14,Joey,Rachel loves to shop!
15,Joey,And she has great taste!
16,Joey,"Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes."
17,Rachel,"Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!"
18,Joey,"Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... ... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!"
19,Phoebe,"Ok, great!"
20,Phoebe,"All right, bye!"
21,Phoebe,Pain in the ass!!
22,Phoebe,"That's off, right?"
23,Joey,"What's the matter, Pheebs?"
24,Phoebe,"Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there."
25,Phoebe,"And she was like ""Oh, don't worry!"
26,Phoebe,I asked him.
27,Phoebe,"He's totally ok with seeing you!""."
28,Phoebe,So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!
29,Rachel,"Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!"
30,Phoebe,Exactly!
31,Rachel,And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
32,Phoebe,I didn't even think about that!
33,Phoebe,"Aaargh, sexual politics!"
34,Rachel,"Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something."
35,Phoebe,"Ok, that'll be great!"
36,Joey,"Oh, ain't that nice?"
37,Joey,The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
38,Rachel,That's not what we're gonna do!
39,Joey,"Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?"
40,Joey,Opening credits
41,Chandler,Wow!
42,Chandler,Fortunately she has a very pretty face!
43,Monica,"Oh, I so can't believe this!"
44,Monica,My uterus is an inhospitable environment?
45,Monica,I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
46,Chandler,"Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!"
47,Chandler,Doctor
48,Chandler,Hi.
49,Monica,Hi.
50,Monica,Doctor
51,Monica,Ok.
52,Monica,Doctor
53,Chandler,"Oh, DAMN IT!"
54,Monica,"Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out."
55,Monica,Doctor
56,Monica,Ok.
57,Monica,Doctor
58,Chandler,Is that a hint?
59,Chandler,Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child!
60,Chandler,"Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!"
61,Rachel,Hi!
62,Rachel,"Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?"
63,Joey,"Alright, have a good time."
64,Rachel,Not gonna find any clothes in there!
65,Ross,"Hey, you guys!"
66,Rachel,Hi.
67,Ross,Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?
68,Ross,"Yeah, right!"
69,Ross,"What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract  Well, why are you laughing?"
70,Joey,"Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!"
71,Ross,"Professor Sherman, yeah."
72,Ross,I've a meeting with him today.
73,Ross,"Yeah, well..."
74,Ross,I think I know how to dazzle him.
75,Rachel,"Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?"
76,Ross,Tsz... NO!
77,Chandler,Hey guys!
78,Ross,"Wait a minute, you guys."
79,Ross,"Oh, I wanna ask you something."
80,Ross,"I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me."
81,Chandler,"I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick."
82,Ross,It's in Barbados.
83,Chandler,But you come first!
84,Rachel,I'm there!
85,Joey,Bye.
86,Rachel,"Bye, see ya."
87,Chandler,Ok.
88,Joey,"All right, so."
89,Joey,How did it go at the fertility clinic?
90,Chandler,Not as much fun as last time.
91,Chandler,Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
92,Ross,So-so what did the doctor say?
93,Chandler,"Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her."
94,Joey,So you're ruling out surrogacy?
95,Chandler,Yeah.
96,Joey,"So, I don't have to learn what that means?"
97,Chandler,"Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors."
98,Joey,"Enough said, I'm there for you man."
99,Joey,"Where is she, upstairs?"
100,Chandler,ah-ha!
101,Ross,How do you feel about all this?
102,Chandler,I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.
103,Joey,"Come on Ross, be a good guy."
104,Joey,Step up and do it!
105,Ross,What?
106,Ross,What?
107,Ross,NO!
108,Ross,I am not going to give them Ben!
109,Ross,The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.
110,Ross,Professor
111,Ross,"I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash."
112,Ross,So-so what I am saying is - is is that  is that the repercussions could be huge!
113,Ross,"I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!"
114,Ross,"Oh, that's not what you want..."
115,Phoebe,"Oh, I'll take some of that."
116,Rachel,"Pheebs, that's for men!"
117,Phoebe,"No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy."
118,Phoebe,Yeah.
119,Phoebe,"Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver."
120,Phoebe,Seriously does anyone buy this?
121,Phoebe,I smell like beets!
122,Rachel,"On Melanie Griffith in ""Working girl""."
123,Rachel,I think what you want is over here.
124,Rachel,Really?
125,Rachel,"Oh, I can't."
126,Rachel,Because I-I've seen them.
127,Rachel,Yeah!
128,Rachel,I'm a big fan!
129,Rachel,"Of the movies, you know."
130,Rachel,Motion pictures.
131,Rachel,The Talkies!
132,Phoebe,"Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?"
133,Rachel,Sure!
134,Phoebe,Ok!
135,Rachel,You know that depends on what it is!
136,Rachel,I've done a lot of stuff.
137,Phoebe,"So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?"
138,Rachel,"She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!"
139,Phoebe,Why?
140,Rachel,"I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall!"
141,Rachel,"You know, and just swept Joey off his feet..."
142,Rachel,"I mean, nobody else has a chance!"
143,Phoebe,Who else?
144,Rachel,Anybody!
145,Rachel,"You, me, you know, Monica's mom..."
146,Phoebe,You like Joey?
147,Rachel,Shhhhh!
148,Rachel,Phoebe!
149,Rachel,"All right, look."
150,Rachel,I have a little thing for him.
151,Phoebe,Oh my God!
152,Rachel,It's just physical and I have it totally under control!
153,Rachel,Ok?
154,Rachel,"It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!"
155,Phoebe,"Uh, wow!"
156,Phoebe,Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?
157,Rachel,"Oh, I get it!"
158,Phoebe,"Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right."
159,Rachel,"I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal."
160,Phoebe,Yeah.
161,Rachel,So can we keep this between us?
162,Phoebe,Sure!
163,Rachel,"Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!"
164,Phoebe,Oh.
165,Phoebe,Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
166,Monica,Hi honey!
167,Chandler,Hey!
168,Chandler,"Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!"
169,Monica,"Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!"
170,Chandler,"You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy!"
171,Chandler,You're both polite!
172,Chandler,"Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer."
173,Monica,I got it.
174,Chandler,"So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?"
175,Monica,"Yeah, I guess."
176,Chandler,"So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!"
177,Monica,Excuse me?
178,Chandler,"Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy!"
179,Chandler,"I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is ""spermtastic""!"
180,Monica,"Chandler, this is crazy!"
181,Monica,What did you even say to him!
182,Monica,"""Come up, meet my wife!"
183,Monica,"Give us your sperm""!"
184,Chandler,"No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him!"
185,Chandler,"I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out."
186,Monica,Chandler!
187,Chandler,"I'm telling you, he's great!"
188,Chandler,"I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!"
189,Monica,I'm not going to be a part of this!
190,Monica,You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!
191,Chandler,Ok!
192,Monica,Uh!
193,Chandler,Zack!
194,Monica,"Tell me about yourself, Zack!"
195,Rachel,"Oh, God, do you think she heard?"
196,Rachel,It would be so bad if she heard!
197,Phoebe,"Well, maybe she didn't hear!"
198,Phoebe,"Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me."
199,Rachel,"Ok, great!"
200,Rachel,"Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!"
201,Phoebe,I didn't say anything yet!
202,Rachel,"Well, get back in there and talk!"
203,Phoebe,I'm Rachel.
204,Phoebe,It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
205,Rachel,What!
206,Phoebe,"Well, some things are just hard to say to your face."
207,Rachel,"Ok well, I heard that!"
208,Rachel,Which means that she heard it too!
209,Phoebe,Ooh!
210,Phoebe,We have a problem.
211,Rachel,Oh!
212,Rachel,What are we gonna do?
213,Rachel,Oh my God!
214,Rachel,Alright!
215,Rachel,Enough out of you!
216,Joey,Hello?
217,Ross,Joey!
218,Ross,"Hey, I need to talk to Charlie."
219,Ross,Is she there?
220,Joey,No.
221,Joey,no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel.
222,Joey,Why?
223,Joey,What's up?
224,Ross,I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
225,Joey,Oh!
226,Joey,How's it going?
227,Ross,It could be better!
228,Ross,"He, uhm... he fell asleep!"
229,Joey,What!?
230,Joey,But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!
231,Ross,Barbados.
232,Joey,"Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...!"
233,Joey,"Ross, you have to get that job!"
234,Ross,What am I supposed to do?
235,Ross,He's out cold!
236,Ross,In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.
237,Joey,"Well, just wake him up!"
238,Ross,I can't!
239,Ross,"If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!"
240,Joey,Uh!
241,Joey,That's a tough one.
242,Joey,Oh!
243,Joey,"Wait a minute, this happened to me before!"
244,Joey,"Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and...  no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!"
245,Monica,Hey guys!
246,Monica,Dinner's ready!
247,Chandler,So what do you think?
248,Chandler,I want that guys genes for my kid!
249,Chandler,"Those eyes, those cheeckbones!"
250,Monica,"Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!"
251,Chandler,You don't like him.
252,Monica,I think he is fine!
253,Monica,It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.
254,Chandler,Alright!
255,Chandler,Just follow my lead!
256,Chandler,Oh!
257,Chandler,"Thanks, I'm crazy about our place."
258,Chandler,Hey!
259,Chandler,speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?
260,Chandler,That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.
261,Monica,"Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story."
262,Monica,I've got a better question for
263,Monica,"Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?"
264,Monica,We're just making conversation.
265,Chandler,You know what's not funny?
266,Chandler,Male Pattern Baldness
267,Chandler,Sure!
268,Chandler,Alright...
269,Chandler,I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth.
270,Chandler,Did you have braces as a child?
271,Monica,Yess!
272,Chandler,We're teeth people Zack!
273,Rachel,Alright!
274,Rachel,Let's just do it.
275,Rachel,Let's just go over there and see if she heard.
276,Phoebe,Good plan.
277,Rachel,Ok.  Wha...?
278,Rachel,where?
279,Rachel,Where are you going?
280,Phoebe,Oh!
281,Phoebe,"I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok?"
282,Phoebe,"I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at ""who's more over who""!"
283,Rachel,"Hey, hi!"
284,Rachel,"Hey, where've you been?"
285,Rachel,Oh!
286,Rachel,Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!?
287,Rachel,"Well, that's so weird!"
288,Rachel,Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room.
289,Rachel,God it's just such a small world!
290,Rachel,Oh God.
291,Rachel,You did.
292,Rachel,You heard.
293,Rachel,"Ok, listen, let me explain."
294,Rachel,Yeah.
295,Rachel,Yeah!
296,Rachel,That's Phoebe.
297,Rachel,That's Phoebe.
298,Rachel,"You know, she just wants them all!"
299,Rachel,It's like she's a nympho!
300,Rachel,Yeah...
301,Rachel,I try...
302,Ross,Oh my God!
303,Ross,You really want me to be the keynote speaker?
304,Ross,Thank you!
305,Ross,Prof.
306,Joey,Wow!
307,Joey,You look... ... stop-eating hot!
308,Joey,Which is like the highest level of hotness!
309,Phoebe,Are you sure?
310,Phoebe,Because I'm really dreading going to this party.
311,Joey,Then don't go!
312,Phoebe,"Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him!"
313,Phoebe,And I don't want to lose face!
314,Phoebe,That's a very serious thing in my culture.
315,Joey,"Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike."
316,Joey,And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!
317,Phoebe,You got it!
318,Phoebe,Ok.
319,Phoebe,"But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room."
320,Phoebe,David?
321,Phoebe,Oh my God!
322,Phoebe,Yeah.

339,Phoebe,"Oh, got it, stay upwind of me."
340,Rachel,"No, that's David."
341,Rachel,Tip of the iceberg.
342,Chandler,You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
343,Chandler,"Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression."
344,Chandler,Ok.
345,Chandler,I think we've found our sperm!
346,Monica,Does seem pretty perfect.
347,Chandler,"Yeah, you think so, well?"
348,Chandler,Should I ask him?
349,Monica,No.
350,Chandler,"Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!"
351,Monica,"No, that's not it."
352,Monica,"It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just..."
353,Monica,I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.
354,Chandler,"Yeah, he's better!"
355,Monica,"No, he's not."
356,Monica,"And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else."
357,Chandler,Really?
358,Chandler,Are you sure?
359,Monica,"Yeah, I'm sure."
360,Chandler,"Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either."
361,Chandler,"You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do."
362,Chandler,"You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm."
363,Monica,That is so sweet.
364,Monica,I love you.
365,Chandler,So you know this leaves us with...
366,Monica,Adoption.
367,Chandler,How do you feel about that?
368,Monica,I think I feel ok about it.
369,Monica,Actually I think I feel really good about it.
370,Chandler,Me too.
371,Chandler,I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you.
372,Chandler,And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
373,Monica,"So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?"
374,Chandler,Yeah.
375,Monica,"Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!"
376,Chandler,We are gonna be great parents.
377,Monica,And it could be soon.
378,Monica,"I mean, think about"
379,Chandler,"Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!"
380,Chandler,Closing credits
381,Chandler,"Hey, Zack!"
382,Chandler,"Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night."
383,Chandler,I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.
384,Chandler,Really?
385,Chandler,"My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions."
386,Chandler,We're working on it.
387,Chandler,"You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?"
388,Chandler,End
0,Ross,You said you'd marry Joey?
1,Rachel,"Okay you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would have said yes to anybody."
2,Rachel,Like that time you and I got married!
3,Rachel,I'm not helping.
4,Ross,"So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?"
5,Rachel,That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but I am prepared to let that go.
6,Ross,"So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend."
7,Rachel,WellReally?
8,Rachel,I thought Chandler was your best friend.
9,Ross,"Well, Chandler's my oldest friend, but Joey's myNo!"

19,Monica,So sexy.
20,Monica,Honey.
21,Chandler,Yea yea.

23,Chandler,"No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office  Am I producing them?"
24,Joey,Why're you so tired?
25,Chandler,"Couldn't sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldn't sleep."
26,Chandler,Y'know?
27,Chandler,"I was like, if I fall asleep now I'll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I'll get five hours sleep."
28,Chandler,Not matter what I did I couldn't fall asleep.
29,Joey,"You know what you should've done, you should have told yourself that little story."
30,Rachel,Hi!

41,Rachel,"I mean, I just had his baby."
42,Joey,That's not fair!
43,Joey,I can't do that.
44,Rachel,"Yeah, I'm not so sure you should be here when he comes up."
45,Joey,"See this is what I was afraid of, I didn't think I should be here either but somebody  said he'd be over it by now."
46,Chandler,"Hey, what do I know?"
47,Chandler,I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
48,Chandler,Walter .
49,Phoebe,She's just so cute!
50,Phoebe,I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.
51,Monica,Phoebe!

53,Ross,Okay I put most of the stuff away.

74,Rachel,God how long do you think that's gonna last?
75,Phoebe,"I dunno, well he got over the ""We were on a break"" thing really quickly."
76,Rachel,"Y'know I can't even worry about that right now, cause I got the cutie little baby, oh I can't believe how much I love her, I can't get enough of her, like right now I miss her."
77,Rachel,I actually miss her.

98,Phoebe,Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!
99,Monica,"Alright here's something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side."
100,Rachel,Ok.
101,Monica,It worked!
102,Rachel,Oh  oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit.

117,Joey,"But I gotta say technically, I didn't even do anything wrong."
118,Ross,What!
119,Ross,You didn't do anything wrong?
120,Joey,I said I didn't technically.
121,Ross,"Okay let's put aside that you  ""accidentally"" picked up my grandmothers ring and you  ""accidentally"" proposed to Rachel."
122,Joey,"Look, can I just stop you right there for a second?"
123,Joey,When people do this  I don't really know what that means.
124,Joey,You were saying?
125,Ross,"And I can even understand that you couldn't tell Rachel, but why couldn't you tell me, huh?"
126,Ross,You had all day to and you didn't.

140,Joey,You'll feel better!
141,Joey,"I'll feel better, and you know you want to."

186,Monica,Okay what's up
187,Chandler,"Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year?"
188,Chandler,"You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?"
189,Monica,Oh yeah .
190,Chandler,"Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?"
191,Monica,What?
192,Monica,Who says that?
193,Chandler,People who've never ever been to Paris.
194,Monica,What's going on?
195,Chandler,We're moving to Tulsa!
196,Monica,Excuse me?
197,Chandler,"Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes."
198,Monica,"Tulsa, Oklahoma!"
199,Chandler,"The Sooner State, whatever that is."

204,Monica,"Are you trying to tell me that we're moving to Oklahoma, or that you're gay?"
205,Monica,"All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?"
206,Chandler,"No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus."
207,Chandler,I'll get out of it.
208,Monica,Thank you.
209,Chandler,What is wrong with Emma?
210,Monica,"Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa."
211,Chandler,"Umm ma'am, do you have a minute?"
212,Chandler,I kind of have some bad news.
213,Chandler,I don't think I can move to Tulsa.
214,Chandler,Ms.
215,Chandler,"It's a funny story, actually."
216,Chandler,"I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said I'd move to Tulsa, I didn't really know what I was saying."
217,Chandler,Ms.
218,Chandler,"But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ain't that funny?"
219,Chandler,Irony?
220,Chandler,"Not a fan, alright ."
221,Chandler,"See, here's the thing."
222,Chandler,I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won't go.
223,Chandler,"See, me, I love Tulsa!"
224,Chandler,Tulsa is heaven!

234,Joey,"Hey, so how is it?"
235,Ross,I broke my thumb.

237,Joey,That's weird.
238,Joey,You sure you're punching right?
239,Joey,Make a fist.
240,Joey,Maybe later.
241,Joey,Ross I feel terrible.
242,Ross,"You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms."
243,Joey,"You, you want me to help you with that?"
244,Ross,"Why, does it look like I'm having trouble with my misshapen claw?"
245,Joey,Name?
246,Joey,I know Ross but what's it short for?

262,Ross,I don't think that we are.
263,Joey,But you two were supposed to be together.
264,Ross,"Well, I thought so too, but then she said she'd marry you."
265,Joey,"Come on, Ross, that didn't mean anything!"
266,Joey,"She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody."
267,Ross,Yeah that's what she said.
268,Joey,So?
269,Ross,So I don't wanna be just anybody.
270,Joey,Wow.
271,Ross,"You know what, it's, it's better this way anyway."
272,Ross,"I mean I don't know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us."
273,Ross,It's just much easier if we're just friends who have a kid.
274,Joey,Really?
275,Ross,Yeah.
276,Joey,And you're Okay with that?
277,Ross,Yes.
278,Ross,"I mean, it's what we always planned."
279,Ross,"And if you have a plan, you should stick to it."
280,Ross,That's why they call them plans.
281,Ross,Hello?
282,Ross,I'm fine.

2,Rachel,I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
3,Ross,"Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes."
4,Rachel,"Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt."
5,Chandler,And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
6,Ross,Hey!
7,Ross,Hey!
8,Ross,"If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!"
9,Ross,It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
10,Joey,"Hey, yeah!"
11,Joey,Then we could do that telephone thing!
12,Joey,"Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!"
13,Chandler,Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
14,Chandler,Opening Credits
15,Ross,Oh my God!
16,Ross,I love this apartment!
17,Ross,Isn't it perfect?!
18,Ross,I can't believe I never realized how great it is!
19,Rachel,Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
20,Phoebe,It's amazing!
21,Phoebe,You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.
22,Ross,Ohh.
23,Rachel,"Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom."
24,Phoebe,"Oh, look!"
25,Phoebe,There's Monica and Chandler!

50,Rachel,I KNOW!
51,Phoebe,YOU KNOW?!!
52,Rachel,"Yes, I know!"
53,Rachel,And Joey knows!

55,Ross,What's going on?
56,Ross,Phoebe and
57,Rachel,Ohhh!!
58,Rachel,HI!!
59,Rachel,Hi!
60,Ross,What?!
61,Ross,What?
62,Rachel,Nothing!
63,Rachel,"Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!"
64,Ross,"Actually, it looks really good."
65,Phoebe,Get in here!!
66,Phoebe,You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping orOh!
67,Phoebe,All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
68,Rachel,"Uh-huh, doing it."
69,Rachel,Doing it.
70,Rachel,Phone doing it.
71,Phoebe,Oh!
72,Phoebe,"Oh, I can't believe it!"
73,Phoebe,I mean I think it's great!
74,Phoebe,For him.
75,Phoebe,She might be able to do better.
76,Joey,Hey guys!
77,Rachel,Joey!
78,Rachel,Come here!
79,Rachel,Come here!
80,Joey,What?
81,Joey,What?
82,Rachel,Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
83,Joey,You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
84,Rachel,No.
85,Rachel,"Joey, she knows!"
86,Rachel,We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window.
87,Rachel,"Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window."
88,Phoebe,"Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?"
89,Joey,"Yes, but y'know what?"
90,Joey,It doesn't matter who knows what.
91,Joey,"Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know!"
92,Joey,Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
93,Phoebe,"Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own."
94,Rachel,Wh-what do you mean?
95,Phoebe,Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
96,Rachel,"Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!"
97,Joey,No-no-no!
98,Joey,"No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun?"
99,Joey,Telling them.
100,Rachel,"Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing."
101,Joey,I can't take any
102,Phoebe,No!
103,Phoebe,You don't have to do anything!
104,Phoebe,Just don't tell them that we know!
105,Joey,Noo!
106,Joey,I can't take any more secrets!
107,Joey,I've got your secrets.
108,Joey,I've got their secrets.
109,Joey,I got secrets of my own y'know!
110,Rachel,You don't have any secrets!
111,Joey,Oh yeah?
112,Joey,"Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal."
113,Rachel,"So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?"
114,Joey,Ugh.
115,Phoebe,"Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate."
116,Rachel,Okay.
117,Phoebe,And then.
118,Phoebe,I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal.
119,Phoebe,My sexuality.
120,Chandler,Hello children!
121,Phoebe,"Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie."
122,Chandler,Hey.
123,Phoebe,Hey!
124,Phoebe,"Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!"
125,Chandler,Really?
126,Phoebe,Yeah the material feels so softhello Mr. Bicep!
127,Phoebe,Have you been working out?
128,Chandler,"Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things."
129,Chandler,Are you okay?
130,Phoebe,"Well, if you really wanna know, I'mOh!"
131,Phoebe,I can't tell you this.
132,Chandler,"Phoebe, it's me."
133,Chandler,You can tell me anything.
134,Phoebe,Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too.
135,Phoebe,And the one person I want to the most.
136,Chandler,What's going on?
137,Phoebe,"I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don't even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffeeOh no, have I said to much?"
138,Phoebe,Well it's just something to think about.
139,Phoebe,I know I will.
140,Monica,You are so cute!
141,Monica,How did you get to be so cute?
142,Chandler,"Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny."
143,Monica,"Okay, now you're even cuter!"
144,Chandler,Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
145,Monica,What?
146,Chandler,"The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me."
147,Monica,What are you talking about?
148,Chandler,I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
149,Monica,That's not possible!
150,Chandler,Ow!
151,Monica,"I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way."
152,Chandler,"Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough."
153,Monica,"I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her."
154,Chandler,"No, I didn't misunderstand, okay?"
155,Chandler,She was all over me!
156,Chandler,She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
157,Monica,This bicep?
158,Chandler,Well it's not flexed right now!
159,Rachel,"Hey Mon, what are you doing now?"
160,Rachel,Wanna come see a movie with us?
161,Monica,"Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry."
162,Rachel,Oh.
163,Monica,"Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?"
164,Chandler,"Sure, I'll do it with ya."
165,Monica,Okay.
166,Rachel,"Okay great, hold on a sec!"
167,Rachel,"Oh, here you go!"
168,Rachel,You don't mind do ya?
169,Rachel,That would really help me out a lot!
170,Rachel,Thanks!
171,Monica,I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
172,Phoebe,I have quarters!
173,Ross,Hey!
174,Rachel,Hey Ross!
175,Rachel,Any word on the apartment yet?
176,Ross,"Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants."
177,Rachel,Oh.
178,Ross,"No-no, I got the edge."
179,Ross,I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to  tip the scales in my direction.
180,Ross,"Check it out, you can probably see it from the window."
181,Monica,"Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?"
182,Ross,No.
183,Chandler,That new mountain bike?
184,Ross,No.
185,Monica,Well what did you send?
186,Ross,A basket of mini-muffins.
187,Phoebe,But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets.
188,Phoebe,Which one did you send?
189,Ross,The small one.
190,Rachel,What?!
191,Rachel,You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
192,Ross,Well yeah!
193,Ross,Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins.
194,Ross,It was the best day.
195,Chandler,Your work makes me sad.
196,Ross,Oh man!
197,Ross,I want that place so much!!
198,Ross,I was so sure that was gonna work!
199,Ross,There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
200,Rachel,"All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie."
201,Monica,Bye!
202,Phoebe,Bye Chandler!
203,Phoebe,I miss you already.
204,Chandler,"Okay, did you see that?!"
205,Chandler,With the inappropriate and the pinching!
206,Monica,"Actually, I did!"
207,Chandler,"Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?"
208,Monica,"Ohhh, oh my God!"
209,Monica,Oh my God!
210,Monica,She knows about us!
211,Chandler,Are you serious?
212,Monica,Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out!
213,Monica,That's the only explanation for it!
214,Chandler,Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging bicepsShe knows!
215,Chandler,Commercial Break
216,Chandler,Joey!
217,Joey,Yeah?
218,Chandler,Phoebe knows about us!
219,Joey,Well I didn't tell them!
220,Monica,Them?!
221,Monica,Who's them?
222,Joey,"Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey."
223,Monica,Joey!
224,Joey,And Rachel.
225,Joey,I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
226,Chandler,Oh man!
227,Joey,I'm sorry!
228,Joey,"But hey, it's over now, right?"
229,Joey,Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
230,Monica,Unless
231,Joey,No!
232,Joey,Not unless!
233,Joey,Look this must end now!
234,Monica,"Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us!"
235,Monica,But see they don't know that we know that they know!
236,Monica,So
237,Chandler,"Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!"
238,Ross,Noooo.
239,Rachel,"Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!"
240,Phoebe,"Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?"
241,Ross,Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
242,Rachel,Y'know what you should do?
243,Ross,Huh?
244,Rachel,You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him.
245,Rachel,Yeah!
246,Rachel,"Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches."
247,Rachel,"Or uh, or my underwear."
248,Joey,I'm listening.
249,Rachel,See?
250,Ross,That is a great idea!
251,Ross,And!
252,Ross,I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge!
253,Ross,"Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline."
254,Phoebe,He broke that.
255,Ross,"Well, he had gravity boots."
256,Rachel,"Yeah, he broke those too."
257,Joey,So he likes to break stuff.
258,Ross,"Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out."
259,Ross,"Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?"
260,Phoebe,"I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out."
261,Joey,"Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming."
262,Ross,Right.
263,Rachel,Hello!
264,Rachel,Oh yeah!
265,Rachel,Hey!
266,Rachel,Hold on a second she's right here!
267,Rachel,It's Chandler.
268,Phoebe,Oh?
269,Phoebe,Hello you.
270,Chandler,"Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day."
271,Phoebe,Eh?
272,Chandler,"Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued."
273,Phoebe,Really?
274,Chandler,"Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep."
275,Chandler,Or maybe more.
276,Phoebe,I'll have to get back to you on that.
277,Phoebe,"Okay, bye!"
278,Phoebe,Oh my God!
279,Phoebe,He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
280,Rachel,Are you kidding?
281,Phoebe,No!
282,Rachel,I can not believe he would do that to MonWhoa!
283,Rachel,"Joey, do they know that we know?"
284,Joey,No.
285,Rachel,Joey!
286,Joey,They know you know.
287,Rachel,"Ugh, I knew it!"
288,Rachel,Oh I cannot believe those two!
289,Phoebe,"God, they thought they can mess with us!"
290,Phoebe,They're trying to mess with us?!
291,Phoebe,They don't know that we know they know we know!
292,Phoebe,"Joey, you can't say anything!"
293,Joey,I couldn't even if I wanted too.
294,Ross,"Good evening, sir."
295,Ross,My name is Ross Geller.
296,Ross,I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment.
297,Ross,And I-I realize that the competition is fierce butI'm sorry.
298,Ross,"I, I can't help but notice you're naked and  I applaud you."
299,Ross,"Man, I wish I was naked."
300,Ross,"I mean, this-this looks so great."
301,Ross,That is how God intended it.
302,Monica,"Look at them, they're-they're panicked!"
303,Chandler,"Oh yeah, they're totally gonna back down!"
304,Monica,Oh yeah!
305,Phoebe,All right.
306,Phoebe,All right!
307,Phoebe,If he wants a date?
308,Phoebe,He's gonna get a date.
309,Phoebe,"All right, I'm gonna go in."
310,Rachel,All right.
311,Rachel,Be sexy.
312,Phoebe,Please.
313,Phoebe,"So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight."
314,Chandler,Really?
315,Phoebe,Oh absolutely.
316,Phoebe,"Shall we say, around seven?"
317,Chandler,Yes.

330,Phoebe,"And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses?"
331,Monica,"All right, it'll be great!"
332,Monica,You just make her think you wanna have sex with her!
333,Monica,It'll totally freak her out!
334,Chandler,"Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?"
335,Monica,"Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!"
336,Chandler,How do you know?
337,Monica,Because you're on my team!

365,Chandler,You look good.
366,Phoebe,Thanks!
367,Phoebe,"Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!"
368,Chandler,"Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?"
369,Phoebe,Really?

390,Joey,I like that!
391,Joey,"Oh, okay!"

394,Joey,Can't work 'em!
395,Phoebe,Joey!
396,Phoebe,"Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons."
397,Joey,It's not my first time.

399,Chandler,"Okay, give me a second!"
400,Chandler,Did you clean up in here?

4,Ross,I know!
5,Monica,"Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?"
6,Chandler,"Where did you, when did you, how did you...  How did you get a girl like that?"
7,Rachel,"Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?"
8,Ross,"Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era."
9,Chandler,"Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era."
10,Ross,"I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh?"
11,Ross,"But, uh, I made her dinner."
12,Ross,We had a great time.

16,Ross,Opening Credits
17,Chandler,Hi.
18,Chandler,You guys have any wrapping paper?

27,Rachel,"Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit!"
28,Rachel,"Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!"
29,Chandler,"Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils."
30,Rachel,Huh.
31,Rachel,"Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair."
32,Rachel,So this is pretty rare.
33,Rachel,How did you get that?
34,Chandler,"Oh, it wasn't a big deal."
35,Chandler,"I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren."
36,Rachel,"Oh, honey, that's so sweet."
37,Phoebe,"Yeah, and what a great way to say, ""I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"""
38,Chandler,It doesn't say that.
39,Chandler,Does it?
40,Ross,How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
41,Chandler,"Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great."
42,Phoebe,It's gotta be better than that book.
43,Phoebe,Oo!
44,Phoebe,Like a crossbow!
45,Monica,"Yeah, once again, I am sorry."
46,Monica,Thank you.
47,Monica,Bye.
48,Monica,I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
49,Rachel,Oh my God!
50,Rachel,What happened?
51,Monica,Sixty guests.
52,Ross,"So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?"
53,Monica,Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice.
54,Monica,I mean there's no way.
55,Phoebe,"Wow, what is with all the negativity?"
56,Phoebe,"You sound like Monican't , not Monican...  ...Monica."
57,Phoebe,"Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years."
58,Phoebe,Do you want to be a caterer or not?
59,Monica,I don't know.
60,Phoebe,"There you go, that's the spirit!"
61,Phoebe,Okay!
62,Phoebe,"Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!"
63,Monica,Really?
64,Monica,Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.
65,Phoebe,Okay!
66,Phoebe,"It's worth it, if it will get you moving."
67,Phoebe,You haven't worked in months.
68,Monica,"Well, you're not working either."
69,Phoebe,"Yes, but I'm doing this."
70,Monica,"Yeah, that'd be great!"
71,Monica,Thank you!
72,Joey,Hey!
73,Joey,Why?
74,Joey,You can pee here!
75,Chandler,"It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway."
76,Chandler,Hey Joe!
77,Chandler,What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?
78,Joey,"We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?"
79,Rachel,"Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice."
80,Joey,"Oh, I know..."
81,Rachel,"And not one of your coupons for an hour of ""Joey Love."""
82,Phoebe,"Ooo, a crossword!"
83,Phoebe,Can I help?
84,Rachel,No!
85,Rachel,"I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help."
86,Phoebe,Fine.
87,Phoebe,But you can't help me develop my new universal language.
88,Monica,Hey!
89,Rachel,"Hey, how'd it go?"
90,Monica,"Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever!"
91,Monica,"I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what?"
92,Monica,I even got another funeral for tomorrowthe dead-guy-from-today's best friend.
93,Monica,"I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!"
94,Phoebe,Mon!
95,Phoebe,I'm so happy for you!
96,Monica,Thanks.
97,Monica,"Like, check out my new catering stuff."
98,Monica,Look at this!
99,Monica,I'm an omelet station!
100,Monica,Omelet?
101,Monica,Made to order!
102,Phoebe,"I'll have one, please."
103,Phoebe,Plus my money.
104,Monica,Oh.
105,Monica,"Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away."
106,Monica,"I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer."
107,Monica,So I went.
108,Monica,I beed.
109,Monica,"I mean, I..."
110,Monica,I used it to buy all this stuff.
111,Monica,"But lookI've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that."
112,Phoebe,Oh.
113,Phoebe,Okay.
114,Phoebe,"Oo, sorry I acted like a bank."
115,Monica,Okay.
116,Ross,Huh...
117,Ross,Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?
118,Ross,Mitzi is.....
119,Ross,"Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh  ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?"
120,Ross,"Well, I do!"
121,Ross,"Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh..."
122,Ross,"Oh, yeah, why not?"
123,Monica,"Oh, is everything in the car?"
124,Phoebe,Yes.
125,Phoebe,Did you settle the bill?
126,Monica,No.
127,Monica,I hate this part.
128,Phoebe,"Oh, look what we almost left."
129,Monica,"No, that's not mine."
130,Phoebe,"Oh, all right."
131,Phoebe,Oh!
132,Phoebe,Look what we almost took!
133,Monica,"Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart?"
134,Monica,"Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen."
135,Monica,Mrs.
136,Monica,"Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...   Mrs."
137,Monica,Just the matter of ...payment?
138,Monica,Mrs.
139,Rachel,You know what we should all do?
140,Rachel,Go see a musical.
141,Chandler,Sure...
142,Rachel,And you know which one we should see?
143,Rachel,The 1996 Tony award winner.
144,Rachel,Do you happen to know the name of that one?
145,Chandler,"I don't know... um, Grease?"
146,Rachel,No....
147,Chandler,Rent?
148,Rachel,Yes!
149,Rachel,Rent!
150,Chandler,"Okay, so when do you want to go?"
151,Rachel,What?
152,Rachel,"Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy."
153,Joey,Hey.
154,Joey,"Man, it is so hard to shop for girls."
155,Chandler,"Yes, it is, at Office Max."
156,Rachel,What did you get her?
157,Chandler,A pen.
158,Joey,It's two gifts in one.
159,Joey,It's a pen that's also a clock!
160,Joey,Huh?
161,Chandler,Huh-huh!
162,Chandler,You can't give her that.
163,Joey,Why not?
164,Chandler,Because she's not eleven!
165,Chandler,And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
166,Rachel,"Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?"
167,Joey,Sure it is!
168,Joey,"She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... ""Whoa!"
169,Joey,"It's time for my date with Joey!"""
170,Chandler,"All right, look, look."
171,Chandler,What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
172,Joey,She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
173,Chandler,For three years?
174,Joey,"Look, it's too late, and I got an audition."
175,Joey,I can't shop anymore!
176,Joey,I...
177,Chandler,All right.
178,Chandler,"I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?"
179,Joey,"Thanks, man."
180,Joey,"And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?"
181,Chandler,Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
182,Joey,Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
183,Phoebe,"But Mon, you have to get our money!"
184,Monica,"Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying!"
185,Monica,"With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant."
186,Phoebe,"I know, it's tough."
187,Phoebe,You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?
188,Monica,What?
189,Phoebe,Pay the caterer!
190,Phoebe,"Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying."
191,Phoebe,"It's either, you know, ""that massage wasn't long enough, or, ""I don't recognize any of those songs,"" or, you know, ""these sombreros aren't big enough."
192,Phoebe,"Bad little white girl!"""
193,Monica,Okay.
194,Monica,So what do you.... you think she's faking?
195,Phoebe,"Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill."
196,Monica,"Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me."
197,Monica,Mrs.
198,Phoebe,She seems fine now.
199,Phoebe,Mrs.
200,Joey,"So, you just left?"
201,Joey,Her place was really that bad?
202,Ross,You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
203,Joey,Yeah.
204,Ross,"Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage."
205,Ross,"And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage."
206,Ross,"And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived!"
207,Ross,Here.
208,Joey,Wow.
209,Joey,Thanks.
210,Joey,"So, uh, what happened?"
211,Ross,What do you mean?
212,Ross,Nothing happened!
213,Ross,I had to get out of there.
214,Joey,"All right, so... next time, you take her to your place."
215,Ross,"No, I tried that."
216,Ross,She says it has a weird smell.
217,Joey,What kind of smell?
218,Ross,I don't know.
219,Ross,Soap?
220,Joey,"All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?"
221,Ross,Yeah.
222,Joey,"You wanna see her again, right?"
223,Ross,Yeah.
224,Joey,So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!
225,Ross,"Yeah, okay you're right."
226,Joey,Yeah.
227,Ross,"I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?"
228,Joey,Yeah!
229,Ross,"It's, uh... it's endearing, really."
230,Joey,All right!
231,Joey,Now you go get that beautiful pig!
232,Joey,Oink!
233,Chandler,"Okay, all right."
234,Chandler,I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
235,Rachel,Any luck?
236,Chandler,"Oh, yeah."
237,Chandler,"Yeah, I found this great place called ""Invisible things for Kathy."""
238,Chandler,Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
239,Rachel,"All right, look."
240,Rachel,"Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that."
241,Rachel,Like... a regular pen.
242,Chandler,"She's really going to love this, you know?"
243,Chandler,"The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her."
244,Rachel,"Aw, honey, that's so sweet."
245,Chandler,Yeah?
246,Chandler,You don't think it's just pathetic?
247,Rachel,Oh!
248,Rachel,Pathetic!
249,Joey,Hey!
250,Joey,I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes!
251,Joey,I've been looking all over for you!
252,Chandler,Where?
253,Joey,"Our place, the hall!"
254,Joey,I...
255,Chandler,I got something for her.
256,Chandler,It's a book!
257,Joey,A book?
258,Joey,Is it like a book that's also a safe?
259,Chandler,"No, it's a book that's just a book, okay?"
260,Chandler,It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit.
261,Chandler,It was her favorite book as a kid.
262,Chandler,"So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?"
263,Joey,You got it.
264,Joey,Thanks man.
265,Joey,"Thanks for doing this, I owe you one."
266,Joey,"Oh, hey!"
267,Joey,"There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?"
268,Chandler,"No, it came out to an even twenty."
269,Joey,Wow.
270,Joey,That's almost as much as a new book.
271,Phoebe,"You didn't get the money, did you?"
272,Monica,Maybe I can try at intermission?
273,Monica,"Phoebe, come on... you know what?"
274,Monica,Let's just go!
275,Phoebe,No!
276,Phoebe,"Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid!"
277,Phoebe,I don't know who she thinks she is!
278,Phoebe,Enough is enough!
279,Phoebe,"Hey, widow?"
280,Phoebe,Mrs.
281,Phoebe,"Okay, Widow!"
282,Phoebe,Mrs.
283,Phoebe,Excuse me.
284,Phoebe,Excuse me!
285,Phoebe,Thanks.
286,Phoebe,"Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you."
287,Phoebe,"Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny."
288,Phoebe,"'Cause you know what, lady?"
289,Phoebe,"We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go."
290,Phoebe,Mrs.
291,Phoebe,Good.
292,Monica,I'm gonna leave some cards here.
293,Monica,Please think of us for you next event.
294,Ross,Yes.
295,Ross,Yes I do.
296,Ross,Department of Sanitation?
297,Ross,Oh!
298,Ross,Ah.
299,Ross,Aw!
300,Ross,"Ah, Cheryl!"
301,Ross,Oh my god!
302,Ross,"I'm so sorry, Cheryl."
303,Ross,I must have freaked out.
304,Rachel,I did it!
305,Rachel,Oh!
306,Rachel,I finished it!
307,Rachel,I did it all by myself!
308,Rachel,And there's nobody to hug!
309,Rachel,Hey!
310,Rachel,"Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself!"
311,Rachel,Hug me!
312,Phoebe,Uh... yay!
313,Rachel,Thanks!
314,Monica,"Oh, that's great!"
315,Monica,Congratulations!
316,Rachel,Thank you!
317,Rachel,"Hey, how'd the catering go?"
318,Monica,"Oh, it was great!"
319,Monica,"The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did."
320,Phoebe,Yeah.
321,Phoebe,I'm a hard ass.
322,Monica,And I'm a wuss.
323,Monica,And we should be partners.
324,Phoebe,Yeah.
325,Phoebe,Hard Ass and Wuss.
326,Phoebe,We could fight crime!
327,Monica,"Wait a minute, Phoebe!"
328,Monica,We should be partners.
329,Monica,We should be catering partners.
330,Monica,"I mean, think about it!"
331,Monica,"You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!"
332,Phoebe,Okay!
333,Monica,I can cook and you can take care of the money.
334,Phoebe,Yeah.
335,Phoebe,Oh!
336,Phoebe,It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!
337,Joey,Hey!
338,Chandler,"Hey, how'd it go?"
339,Chandler,How'd she like the gift?
340,Joey,"Oh, man, she loved it!"
341,Joey,She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.
342,Chandler,Oh yeah?
343,Chandler,That's great!
344,Joey,"Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!"
345,Chandler,Aahhuuhhh....
346,Joey,Hey!
347,Chandler,Hey!
348,Chandler,Happy birthday.
349,Joey,"You know, uh...  Chandler got you a gift, too."
350,Chandler,No he didn't.
351,Joey,"Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter!"
352,Joey,Ha-ho-ho!
353,Chandler,Happy birthday!
354,Chandler,I'm sorry.
355,Chandler,"See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock."
356,Chandler,"Oh, yeah... yeah."
357,Joey,Ah.
358,Joey,Hm.
359,Joey,Wanna go to bed?
360,Joey,"Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon."
361,Chandler,Goodnight.
362,Chandler,"Oh, uh, yeah..."
363,Chandler,"I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time."
364,Chandler,"Uh, the book?"
365,Chandler,What do you mean?
366,Chandler,Uhl..ell.
367,Chandler,"By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, ""Uhl, ell."""
368,Chandler,"Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend."
369,Chandler,Goodnight.
370,Joey,"Hey, that coupon expires, you know."
371,Joey,Closing Credits
372,Monica,Hi.
373,Monica,"Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister."
374,Monica,Yeah.
375,Monica,"Anyway, he told me about your apartment."
376,Monica,"And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it."
377,Monica,"So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?"
378,Monica,No?
379,Monica,End
0,Rachel,That is it!
1,Rachel,"You just barge in here, you don't knock"
2,Chandler,I'm sorry!
3,Rachel,You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
4,Chandler,"Rachel, wait, wait."
5,Rachel,"No, you wait!"
6,Rachel,This is ridiculous!
7,Chandler,Can I just say one thing?
8,Rachel,What?
9,Rachel,What?
10,Chandler,That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
11,Rachel,Oh!!
12,Rachel,Opening Credits
13,Phoebe,"Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things."
14,Phoebe,Y'know?
15,Phoebe,"Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower."
16,Phoebe,Oops!
17,Phoebe,Thanks.
18,Phoebe,"Okay, now go away so we can talk about you."
19,Phoebe,Isn't he great?
20,Rachel,He's so cute!
21,Rachel,And he seems to like you so much.
22,Phoebe,"I know, I know."
23,Phoebe,So sweet... and so complicated.
24,Phoebe,"And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?"
25,Monica,"So, you think you'll do it on his couch?"
26,Phoebe,"Oh, I don't know, I don't know."
27,Phoebe,"I think that's a little weird, y'know?"
28,Phoebe,Vinyl.
29,Rachel,Okaaay.
30,Rachel,Any of you guys want anything else?
31,Chandler,"Oh, yes, could I have one of those."
32,Rachel,"No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those."
33,Rachel,Anybody else?
34,Chandler,Okay.
35,Chandler,"No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies."
36,Ross,You what?
37,Ross,Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
38,Chandler,It was an accident.
39,Chandler,Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
40,Rachel,"Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?"
41,Phoebe,"Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts."
42,Rachel,"Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change."
43,Chandler,"Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies."
44,Rachel,Nice?
45,Rachel,They were nice.
46,Rachel,"I mean, that's it?"
47,Rachel,"I mean, mittens are nice."
48,Chandler,"Okaaay,  rock, hard place, me."
49,Chandler,"Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky."
50,Chandler,What'd you mean by that?
51,Chandler,Huh.
52,Chandler,"Uhhuh, how did you know that?"
53,Joey,Hey you guys.
54,Joey,"Hey, you all know my dad, right?"
55,Monica,"Hey, how long are you in the city?"
56,Monica,Mr.
57,Phoebe,"Oh, this is my friend Roger."
58,Joey,"Dad, dad."
59,Joey,Mr.
60,Joey,Hey Ma.
61,Joey,"Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and..."
62,Joey,Excuse me?
63,Joey,Did you know this isn't Ma?
64,Joey,Mr.
65,Joey,Sure.
66,Joey,So how long you been...  Mr.
67,Joey,Since then?!
68,Joey,Mr.
69,Joey,...I d'know.
70,Joey,Mr.
71,Joey,You're one to talk.
72,Joey,Mr.
73,Joey,Oh man.
74,Joey,Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
75,Joey,Mr.
76,Joey,It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life.
77,Joey,"He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A."
78,Joey,That'd be cool....
79,Joey,This blows!
80,Rachel,"I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents?"
81,Rachel,Why do they have to become people?
82,Rachel,Why do they have...  Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
83,Chandler,What?
84,Chandler,What?
85,Rachel,Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
86,Ross,"Alright, alright."
87,Ross,"We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this."
88,Ross,"Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee."
89,Chandler,"Y'know, I don't see that happening?"
90,Rachel,"C'mon, he's right."
91,Rachel,Tit for tat.
92,Chandler,Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
93,Monica,Hello?
94,Phoebe,It's Phoebe.
95,Monica,C'mon up.
96,Chandler,"Oh, good."
97,Chandler,Rog is here.
98,Joey,What's the matter with Rog?
99,Ross,Yeah.
100,Chandler,"Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing..."
101,Chandler,I hate that guy.
102,Ross,"What, so he was a little analytical."
103,Ross,"That's what he does, y'know?"
104,Ross,"C'mon, he's not that bad."
105,Ross,"Y'see, that's where you're wrong."
106,Ross,Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
107,Ross,Why?
108,Ross,Why would I why?
109,Ross,Why?
110,Ross,Why?
111,Ross,Why?
112,Monica,"Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing."
113,Ross,That that's ridiculous!
114,Ross,I don't feel guilty for her failures!
115,Monica,Oh!
116,Monica,So you think I'm a failure!
117,Phoebe,Isn't he good?
118,Ross,"Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying..."
119,Monica,"Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side."
120,Monica,But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
121,Ross,"Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!"
122,Rachel,You're right!
123,Rachel,I mean you're right!
124,Rachel,"It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship."
125,Rachel,"Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in."
126,Phoebe,"Oh, okay."
127,Phoebe,"Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?"
128,Phoebe,"Oh, okay."
129,Phoebe,"Listen, thanks for everything, Mon."
130,Monica,You're welcome.
131,Monica,Hate that guy!
132,Joey,"Night, you guys."
133,Chandler,"Oh look, it's the woman we ordered."
134,Joey,Hey.
135,Joey,"Can, uh, can we help you?"
136,Joey,I'm Joey Tribbiani.
137,Chandler,"Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?"
138,Chandler,Commercial Break
139,Chandler,"Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys."
140,Joey,"Dad, Ronni's here."
141,Joey,Mr.
142,Chandler,"So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?"
143,Joey,Who-ah-ho.
144,Joey,Mr.
145,Joey,No you won't.
146,Joey,If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff.
147,Joey,I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
148,Joey,Mr.
149,Joey,"That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules."
150,Joey,And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
151,Joey,"Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room."
152,Chandler,"C'mon, I'll show you to my room."
153,Chandler,"...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by ""No thanks, it's late."""
154,Joey,Okay.
155,Joey,Now this is just for tonight.
156,Joey,"Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change."
157,Joey,This has gone on long enough.
158,Joey,Mr.
159,Joey,"Well, either you break it off with Ronni Mr."
160,Joey,Then you gotta come clean with Ma!
161,Joey,This is not right!
162,Joey,Mr.
163,Joey,I don't wanna hear it!
164,Joey,Now go to my room!
165,Chandler,"Hey, Kicky."
166,Chandler,What're you doing?
167,Joey,Just trying to get comfortable.
168,Joey,I can't sleep in my underwear.
169,Chandler,"Well, you're gonna."
170,Joey,I've been thinking.
171,Joey,"Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls..."
172,Chandler,"Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?"
173,Joey,"Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women."
174,Joey,"And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know?"
175,Joey,"Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking..."
176,Chandler,"Hey, you're not him."
177,Chandler,You're you.
178,Chandler,"When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?"
179,Joey,No.
180,Chandler,No.
181,Chandler,You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business.
182,Chandler,"Now that wasn't easy, but you did it!"
183,Chandler,"And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say ""No thanks, I'm married."""
184,Joey,You really think so?
185,Chandler,Yeah.
186,Chandler,I really do.
187,Joey,"Thanks, Chandler."
188,Chandler,Get off!
189,Monica,Hi...May I help you?
190,Monica,Okay...who are you?
191,Monica,"Oh, c'mon in."
192,Rachel,"Hi, I'm Rachel."
193,Rachel,Bathroom's up there.
194,Rachel,"Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?"
195,Rachel,Perfect.
196,Rachel,"Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time."
197,Rachel,"Hey, Mr. Trib."
198,Rachel,Mr.
199,Rachel,Chandler Bing?
200,Rachel,It's time to see your thing.
201,Joey,What's the matter with you?
202,Rachel,I thought it was Chandler!
203,Chandler,What?
204,Chandler,What?
205,Rachel,You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
206,Chandler,"Sorry, my my thing was in there with me."
207,Phoebe,Hey.
208,Monica,How's it going?
209,Phoebe,Good.
210,Phoebe,Oh oh!
211,Phoebe,Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
212,Phoebe,So what's going on?
213,Monica,"Nothing, um, it's just, um..."
214,Monica,It's Roger.
215,Ross,"I dunno, there's just something about..."
216,Chandler,Basically we just feel that he's...
217,Rachel,We hate that guy.
218,Ross,"We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry."
219,Phoebe,Uh-huh.
220,Phoebe,Okay.
221,Phoebe,"Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?"
222,Rachel,We're sorry.
223,Joey,Ma!
224,Joey,What're you doing here?
225,Joey,Mrs.
226,Joey,Oww!
227,Joey,Big ring!
228,Joey,Mrs.
229,Joey,"Hold on, you-you knew?"
230,Joey,Mrs.
231,Joey,"So then how could you I mean, how could you?!"
232,Joey,Mrs.
233,Joey,"Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?!"
234,Joey,"I mean, what about you?"
235,Joey,Mrs.
236,Joey,I'm...happy...for you?
237,Joey,Mrs.
238,Joey,"Ma, I'm sorry."
239,Joey,I just did what I thought you'd want.
240,Joey,Mrs.
241,Joey,Yeah.
242,Joey,You're ten times prettier than she is.
243,Joey,Mrs.
244,Joey,With this ring?
245,Joey,No contest.
246,Phoebe,"Nothing, nothing."
247,Phoebe,"It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine."
248,Phoebe,It's my friends.
249,Phoebe,They-they have a liking problem with you.
250,Phoebe,"In that, um, they don't."
251,Phoebe,But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see.
252,Phoebe,They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff.
253,Phoebe,They just think you're a little...
254,Phoebe,Intense and creepy.
255,Phoebe,But I don't.
256,Phoebe,"Me, Phoebe."
257,Phoebe,You're not?
258,Phoebe,"See, that's why you're so great!"
259,Monica,"So you talked to your dad, huh."
260,Joey,Yeah.
261,Joey,"He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today."
262,Rachel,Wow.
263,Chandler,Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
264,Ross,"So Joey, you okay?"
265,Joey,"Yeah, I guess."
266,Joey,"It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go."
267,Joey,"Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes."
268,Rachel,"Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them."
269,Chandler,"If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or..."
270,Chandler,I'll end up like my mom.
271,Phoebe,Hey.
272,Monica,How's it going?
273,Phoebe,"Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger."
274,Phoebe,"Yeah, right."
275,Rachel,What happened?
276,Phoebe,"I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just..."
277,Phoebe,I hate that guy!
278,Phoebe,Closing Credits
279,Phoebe,"Hey, Joey."
280,Phoebe,What's going on?

3,Chandler,Necklace?
4,Chandler,Dress?
5,Chandler,Boots?
6,Chandler,Boots!
7,Monica,Yes!
8,Monica,"Now, they're a little more than I normally spend on bootsor rent"
9,Chandler,Oh my God!
10,Monica,I know.
11,Chandler,I'm gonna miss being able to afford food.
12,Monica,"I'm sorry, they just, they just look so good!"
13,Monica,"And the saleswoman was looking at me like, ""Oh, these are way too expensive for you."""
14,Chandler,She had a point.
15,Rachel,Hi!
16,Monica,Hey.
17,Rachel,Oh my God!
18,Rachel,Oh Monica!
19,Rachel,Those boots are amazing!
20,Monica,They're mine!
21,Chandler,"Yeah well, too bad we're gonna have to return them."
22,Rachel,Return them?!
23,Rachel,Shh!
24,Rachel,They're gonna hear you!
25,Monica,"Honey, I'm not returning them."
26,Monica,Okay?
27,Monica,"I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but I'm going to wear them all the time."
28,Monica,You'll see.
29,Monica,"Besides, I love the compliments."
30,Monica,"I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?"
31,Chandler,I have you.
32,Monica,Nice try; I'm keeping the boots.
33,Monica,Opening Credits
34,Ross,"That's right, I love you!"
35,Ross,And-and I'm gonna play with you all the time.
36,Phoebe,How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
37,Rachel,He's talking to the baby.
38,Phoebe,Ohh!
39,Phoebe,Okay!
40,Phoebe,"Okay, cause when-when he said, ""I can't wait to hear your first words,"" I thought, ""There's a trick."""
41,Rachel,Okay.
42,Rachel,"Well, I gotta go you guys."
43,Rachel,I'll see you later.
44,Phoebe,Okay.
45,Ross,Bye.
46,Rachel,Bye.
47,Joey,"Oh hey Rach, listenHi!"
48,Rachel,Hi.
49,Joey,"Umm, can you do me a favor?"
50,Joey,I was talkin' to my sister and she knows you work at Ralph Lauren
51,Rachel,"No, forget it!"
52,Rachel,No way!
53,Rachel,I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison.
54,Rachel,It is a waste.
55,Joey,"No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her."
56,Joey,"My youngest sister, Dina, she's really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, y'know, to give her some advice."
57,Rachel,I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors
58,Joey,"Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!"
59,Rachel,Really?!
60,Rachel,Oh my God!
61,Rachel,I'm successful!
62,Joey,"Okay, so will you meet with her?"
63,Rachel,Yes!
64,Rachel,I'd love to!
65,Rachel,Have her come by the office.
66,Joey,Great!
67,Joey,Thanks!
68,Joey,You're gonna love her so much.
69,Joey,"AndOh, she's the smartest of all the Tribbiani children."
70,Joey,"Hey, y'know the S.A.T's?"
71,Rachel,Yeah.
72,Joey,She took em!
73,Phoebe,Hey Ross!
74,Phoebe,Doesn't Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?
75,Ross,Yeah.
76,Ross,Why?
77,Phoebe,Sting has a son that goes there too!
78,Ross,Yeah I know; he's in Ben's class.
79,Phoebe,You knew this and you never said anything?!
80,Phoebe,With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?
81,Ross,Fine!
82,Ross,No more dinosaur stuff!
83,Ross,Can I talk about fossils?
84,Phoebe,"Sting's son, seven years old and there's a picture."
85,Ross,What are you reading?
86,Ross,The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?
87,Phoebe,"No, it's New York magazine."
88,Phoebe,It's an article about the best schools in the city.
89,Phoebe,So how well do you know Sting?
90,Ross,"Uh, I actually haven't even met him."
91,Phoebe,"Uh-huh, yeah that's too bad."
92,Phoebe,"I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but it's totally sold out."
93,Phoebe,I know!
94,Phoebe,Why don't you meet him and get tickets?!
95,Phoebe,If you get two I'll take you.
96,Ross,"Well actually, I'm picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he'll be there."
97,Phoebe,There you go!
98,Phoebe,"Oh, you are so lucky!"
99,Phoebe,You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow!
100,Phoebe,That's why you have kids!
101,Monica,Hey guys!
102,Chandler,Hey-hey.
103,Rachel,Hi Monica!
104,Monica,Hey.
105,Rachel,Hi boots.
106,Monica,See Chandler?
107,Monica,I'm getting a lot of use out of them already!
108,Monica,They're very practical.
109,Monica,"See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants"
110,Chandler,You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them.
111,Phoebe,Wow!
112,Phoebe,They're beautiful!
113,Rachel,Ahh
114,Monica,They hurt so much!
115,Phoebe,What?
116,Monica,The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!
117,Rachel,Well-well you can give them to me!
118,Rachel,I haven't felt my feet in years!
119,Monica,I can't!
120,Monica,"I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that I'd wear them all the time, I just can't give them away!"
121,Phoebe,Well then get your money back and return them!
122,Monica,I can't do that either!
123,Monica,The soles' are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.
124,Ross,Hey!
125,Chandler,Hey!
126,Ross,Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school
127,Chandler,I don't think you did a very thorough job!
128,Ross,I dropped him off at Carol's.
129,Ross,"Anyway, it turns out that I'm not going to be able to get those tickets though."
130,Phoebe,Oh no!
131,Phoebe,Why not?
132,Ross,Well it turns out that Ben and Sting's son do not get along.
133,Phoebe,How come?
134,Ross,"Apparently, Sting's son made fun of the fact that Ben's moms are lesbinims."
135,Phoebe,Wait!
136,Phoebe,But Ross if they don't get along then you should smooth things over.
137,Phoebe,Make them be friends.
138,Ross,"Phoebe, you can't force kids to be friends."
139,Phoebe,Sure you can!
140,Phoebe,"Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!"
141,Ross,Playpen?!
142,Ross,Ben's seven!
143,Phoebe,Your kid is seven?!
144,Phoebe,He's really small.
145,Phoebe,Please!
146,Phoebe,Please get the tickets!
147,Ross,"Look I'm sorry Pheebs, I can't do it."
148,Phoebe,Yes you can!
149,Phoebe,Sting says so himself!
150,Ross,What?
151,Phoebe,Rosssss can!
152,Ross,"Look Phoebe, I'm sorry it's just"
153,Phoebe,Rossss can!
154,Ross,"Phoebe, I"

165,Joey,This is so exciting for her.
166,Joey,"Well, I'll let you two fashists get down to business."
167,Rachel,Okay.
168,Rachel,"All right Dina, well let's talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in."
169,Rachel,"Let's see, there's design, but you may need a whole other degree for that."
170,Rachel,"Uh, there's-there's sales, which is great because you get to travel"
171,Rachel,And there's marketing
172,Monica,Ahhhhhhhh!
173,Chandler,What's wrong?
174,Monica,Oh nothing I'm justjust was yawning.
175,Chandler,"Oh don't forget, my office holiday party is tonight."
176,Monica,"Honey, we don't really have to go to this thing tonight do we?"
177,Chandler,"Now sweetie, I know you don't like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots."
178,Chandler,See?
179,Chandler,Every cloud has asupple leather lining.
180,Monica,I-I don't-I don't think that I'm gonna wear the boots tonight.
181,Chandler,Why not?
182,Monica,"Well y'know, I'm just-I'm just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money."
183,Monica,Or!
184,Monica,Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!
185,Chandler,Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
186,Monica,"Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots don't really go with it."
187,Chandler,"You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!"
188,Monica,Fine!
189,Monica,"If you want me to wear the boots, I'll wear the boots."
190,Monica,"In fact, I'll go into my room right now and y'know try the outfit on."
191,Chandler,Okay.
192,Monica,Okay?
193,Monica,Ooo wee!
194,Monica,Christmas party in my boots!
195,Rachel,"Honey, it's going to be okay."
196,Rachel,"He's been incredibly supportive of me, and if he gets a little upset; that's what the meatball sub is for."
197,Rachel,Okay.
198,Joey,Hey!
199,Joey,It's my fashion girls!
200,Joey,What's wrong?
201,Rachel,"Honey, why don't you sit down?"
202,Rachel,Dina has something that she wants to tell you.
203,Joey,Oh.
204,Joey,"What's, what's going on?"
205,Joey,Is it mom?
206,Joey,Is she sick?
207,Joey,Is it dad's heart?
208,Joey,Is that a sandwich?
209,Joey,Is that a sandwich?
210,Rachel,Joeythere's something that youshould know.
211,Rachel,Dina?
212,Joey,What?
213,Rachel,Now!
214,Rachel,Give him the sandwich!
215,Rachel,Give him the sandwich!
216,Joey,Well obviously this is a mistake!
217,Joey,You can't be pregnant!
218,Joey,Because you have to have sex to get pregnant!
219,Rachel,What?!
220,Rachel,Dina
221,Joey,Bub!!!
222,Joey,I can't believe this!
223,Joey,You're the good one!
224,Joey,You went to college!
225,Joey,Both years!
226,Joey,Who did this to you?
227,Joey,You got pregnant for funny?!
228,Joey,Dinaif he's funnylaugh!
229,Joey,"All right, I'll be back in a little while!"
230,Joey,You stay here!
231,Joey,I can't look at you right now!
232,Rachel,I know.
233,Rachel,Commercial Break
234,Phoebe,"Oh, there you are Ben!"
235,Phoebe,"Well, I heard you're having a problem with one of the boys in your class."
236,Phoebe,"And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay."
237,Phoebe,"Now umm, the boy's name is Sting's son."
238,Phoebe,"Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers."
239,Phoebe,Him you're friends with.
240,Phoebe,The
241,Phoebe,Yes!
242,Phoebe,"Yes you can, I'm looking for Jack's parents."
243,Phoebe,The
244,Phoebe,"Uh-huh, I'm with Ben."
245,Phoebe,The
246,Phoebe,I am one of Ben's mothers.
247,Phoebe,I'm a lesbian.

249,Phoebe,The
250,Phoebe,Oh.
251,Phoebe,The
252,Phoebe,Ah!
253,Phoebe,Okay so that would make me Susan.
254,Phoebe,The
255,Phoebe,Yeah!
256,Phoebe,Let's do that!!
257,Phoebe,That-that sounds good.
258,Phoebe,"We should sit down and talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings."
259,Phoebe,"Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?"
260,Phoebe,The
261,Phoebe,Uh-huh.
262,Phoebe,Uh-huh.
263,Phoebe,"Umm, could-could I get a copy of that?"
264,Phoebe,"Cause Carol threw it out, she lost ours."
265,Phoebe,"She's such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass."
266,Chandler,"Y'know, that party wasn't bad."
267,Monica,Yeah!
268,Monica,I didn't know there would be dancing.
269,Monica,That was a fun surprise!
270,Chandler,"I don't see any uh, cabs."
271,Chandler,Maybe we should just walk?
272,Monica,"Oh no, we can't walk!"
273,Chandler,"What honey, it's like fifteen blocks to the subway."
274,Chandler,Let's go.
275,Monica,Hey!
276,Monica,Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?
277,Chandler,What's going on?
278,Monica,I can't walk.
279,Monica,Okay?
280,Monica,Okay?
281,Monica,These boots were a huge mistake!
282,Chandler,What?
283,Monica,Okay you were right!
284,Monica,"All right, I never should have bought them!"
285,Monica,They're killing me!
286,Monica,One toe at a time!
287,Chandler,So I was right.
288,Chandler,This is what it feels like to be right.
289,Chandler,It's oddly unsettling.
290,Monica,How are we gonna get home?
291,Monica,Maybe a piggy-back ride?
292,Chandler,Hop on.
293,Monica,Okay.
294,Monica,"Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first."
295,Monica,AhOohOohhOhhOh GodOhhOhOhhOhhhh
296,Chandler,"Honey, I know you're in pain right now, but I'm a little turned on."
297,Rachel,What college was that Dina?
298,Rachel,"Joey, what are you doing?"
299,Joey,Just what needs to be done!
300,Joey,"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman"
301,Rachel,Oh Joey this is crazy!
302,Joey,Don't interrupt me when I'm talkin' to God!
303,Joey,Now where were we?
304,Joey,"Oh right, okay."
305,Joey,"Do you Dina, take this man"
306,Joey,Oh you'll take em!
307,Joey,Hey!
308,Joey,You don't get a say in this!
309,Joey,Ahhh!
310,Joey,"I heard ""I do"", we're halfway there!"
311,Joey,Okay!
312,Joey,You!
313,Rachel,All right Joey!
314,Rachel,That is enough!
315,Rachel,"Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it's not legal."
316,Rachel,Okay?
317,Rachel,"They-they don't have a marriage license, they don't have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe!"
318,Joey,Well what am I supposed to do?
319,Rachel,You're supposed to realize that they are adults!
320,Rachel,And that they can make their own decisions.
321,Joey,No they can't!
322,Joey,They were stupid enough to get knocked up!
323,Rachel,Heyyyyy!
324,Rachel,Contraceptives are not always effective!
325,Rachel,Right?
326,Rachel,"Oh, come on kids!"
327,Rachel,A little help here!
328,Phoebe,Wow!
329,Phoebe,This place is incredible!

347,Phoebe,Uh-hmm.
348,Phoebe,Okay.
349,Phoebe,"Well then, could we reschedule?"
350,Phoebe,"For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 o'clock?"
351,Phoebe,Trudie
352,Phoebe,Concert.
353,Phoebe,Yeah.
354,Phoebe,That does put us inquite a pickle.
355,Phoebe,"Because you see I'm very busy before and after the concert, and he's obviously busy during."
356,Phoebe,Trudie
357,Phoebe,Unless!
358,Phoebe,"Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course."
359,Phoebe,Trudie
360,Phoebe,"Oh, thank you."
361,Phoebe,Four would be great.
362,Phoebe,Trudie

376,Chandler,Oh I'm sorry!
377,Chandler,Do you need a break?
378,Monica,My boots in tan!
379,Monica,Hey!
380,Monica,Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
381,Chandler,I can see it from right here.
382,Chandler,It'll cost you one husband.
383,Monica,"Okay, I'm sorry."
384,Monica,I think I can walk the rest of the way now.
385,Monica,Just-just give me my boots.
386,Chandler,I don't have your boots.
387,Monica,Well I don't have them either.
388,Monica,Where are they?
389,Chandler,"Well, why don't you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!"
390,Monica,Okay.
391,Monica,"God well, we gotta go back and get them!"
392,Chandler,"Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?"
393,Monica,"Okay, I'm never gonna wear them again."
394,Monica,I just didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
395,Chandler,Y'know what?
396,Chandler,You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
397,Monica,Okay.
398,Monica,All right.
399,Chandler,Okay.
400,Monica,Bye bootsWait!
401,Monica,Half off?
402,Rachel,"Joey, just because they're not getting married doesn't mean this is going to be a disaster."
403,Rachel,Maybe they have a plan!
404,Joey,Oh?
405,Joey,Oh!
406,Joey,Okay!
407,Joey,Okay!
408,Joey,Let's hear their plan!
409,Joey,"Now, what's the future look like for Dina and Bobby?"
410,Joey,You were right.
411,Joey,He is funny.
412,Rachel,"Hey, now wait a minute!"
413,Rachel,I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you!
414,Rachel,"Now come on Bobby, why don't you tell us a little bit about your band?"
415,Rachel,Really?
416,Joey,"Dina, if you're having a baby you should be married!"
417,Joey,Even if it is to Bobby!
418,Joey,"Dude, that's not a compliment!"
419,Joey,So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
420,Joey,What are you gonna do?
421,Joey,You're gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourselfwithout a husband?!
422,Joey,You can't be a single mother alone!
423,Joey,You're gonna ruin your life!
424,Rachel,Oh excuse me!
425,Rachel,Am I ruining my life?
426,Joey,No!
427,Joey,No!
428,Joey,No!
429,Joey,It's different for you.
430,Joey,You're so strong and together.
431,Joey,You're not some dumb kid who doesn't know what she's doing.
432,Joey,"One pregnant woman at a time, please!"
433,Joey,I just want you to be okay.
434,Rachel,So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
435,Joey,Maybe!
436,Joey,Well!
437,Joey,"Wellso-so uh, what kind of music does Numb NutsOh forget it!"
438,Joey,I can't!
439,Joey,Because!
440,Joey,Cause Cause you're my baby sister!
441,Joey,"Well I'd be scared of them, but all right."
442,Joey,Of course he's gonna have his Uncle Joey!
443,Joey,That's right!
444,Joey,By his uncle too!
445,Rachel,"Okay Bobby, why don't we just come over here and let them have a little moment."
446,Joey,Come here!
447,Rachel,No!
448,Rachel,Seriously!
449,Rachel,What's wrong with you?!
450,Rachel,Closing Credits
451,Ross,You're gonna love me so much.
452,Ross,I got Sting tickets!

456,Ross,Welllet's just say  Rosss caaaaan!
457,Phoebe,"Oo, where are the seats?"
458,Ross,"Uh, middle balcony."
459,Phoebe,"Okay, now would you say that that's more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife, or a member of his family?"
460,Ross,Yeah.
461,Phoebe,Then that's not breaking the law!
462,Phoebe,I'm there!
463,Phoebe,End
0,Ross,Hey!
1,Ross,"Chandler, Joey, and"
2,Phoebe,Hey!
3,Ross,"I'm sorry I'm late, did I miss anything?"
4,Phoebe,Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth.
5,Ross,15?
6,Ross,Your personal best!
7,Phoebe,Where were you?
8,Ross,"Oh, on a date."
9,Ross,"Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate."
10,Chandler,"Oh, yeah!"
11,Chandler,How did you meet her?
12,Phoebe,"Oh, which museum?"
13,Phoebe,"No, answer his."
14,Ross,"Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars."
15,Ross,She was totally at my mercy.
16,Chandler,Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
17,Ross,"No, I'm getting back down cause she lives in Poughkeepsie."
18,Ross,"She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away."
19,Chandler,How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie?
20,Chandler,That joke would've killed in Albany.
21,Joey,Done!
22,Joey,I did it!
23,Joey,"Heh, who's stupid now?"
24,Joey,Opening Credits
25,Chandler,"Hey, look at this!"
26,Chandler,They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
27,Phoebe,"Umm, that paper's two weeks old."
28,Chandler,"All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?!"
29,Chandler,"I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can't believe I missed it."
30,Rachel,"Hey, y'know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with!"
31,Rachel,I hate being alone this time of year!
32,Rachel,"Next thing you know it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then bang!before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again."
33,Rachel,"Ohh, I want somebody!"
34,Rachel,"Y'know, I want a man!!"
35,Rachel,"I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship, y'know, just like a fling would be great."
36,Chandler,Really?!
37,Chandler,I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
38,Rachel,"Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung."
39,Joey,"Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas."
40,Chandler,Y'know what?
41,Chandler,"There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?"
42,Rachel,Yeah!
43,Rachel,"Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single."
44,Rachel,How come you never offered this before?
45,Chandler,"Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy."
46,Chandler,"So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy."
47,Rachel,Okay!
48,Rachel,No accountants.
49,Rachel,"Oh, and no one from like legal."
50,Rachel,I don't like guys with boring jobs.
51,Chandler,Oh and Ross was like what?
52,Chandler,A lion tamer?
53,Phoebe,What's wrong Mon?
54,Monica,"Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me."
55,Phoebe,Oh.
56,Monica,"I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this  on my chef's hat."
57,Phoebe,"Hey, maybe they meant to write, Quiet, bitch.'"
58,Rachel,"Hey, honey!"
59,Rachel,What's the matter?
60,Rachel,"Fine, I was just trying to be nice!"
61,Rachel,Whoa!
62,Monica,I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
63,Joey,Ohhh!
64,Monica,"I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would."
65,Monica,But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
66,Rachel,"Well, wait a minute, you're the boss!"
67,Rachel,Why don't you just yell at them?
68,Rachel,"Or, fire them?"
69,Monica,"I would love too, but I can't!"
70,Monica,"I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation."
71,Chandler,"Hey, you know what you can do?"
72,Chandler,"I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody."
73,Chandler,"Then they would all know, who's boss."
74,Joey,"Hey, Mon!"
75,Joey,"I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?"
76,Monica,That's a good idea!
77,Monica,"Wait, do you know how to waiter?"
78,Joey,Good enough to get fired.
79,Monica,"All right, you're hired!"
80,Joey,Hey!
81,Joey,That must be why I got fired last week!
82,Joey,Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
83,Chandler,Yes.
84,Chandler,"I say, Drew!"
85,Chandler,Are you seeing anybody right now?
86,Chandler,"Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm I mean No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out."
87,Chandler,I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!
88,Chandler,"See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up."
89,Chandler,"Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel."
90,Chandler,"Oh, by the way, that is her full name."
91,Chandler,"Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!"
92,Chandler,"Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!"
93,Phoebe,Hey!
94,Phoebe,"You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone."
95,Phoebe,Do you want to hear it?
96,Phoebe,"Monica, Rachel, and"
97,Joey,Yes!
98,Phoebe,"Happy Chanukah, Monica!"
99,Phoebe,"May your Christmas be snowy, Joey!"
100,Phoebe,"Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross."
101,Phoebe,"Spin the draddle, Rachel!"
102,Rachel,"Pheebs, that's great!"
103,Phoebe,"Oh, yay!"
104,Rachel,"But y'know umm, Rachel doesn't rhyme with draddle."
105,Phoebe,I know but it's so hard!
106,Phoebe,Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
107,Joey,What are you talking about?
108,Joey,Lots of things rhyme with Rachel.
109,Joey,Bagel.
110,Joey,Mail.
111,Joey,Jail.
112,Joey,Bail.
113,Joey,Able.
114,Joey,May-pole.
115,Phoebe,"All good, thanks."
116,Phoebe,Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
117,Monica,Didn't your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
118,Rachel,Oh yeah!
119,Phoebe,Pumpkin?
120,Phoebe,Yeah.
121,Phoebe,"But did he ever call you like, Budolph?"
122,Chandler,"Hello, children!"
123,Chandler,Have I got the 50 guys for you!
124,Rachel,Really?
125,Chandler,"Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me!"
126,Chandler,They're buying me drinks!
127,Chandler,They're giving me stuff!
128,Chandler,Knicks tonight?
129,Joey,Sure!
130,Joey,Where are the seats?
131,Chandler,Wherever!
132,Chandler,I've got like 20!
133,Rachel,"So, will I like any of these guys?"
134,Chandler,"Y'know what, I'm gonna uh, play the field just a little more."
135,Rachel,Chandler!
136,Chandler,Guys are signing over their 401-K's to me?
137,Phoebe,You work with robots!
138,Chandler,Yes.
139,Chandler,"Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer."
140,Rachel,"Ohh, I like swimmer's bodies!"
141,Chandler,"Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards."
142,Rachel,"Op, I like credit cards!"
143,Chandler,"See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?"
144,Rachel,"Well, so what does he do?"
145,Chandler,"Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division."
146,Rachel,Your company has a fine foods division?
147,Chandler,"It's a big company, I don'tif youI"
148,Joey,"Now, wait a second!"
149,Joey,You make food and robots?
150,Phoebe,No!
151,Phoebe,"No, the robots just work for them."
152,Monica,"All right, I'm gonna go to work."
153,Monica,Does anybody have a problem with that?
154,Joey,"Yeah, lady, I do!"
155,Joey,I got a problem with that!
156,Monica,You want a problem?
157,Monica,I'll give you a problem!
158,Joey,"Oh, what are you gonna do?"
159,Joey,You're gonna fire me?
160,Monica,"You bet your ass, I'm gonna fire you!"
161,Monica,Thank you.
162,Ross,"Oh, wow!"
163,Ross,I should get going.
164,Ross,I-I got a date tonight.
165,Chandler,Oh yeah!
166,Chandler,With who?
167,Ross,You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
168,Chandler,Yeah.
169,Ross,Not her.
170,Ross,"Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can't decide between the two of them."
171,Ross,"Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun."
172,Ross,"But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown."
173,Ross,"Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun."
174,Phoebe,"If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?"
175,Ross,"Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y'know?"
176,Ross,She lives so close.
177,Ross,"And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that wasif she was kidding was very funny."
178,Ross,"On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist."
179,Joey,Hey!
180,Ross,Hey!
181,Chandler,"Hey, man!"
182,Phoebe,Hey!
183,Phoebe,"Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?"
184,Joey,Damn!
185,Joey,Hey.
186,Monica,Hey.
187,Joey,"Hey, what happened to your fancy chef's jacket?"
188,Monica,They baked it.
189,Monica,I can't take this anymore.
190,Monica,"I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight."
191,Joey,You got it!
192,Joey,Oh-oh!
193,Monica,What are you doing?
194,Joey,It's still a tiny bit on fire there.
195,Monica,Thanks.
196,Monica,I think you got it!
197,Rachel,Chandler!!
198,Rachel,You have the best taste in men!
199,Chandler,"Well, like father, like son."
200,Rachel,Patrick and I had such a great time last night!
201,Rachel,I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
202,Chandler,Really?!
203,Chandler,I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious?
204,Chandler,I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
205,Rachel,"Well, y'know, possibly."
206,Rachel,"You didn't tell him that, though?"
207,Rachel,Right?
208,Chandler,"Ummmmmmmm, no."
209,Rachel,You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?!
210,Rachel,You don't tell the guy that!
211,Chandler,Why not?!
212,Chandler,I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to getoh I see.
213,Rachel,"Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first dateoh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea."
214,Monica,"Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?"
215,Joey,Yeah.
216,Joey,"Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey."
217,Joey,"Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname."
218,Joey,There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!
219,Joey,The
220,Monica,Okay.
221,Monica,Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials?
222,Monica,"Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bagWhy is nobody writing these down?"
223,Monica,The
224,Monica,Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
225,Monica,The
226,Monica,"Okay, forget the specials for a minute."
227,Monica,"Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm,  tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere The"
228,Monica,A positive atmosphere!
229,Monica,But I-I-I have had it up to here.
230,Monica,"From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway!"
231,Monica,All right?
232,Monica,Does anybody have a problem with that?!!
233,Monica,Hey new guy!
234,Monica,"I said, does anybody have a problem with that?"
235,Joey,No ma'am.
236,Joey,The
237,Monica,What the hell happened?
238,Joey,I am so-so-so sorry.
239,Joey,I was gonna do it!
240,Joey,Really!
241,Joey,"But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, ""Wow!"
242,Joey,"It's been a long time since I had  327 + 238 dollars!"""
243,Monica,"Joey, we had a deal."
244,Monica,That-that's why you're here!
245,Monica,I've got to fire you!
246,Joey,And I gotta pay rent!
247,Joey,"Look, how-how about this?"
248,Joey,"You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you."
249,Monica,What kinda things have you been saying?
250,Joey,"Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in."
251,Phoebe,"Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica."
252,Phoebe,Very merry
253,Chandler,"Oh, y'know, y'know what Pheebs?"
254,Phoebe,What?
255,Chandler,"I'm not Jewish, so"
256,Phoebe,So!
257,Phoebe,"Ross doesn't really decorate his tree with floss, but you don't hear him complaining do you?"
258,Phoebe,God!
259,Chandler,Bad dream?
260,Ross,I wasn't sleeping.
261,Chandler,"Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe's song about?"
262,Ross,The one with the cat.
263,Ross,"I gotta go, I've got another date."
264,Phoebe,"So, did you pick one yet?"
265,Ross,"No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke."
266,Ross,But it was a different joke than I thoughtit wasn't that funny.
267,Ross,So I'm still torn.
268,Phoebe,"Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both."
269,Phoebe,Okay?
270,Phoebe,"You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown."
271,Phoebe,"And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done!"
272,Ross,"Y'know, you're right."
273,Ross,Thank you.
274,Phoebe,"Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague."
275,Chandler,Prague?
276,Phoebe,There's sooo much you don't know.
277,Rachel,Chandler!
278,Rachel,"Patrick just uh, ended things with me."
279,Rachel,Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
280,Chandler,I did!
281,Chandler,I absolutely did!
282,Rachel,You idiot!
283,Chandler,"I'm sure you're right, but why?"
284,Rachel,You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship!
285,Rachel,You don't tell the guy that!
286,Rachel,Now you scared him away!
287,Chandler,"Oh, man."
288,Chandler,"I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry."
289,Rachel,"Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!"
290,Chandler,I know!
291,Chandler,I know!
292,Rachel,Oh!
293,Rachel,See just I'm right back where I started!
294,Rachel,"Aww, this sucks!"
295,Rachel,"Being alone, sucks!"
296,Chandler,"Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody!"
297,Chandler,You're a great catch!
298,Chandler,"Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once."
299,Rachel,Really?
300,Chandler,Yeah!
301,Chandler,"You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?"
302,Rachel,No.
303,Chandler,"Oh, it doesn't matter."
304,Chandler,"Hey, y'know what, I've got two tickets to tonight's Rangers game, you wanna come with me?"
305,Rachel,Cute guys in little shorts?
306,Rachel,Sure.
307,Chandler,"Well, actually it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth."
308,Rachel,Well that sounds fun too.
309,Chandler,Have you ever been with a woman?
310,Rachel,What?!
311,Rachel,"Chandler, what is the matter with you?"
312,Chandler,So there is no good time to ask that question.
313,Monica,I need more swordfish.
314,Monica,Can you get me some more swordfish?
315,Monica,Kitchen
316,Monica,You did a minute ago!
317,Monica,Kitchen
318,Monica,Fine!
319,Monica,Okay!
320,Monica,Very funny!
321,Monica,Somebody let me out please?!
322,Monica,"Come on, I'm cold!"
323,Monica,And covered in marinara sauce!
324,Monica,Come on!
325,Monica,Let me out!
326,Monica,The
327,Monica,That's not funny.

34,Monica,"Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?"
35,Phoebe,"Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know?"
36,Phoebe,"I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know."
37,Rachel,Does anybody want anything else?
38,Ross,"Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing."
39,Ross,"Nothing, just, just, I'm fine."
40,Phoebe,What's the matter?
41,Phoebe,Why so scrunchy?
42,Rachel,It's my father.
43,Rachel,He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
44,Ross,"That guy, he burns me up."
45,Rachel,"Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home."
46,Rachel,"Oh, it was horrible."
47,Rachel,He called me young lady.
48,Chandler,"Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that."
49,Monica,"Did he give you that whole ""You're-not-up-to-this"" thing again?"
50,Rachel,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
51,Rachel,"Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of ""You'll never make it on your own""."
52,Phoebe,"Uh-huh, uh-huh."
53,Joey,"My god, Angela."
54,Monica,"Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her."
55,Phoebe,Are you gonna go over there?
56,Joey,"No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet."
57,Joey,I don't wanna seem too eager.
58,Joey,"One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi."
59,Joey,That seems pretty cool.
60,Joey,"Hey, Angela."
61,Joey,You look good.
62,Joey,You don't say.
63,Ross,"So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?"
64,Rachel,"Oh, big glamour night."
65,Rachel,Me and Monica at Laundorama.
66,Ross,"Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence?"
67,Ross,Guess who's doing laundry there too?
68,Rachel,Who?
69,Ross,Me.
70,Ross,Was that not clear?
71,Ross,"Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?"
72,Rachel,Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
73,Ross,"Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem."
74,Ross,"Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy."
75,Ross,"Anyway, say, sevenish?"
76,Rachel,Sure.
77,Joey,Bob?
78,Joey,Who the hell's Bob?
79,Joey,"Come on, we were great together."
80,Joey,"And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too."
81,Joey,What?
82,Joey,"Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight?"
83,Joey,"You know, as friends?"
84,Joey,"You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica."
85,Joey,"Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you."
86,Monica,Forget it.
87,Monica,Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
88,Joey,Come on.
89,Joey,This guy's great.
90,Joey,His name's Bob.
91,Joey,He's Angela's... brother.
92,Joey,"He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job."
93,Joey,"Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is..."
94,Monica,"Oh, god help us."
95,Joey,What?
96,Monica,Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile.
97,Monica,Eww!
98,Joey,Eww!
99,Joey,"Look, I'm asking a favor here."
100,Joey,"If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me."
101,Monica,What's going on here?
102,Monica,You go out with tons of girls.
103,Joey,"I know, but, I made a huge mistake."
104,Joey,I never should have broken up with her.
105,Joey,Will you help me?
106,Joey,Please?
107,Ross,"Ok, bye."
108,Ross,"Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel."
109,Chandler,Oh.
110,Chandler,"Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?"
111,Ross,It's laundry.
112,Ross,The thinking through is minimal.
113,Chandler,"It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you?"
114,Chandler,This is a date.
115,Chandler,You're going on a date.
116,Ross,Nuh-uh.
117,Chandler,Yuh-huh.
118,Ross,So what're you saying here?
119,Ross,"I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?"
120,Chandler,"Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear."
121,Chandler,This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?
122,Ross,No.
123,Chandler,"Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?"
124,Ross,"Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles?"
125,Ross,"What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear."
126,Ross,"Ok, I can pick something else up on the way."
127,Chandler,There you go.
128,Monica,Thank you.
129,Monica,So what does this Bob guy look like?
130,Monica,Is he tall?
131,Monica,Short?
132,Joey,Yep.
133,Monica,Which?
134,Joey,Which what?
135,Monica,"You've never met Bob, have you?"
136,Joey,"No, but he's..."
137,Monica,"Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly..."
138,Monica,...horribly attractive.
139,Monica,I'll be shutting up now.
140,Chandler,Where are they?
141,Chandler,Where are they?
142,Phoebe,This is nice.
143,Phoebe,We never do anything just the two of us.
144,Chandler,It's great.
145,Chandler,Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
146,Phoebe,"Eww, I don't wanna do that."
147,Chandler,Here we go.
148,Phoebe,"Ok, have a good break-up."
149,Chandler,"Hey, Janice."
150,Chandler,"Hey, that's not good."
151,Chandler,"Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?"
152,Chandler,What?
153,Chandler,What... did you get me there?
154,Chandler,Bullwinkle socks.
155,Chandler,That's so sweet.
156,Chandler,That's great.
157,Chandler,"Well, I'm gonna get another espresso."
158,Chandler,Can I get you another latte?
159,Chandler,That's it?
160,Phoebe,"Yeah, it was really hard."
161,Chandler,"Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal."
162,Phoebe,"Ok, you weren't there."
163,Rachel,"Oh, 'scuse me."
164,Rachel,I was kinda using that machine.
165,Rachel,But I saved it.
166,Rachel,I put my basket on top.
167,Rachel,What?
168,Ross,What's goin' on?
169,Rachel,"Hi, uh, nothing."
170,Rachel,That horrible woman just took my machine.
171,Ross,Was your basket on top?
172,Rachel,"Yeah, but, there were no suds."
173,Ross,So?
174,Rachel,"Well, you know, no suds, no save."
175,Ross,No suds?
176,Ross,"Excuse me, hold on a second."
177,Ross,That's my friend's machine.
178,Ross,"Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it."
179,Ross,"All right, show's over."
180,Ross,Nothing to see here.
181,Ross,"Ok, let's do laundry."
182,Rachel,That was amazing.
183,Rachel,I can't even send back soup.
184,Ross,"Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent."
185,Rachel,What's that?
186,Ross,Uberveiss.
187,Ross,"It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough."
188,Ross,"Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?"
189,Rachel,Oh god.
190,Rachel,"Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz?"
191,Rachel,"I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?"
192,Ross,"Rach, have you never done this before?"
193,Rachel,"Well, not myself, but I know other people that have."
194,Rachel,"Ok, you caught me."
195,Rachel,I'm a laundry virgin.
196,Ross,"Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle."
197,Ross,"Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things."
198,Rachel,"Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties."
199,Rachel,Would they go with whites or delicates?
200,Ross,"Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call."
201,Monica,He is so cute.
202,Monica,"So, where did you guys grow up?"
203,Monica,"How, how did that happen?"
204,Joey,Oh my god.
205,Monica,What?
206,Joey,I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling.
207,Joey,But I'm not.
208,Joey,Commercial Break
209,Joey,"So, you and Angela, huh?"
210,Joey,You're a lucky man.
211,Joey,You know what I miss the most about her?
212,Joey,That cute nibbly noise when she eats.
213,Joey,"Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel."
214,Joey,"Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it."
215,Joey,"Yeah, but it's not gonna last."
216,Joey,She's too much for me in bed.
217,Joey,Sexually.
218,Monica,"I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific."
219,Monica,"It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight."
220,Monica,Wow.
221,Monica,My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
222,Phoebe,"Ok, you can do this."
223,Phoebe,It's just like pulling off a Band-aid.
224,Phoebe,"Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed."
225,Chandler,Janice.
226,Chandler,"Hi, Janice."
227,Chandler,"Ok, here we go."
228,Chandler,I don't think we should go out anymore.
229,Chandler,Janice.
230,Rachel,"Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do."
231,Ross,That does not sound stupid to me.
232,Ross,"You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me?"
233,Ross,"I'm sorry, that's all the time we have."
234,Ross,Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
235,Rachel,What uh-oh?
236,Ross,"Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done."
237,Ross,"It's, uh, it's a song."
238,Ross,The laundry song that we sing.
239,Ross,"Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh."
240,Rachel,"Ross, what's the matter?"
241,Ross,"Nothing, nothing."
242,Ross,"Lee-lo, the laundry's done."
243,Rachel,"Come on, show me."
244,Ross,"All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink."
245,Rachel,"Oh, everything's pink."
246,Ross,"Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red."
247,Ross,"I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone."
248,Rachel,Except it didn't.
249,Rachel,It happened to me.
250,Rachel,"Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep."
251,Rachel,What am I doing?
252,Rachel,What am I doing?
253,Rachel,My father's right.
254,Rachel,I can't live on my own!
255,Rachel,I can't even do laundry!
256,Monica,"Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate."
257,Monica,"So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is."
258,Monica,"Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?"
259,Monica,Oh my god.
260,Joey,What?
261,Monica,Hello!
262,Monica,Were we at the same table?
263,Monica,It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
264,Joey,"Come on, they're close."
265,Monica,Close?
266,Monica,She's got her tongue in his ear.
267,Joey,"Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross."
268,Monica,"Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?"
269,Joey,"Well, who's to say what's true?"
270,Joey,I mean...
271,Monica,"Oh my god, what were you thinking?"
272,Joey,"All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok?"
273,Joey,"Well, maybe I am a little."
274,Monica,Oh!
275,Joey,Ow!
276,Monica,I'm outta here.
277,Joey,"Wait, wait, wait."
278,Joey,"You want him, I want her."
279,Joey,He likes you.
280,Monica,Really?
281,Joey,Yeah.
282,Joey,"I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up."
283,Monica,"I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story."
284,Joey,"Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here."
285,Chandler,"Here's the thing, Janice."
286,Chandler,"You know, I mean, it's like we're different."
287,Chandler,"I'm like the bing, bing, bing."
288,Chandler,"You're like the boom, boom, ... boom."
289,Chandler,"Oh, my god, I'm so sorry."
290,Chandler,Are you ok?
291,Chandler,I hit her in the eye!
292,Chandler,I hit her in the eye!
293,Chandler,This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
294,Phoebe,Oh my god.
295,Phoebe,How many of those have you had?
296,Chandler,"Oh, I don't know, a million?"
297,Phoebe,"Chandler, easy, easy."
298,Phoebe,Go to your happy place.
299,Phoebe,La la la la la la la.
300,Chandler,I'm fine.
301,Phoebe,All right.
302,Chandler,I'm not fine.
303,Chandler,Here she comes.
304,Phoebe,Wait here.
305,Phoebe,Breathe.
306,Chandler,How do you do that?
307,Phoebe,It's like a gift.
308,Chandler,We should always always break up together.
309,Phoebe,"Oh, I'd like that."
310,Ross,You got the clothes clean.
311,Ross,Now that's the important part.
312,Rachel,"Oh, I guess."
313,Rachel,Except everything looks like jammies now.
314,Rachel,"Whoa, I'm sorry."
315,Rachel,Excuse me.
316,Rachel,We had this cart.
317,Rachel,"I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear."
318,Rachel,"Uh, this is our cart."
319,Rachel,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!"
320,Rachel,"All right, listen, missy."
321,Rachel,"If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!"
322,Rachel,Yes!
323,Rachel,Did you see that?
324,Ross,You were incredible!
325,Ross,"Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen."
326,Rachel,I could not have done this without you.
327,Ross,"Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer?"
328,Ross,"I'm fine, I'm fine."
329,Rachel,Are you sure?
330,Ross,No.
331,Ross,Closing Credits
332,Rachel,"Oh, are you sure you're ok?"
333,Ross,Yeah.
334,Rachel,Does it still hurt?
335,Ross,Yeah.
336,Phoebe,What a neat idea.
337,Phoebe,All your clothes match.
338,Phoebe,I'm gonna do this.
339,Monica,Hi.
340,Phoebe,"Hey, how'd it go?"
341,Joey,Excellent.
342,Monica,"We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves."
343,Ross,What a beautiful story.
344,Ross,"Hey, I'm fine by the way."
345,Monica,"Oh, I'm sorry."
346,Rachel,Where's Chandler?
347,Phoebe,"Oh, he needed some time to grieve."
348,Chandler,I'm free!
349,Chandler,I'm free!
350,Phoebe,That oughta do it.
351,Phoebe,End
0,Joey,"Morning, roomie!"
1,Rachel,Hey!
2,Rachel,You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
3,Joey,Fifth day's a charm.
4,Rachel,"Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here."
5,Rachel,"I gotta tell you, you're       making it so easy on me and Emma."
6,Joey,"Hey, it's great having you back."
7,Joey,"You know, stay as long as you want,       and when does she stop crying all night?"
8,Ross,"Hey, you're not naked!"
9,Ross,"So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you       tonight?"
10,Rachel,"Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's       in the bedroom all ready to go."
11,Rachel,"But she did actually fall back to sleep,       so..."
12,Joey,She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did       last night.
13,Rachel,Bye!
14,Ross,Bye!
15,Ross,"Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you."
16,Joey,"No, hey, it's been great."
17,Ross,Yeah?
18,Joey,Yeah.
19,Joey,"And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying       here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay?"
20,Joey,"And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using       a breast pump..."
21,Ross,"Yeah, that'll do it."
22,Joey,Wow!
23,Joey,"So, how are you?"
24,Ross,"I'm, I'm okay."
25,Joey,Really?
26,Ross,"Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have       worked out?"
27,Ross,Of course.
28,Ross,"You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's       a divorce."
29,Joey,"Well, actually it..."
30,Ross,"No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce!"
31,Ross,"Anyway, I think Rachel       and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing       other people."
32,Joey,"Wow, really?"
33,Ross,"Yeah, sure, why not?"
34,Ross,"In fact, if you know anyone that would be good       for me..."
35,Joey,"Sure, I know lots of girls."
36,Ross,Yeah?
37,Ross,Any names come to mind?
38,Joey,"Ooh, names?"
39,Joey,Opening credits.
40,Phoebe,Hey.
41,Joey,Hey.
42,Joey,I was just gonna get something to eat.
43,Joey,You want something?
44,Phoebe,What you got?
45,Phoebe,Joey
46,Phoebe,Goodie!
47,Phoebe,Thanks.
48,Phoebe,"So, how is it living with Rachel again?"
49,Phoebe,"I mean, apart       from the great food."
50,Joey,"I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with       her and Ross."
51,Joey,"You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody."
52,Phoebe,"Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too."
53,Joey,Why are they doing this?
54,Phoebe,I don't know.
55,Phoebe,They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.
56,Joey,You know what's crazy?
57,Joey,These jars.
58,Joey,"What is it, like two bites in       here?"
59,Phoebe,I just wish they'd realise they should be together.
60,Joey,"I know, I know."
61,Joey,"And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know,       that's where things were headed."
62,Phoebe,I know.
63,Phoebe,They should be a family.
64,Phoebe,They should get married and have       more children.
65,Joey,"Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey."
66,Joey,I may not have       kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.
67,Phoebe,You know what?
68,Phoebe,"Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's       out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other."
69,Joey,"Yeah, because it is slim pickings."
70,Joey,I had this date last
71,Phoebe,"So, what are we gonna do?"
72,Phoebe,Are we just gonna go ahead and set them       up with people?
73,Joey,I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.
74,Phoebe,Yeah.
75,Phoebe,"Oh, I know what we can do."
76,Phoebe,"We could set Ross and Rachel       up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together."
77,Joey,"Ooh, that's a great plan!"
78,Phoebe,"Yeah, you know what the best part of it is?"
79,Phoebe,"I get to do my ""plan-laugh."""
80,Joey,Shhh!
81,Joey,"Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh..."
82,Rachel,Hey!
83,Monica,Hey!
84,Rachel,"You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?"
85,Chandler,"See, now, why would you assume that?"
86,Chandler,Just because we're married?
87,Chandler,"I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people."
88,Chandler,"Now, if you'll       excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries."
89,Rachel,I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.
90,Monica,"Sure, we'll do that."
91,Monica,What are you up to?
92,Rachel,"Well, Phoebe set me up on a date."
93,Monica,Oh my god.
94,Chandler,Wow.
95,Rachel,Why?
96,Rachel,What's the big deal?
97,Monica,"Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are..."
98,Rachel,"What, slept together a year and a half ago?"
99,Rachel,"Yeah, I'm all set."
100,Chandler,"Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know?"
101,Chandler,"I       mean, it sounds healthy."
102,Chandler,"I mean, you have needs."
103,Chandler,Embrace your womanhood!
104,Monica,You want a job?
105,Monica,"Turn off ""Oprah,"" and send out a resume!"
106,Rachel,So I'll bring her by around seven?
107,Rachel,Is that okay?
108,Monica,"Oh, it's perfect."
109,Rachel,"Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun!"
110,Rachel,She's at such a cute age.
111,Rachel,"Oh, a couple things."
112,Rachel,"Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around       the clock."
113,Rachel,"And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it."
114,Rachel,"And       oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody       murder, but ah..."
115,Rachel,"Thanks, you guys."
116,Rachel,Have fun!
117,Rachel,Chandler
118,Phoebe,"Ooh, Joey."
119,Joey,Hey.
120,Phoebe,Hey.
121,Phoebe,I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.
122,Joey,All right!
123,Joey,Who is he?
124,Phoebe,"Well, it's this guy I used to massage."
125,Phoebe,"And by massage, I mean hold       down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me."
126,Phoebe,Joey
127,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah."
128,Joey,She's this really boring woman.
129,Joey,She's a teacher!
130,Phoebe,A teacher?
131,Joey,"Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh,       oh, she loves puzzles."
132,Joey,Huh?
133,Joey,"Come on, who loves puzzles?"
134,Phoebe,"Well, Ross does."
135,Phoebe,What... You're - you're ruining the plan!
136,Phoebe,"Joey,       you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!"
137,Joey,"Oh my god, you're right!"
138,Phoebe,Yeah.
139,Joey,She even reads for pleasure!
140,Phoebe,How do you even know a woman like that?
141,Joey,What?
142,Joey,I'm not allowed to know smart women?
143,Phoebe,Joey.
144,Joey,I met her at the library.
145,Joey,I went in to pee.
146,Phoebe,So now what do we do?
147,Joey,"Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled,       and find him somebody else."
148,Phoebe,What if we don't find him somebody else?
149,Phoebe,"We'll just tell her the       date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets       stood up!"
150,Joey,Ooh...I hear that's bad.
151,Phoebe,"Ooh, so this is great!"
152,Phoebe,"Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross       gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together."
153,Joey,"Ah, yes, The Plan!"
154,Phoebe,It's not Santa's plan.
155,Phoebe,"No, it's..."
156,Joey,"Yeah, you know, it's not that fun."
157,Phoebe,"No, I think we killed it."
158,Chandler,Emma?
159,Chandler,Emma?
160,Chandler,Look at me!
161,Chandler,"Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while."
162,Chandler,"No, no, no, no!"
163,Chandler,"No, no, no, no!"
164,Chandler,"It's okay, it's okay."
165,Chandler,I didn't go.
166,Chandler,"Don't cry, it's just a bit!"
167,Chandler,I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!
168,Monica,"Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until       the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours."
169,Chandler,I don't do that.
170,Chandler,I'll try to stop.
171,Chandler,"Wait, did you say until the sixth?"
172,Monica,Yeah.
173,Chandler,Today is the sixth.
174,Monica,"No, it's not."
175,Chandler,"Yes, it's also 2003."
176,Monica,Oh my god.
177,Monica,Today's the sixth?!
178,Monica,I may be done ovulating!
179,Monica,I may have       also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.
180,Chandler,It's okay.
181,Chandler,Go take the test and see if we're okay.
182,Monica,Okay.
183,Chandler,Tough crib.
184,Monica,"Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks?"
185,Monica,There's only one here.
186,Chandler,I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.
187,Monica,Chandler!
188,Chandler,I am not working.
189,Chandler,There's not much to do around here!
190,Ross,"Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar?"
191,Ross,"Someone average height,       dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?"
192,Ross,"Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me."
193,Ross,"Nah, I don't know if I should."
194,Ross,I don't wanna be drunk when I go home       alone.
195,Ross,"Yeah, it's no big deal."
196,Ross,It's just a blind date.
197,Ross,No!
198,Monica,We're okay.
199,Monica,I'm still ovulating.
200,Chandler,"Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not."
201,Monica,"So, let's do this."
202,Chandler,I - I don't think I can.
203,Monica,Come on.
204,Monica,"I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute."
205,Chandler,Because of Emma.
206,Monica,"Oh my god, Emma."
207,Monica,"Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here."
208,Monica,"Oh, you're       right, we can't do this."
209,Monica,We can't leave her alone.
210,Chandler,Sorry.
211,Monica,Unless... Maybe we do it here.
212,Monica,"I mean, how much can she even be aware       of at this age?"
213,Chandler,"Well, she's aware when we leave the room."
214,Chandler,She may notice if we start...       canoodling in it.
215,Monica,Canoodling?
216,Chandler,"Well, I can't say ""hump"" or ""screw"" in front       of the B-A-B-Y."
217,Monica,I don't know.
218,Monica,"I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't       so..."
219,Chandler,Horrifying?
220,Chandler,Scarring?
221,Chandler,Something people go to jail for?
222,Monica,I guess you're right.
223,Chandler,You guess I'm right?
224,Chandler,"When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you       wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through       the window."
225,Monica,But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?
226,Rachel,"Wow, everything looks so good!"
227,Rachel,I think I'm gonna have the chicken.
228,Rachel,Steve
229,Rachel,"Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet."
230,Rachel,Thank you.
231,Rachel,What?
232,Rachel,"Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter."
233,Rachel,"Hey, now       wait a minute."
234,Rachel,Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant.
235,Rachel,That's impressive.
236,Rachel,Really?
237,Rachel,What's that like?
238,Rachel,Really?
239,Phoebe,Hello?
240,Rachel,"Phoebe, it's me."
241,Rachel,I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!
242,Phoebe,"Hey, Rach!"
243,Rachel,This is the worst date ever.
244,Rachel,How could you set me up with this creep?
245,Phoebe,"You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends."
246,Rachel,I don't care!
247,Rachel,This guy is a nightmare!
248,Phoebe,"Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned."
249,Rachel,He's not stoned.
250,Phoebe,Did he go out for a cigarette?
251,Rachel,"Yeah, four times."
252,Phoebe,"My dear, sweet Rach."
253,Phoebe,Phoebe
254,Joey,"Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together."
255,Phoebe,"By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny       Mexico."
256,Phoebe,"Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan."
257,Monica,She's asleep.
258,Monica,Chandler?
259,Monica,What are you doing?
260,Chandler,Emma was doing it!
261,Monica,She's asleep.
262,Chandler,"Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can..."
263,Monica,"Yes, but we have to be fast."
264,Monica,Chandler
265,Joey,Hello?
266,Joey,Emma?
267,Joey,Hey!
268,Joey,Hi!
269,Joey,How are ya?
270,Joey,How are ya?
271,Joey,"Where are your babysitters, huh?"
272,Joey,Why's the       bedroom door closed?
273,Joey,"You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!"
274,Ross,"Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be."
275,Ross,"Wow, free crab cakes."
276,Ross,"Well, that's nice."
277,Ross,Although I was hoping to       have sex tonight.
278,Ross,Just the crab cakes.
279,Ross,Waiter #2
280,Ross,What's - what's going on?
281,Ross,What?
282,Ross,You - you're making money off my misery?
283,Ross,This is unbelievable.
284,Ross,I - I have never been so insulted in my life.
285,Ross,"Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way."
286,Monica,"Well, that was weird."
287,Monica,"You were loud, and I was fast."
288,Chandler,I think we may have really done it this time.
289,Monica,"Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test."
290,Chandler,You may wanna get some more of those too.
291,Chandler,Where's Emma?
292,Monica,"Oh my god, where's Emma?"
293,Monica,Where's Emma?
294,Chandler,"Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!"
295,Monica,"Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma."
296,Monica,"You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell."
297,Chandler,Okay.
298,Monica,"Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another,       we're giving a baby back to Rachel."
299,Rachel,"No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry."
300,Rachel,Don't touch my coat!
301,Rachel,"Oh, sorry, it's my phone."
302,Rachel,Hello?
303,Rachel,Monica
304,Rachel,"Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!"
305,Rachel,Rachel
306,Monica,"Hey, did you stop by here?"
307,Rachel,No.
308,Monica,"Oh my god, then..."
309,Monica,"Oh, thank god!"
310,Monica,"Emma, there you are!"
311,Rachel,What?
312,Rachel,"What do you mean, ""there you are""?"
313,Rachel,Where was she?
314,Monica,"Oh, we were playing ""peek-a-boo."""
315,Monica,She just  she loves       it when I'm dramatic.
316,Monica,Monica
317,Joey,Because you two were having sex!
318,Monica,"No, we weren't!"
319,Joey,Don't you lie to me!
320,Joey,I could tell by Chandler's hair.
321,Joey,You are so lazy.
322,Joey,Can't you get on top for once?
323,Chandler,"All right, all right, we were."
324,Chandler,We were trying to make a baby.
325,Chandler,Monica's       ovulating.
326,Joey,Hey!
327,Joey,It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in       the next room.
328,Joey,I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.
329,Chandler,"No, no, no."
330,Monica,"No, please don't."
331,Monica,"Please, Joey."
332,Monica,She will kill us!
333,Joey,"Hey, I gotta!"
334,Joey,Unless...
335,Monica,Unless what?
336,Joey,Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.
337,Chandler,What?
338,Chandler,Why?
339,Joey,"Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family       name."
340,Chandler,Your family name is Tribbiani.
341,Joey,You almost had me.
342,Rachel,"Well, uh..."
343,Rachel,"Really, really not."
344,Rachel,"All right, well that's good to know."
345,Rachel,"Good night, Steve."
346,Ross,"Hey, what's wrong?"
347,Rachel,I just had a rough night.
348,Ross,Oh.
349,Ross,Crab cake?
350,Rachel,Eww!
351,Ross,"Well, what happened?"
352,Rachel,"Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but..."
353,Ross,Monica told me you had a blind date.
354,Rachel,Yeah.
355,Ross,"I did, too."
356,Rachel,Oh.
357,Ross,But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?
358,Rachel,"Oh, oh no."
359,Rachel,"Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?"
360,Ross,Why does everyone keep saying that?
361,Rachel,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown       up."
362,Ross,That bad?
363,Rachel,"Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be       appropriate to give me this."
364,Ross,Female body inspector?
365,Ross,What size is that?
366,Phoebe,"Now, wait a minute."
367,Phoebe,"So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?"
368,Joey,Uh-huh.
369,Phoebe,How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?
370,Joey,"It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex."
371,Phoebe,"Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes."
372,Phoebe,Oh my god!
373,Phoebe,"Look, it's Ross and Rachel."
374,Phoebe,"Oh, the plan is working."
375,Phoebe,"Don't, don't do the plan-laugh."
376,Ross,"The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters."
377,Rachel,Oh.
378,Rachel,Huh.
379,Rachel,"You know, it is weird that Phoebe would       set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you       up on a date that didn't even show."
380,Ross,Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional?
381,Ross,"I mean, that's       just stupid."
382,Joey,We're geniuses!
383,Joey,"Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really       bonding."
384,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again."
385,Phoebe,"Oh, they see us!"
386,Phoebe,"Oh, they, they look mad."
387,Phoebe,"Oh, they figured it out."
388,Phoebe,They're coming this way.
389,Phoebe,Run!
390,Joey,Where?
391,Phoebe,Mexico!
392,Phoebe,End credits.
393,Joey,Can you believe they're still not here?
394,Ross,I know.
395,Ross,"A double blind date, and we both get stood up."
396,Ross,What are the       chances?
397,Joey,"I know, I'm so bummed."
398,Joey,Can we have our free crab cakes now?
399,Joey,We've been stood up.
400,Joey,And we want our free crab cakes.
0,Monica,You look cute in bubbles.
1,Chandler,"Ehh, you're just liquored up."
2,Joey,"Hey, it's me!"
3,Joey,I'm comin' in!
4,Chandler,"I've had a very long, hard day."
5,Joey,"Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken."
6,Joey,Want some?
7,Chandler,"Ahh, no thanks."
8,Chandler,"No chicken, bye-bye then."
9,Joey,Okay.
10,Joey,You sure?
11,Joey,Some extra crispy?
12,Joey,Dirty rice?
13,Joey,Beans?
14,Chandler,For the last time no!
15,Chandler,Get out!
16,Chandler,"Get out, Joey!"
17,Joey,All right!
18,Chandler,Are you okay?
19,Chandler,"I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave."
20,Chandler,He kept asking me about chicken.
21,Monica,Chicken?
22,Monica,I could eat some chicken.
23,Chandler,Hey Joe!
24,Chandler,"Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke--Diet Coke."
25,Chandler,Opening Credits
26,Phoebe,Hey!
27,Chandler,"Hey, Pheebs!"
28,Joey,Mornin' Pheebs!
29,Phoebe,I have to tell you this story.
30,Phoebe,"Okay, I was coming over here and this driver"
31,Joey,Was his name Angus?
32,Phoebe,What?
33,Joey,"Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London."
34,Phoebe,Oh.
35,Phoebe,Ha-ha-ha.
36,Phoebe,"All right, anyway"
37,Monica,"Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?"
38,Chandler,"Uh, The Wheatsheaf."
39,Joey,"Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer!"
40,Joey,That uh
41,Monica,Bodington's!
42,Chandler,Ooh!
43,Chandler,"Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story."
44,Phoebe,"Yeah, so, he had a really funny hatI don't want to talk about it."
45,Ross,Hey!
46,Joey,"Hey, Ross, Bodington's!"
47,Ross,Yeah!
48,Joey,That was good beer.
49,Ross,Ohh
50,Joey,"Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys."
51,Ross,"Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center."
52,Joey,Later!
53,Ross,Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
54,Monica,"Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens."
55,Monica,"But actually,  she should be here by now."
56,Ross,"Oh, so-so you talked to her."
57,Ross,"Did she, did she sound mad?"
58,Monica,"No, but she likes me."
59,Monica,You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
60,Ross,"Okay, I did not abandon Rachel!"
61,Ross,Okay?
62,Ross,Emily showed up at the airport!
63,Ross,I had to go after her!
64,Ross,"I mean, I-I did what I had to do!"
65,Ross,She's my wife!
66,Ross,Rachel is my wife!
67,Ross,Y'knowEmily!
68,Ross,"Emily, is my wife!"
69,Ross,"Man, what is that?"
70,Phoebe,So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
71,Ross,"No, not since I lost her at the airport."
72,Chandler,I can't believe she can out run you man!
73,Ross,"HEY, SHE'S FAST!!"
74,Ross,OKAY?!!
75,Ross,Oh!
76,Ross,You-you think you can be beat me?
77,Ross,Let's go!
78,Ross,Outside!
79,Rachel,Hi!
80,Ross,"Rach, Rach, I am so sorry."
81,Ross,I am so-so sorry.
82,Rachel,"Oh Ross, come on!"
83,Rachel,You just did what you had to do.
84,Ross,That's it?
85,Ross,You're not mad?
86,Ross,"I mean, it must've been terrible."
87,Rachel,Terrible?
88,Rachel,"Hell, I was in Greece!"
89,Rachel,That was a nice hotel!
90,Rachel,"Nice beach, met the nice people."
91,Rachel,Not to shabby for Rachel.
92,Ross,"So, what?"
93,Ross,That's it?
94,Rachel,"Well, yeah!"
95,Rachel,We're cool.
96,Rachel,Totally cool.
97,Ross,"Oh, thanks."
98,Ross,"Oh, you're the best."
99,Rachel,"Oh no, you're the best."
100,Ross,"Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store!"
101,Ross,"Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her."
102,Ross,That oughta get her talking to me again.
103,Chandler,"Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY."
104,Monica,"Rach, that's great!"
105,Monica,It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
106,Rachel,What?!
107,Rachel,I didn't have a good time in Greece!
108,Rachel,Ross abandoned me!
109,Rachel,"Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, ""Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?"""
110,Rachel,"I mean, it was sooo humiliating."
111,Rachel,I felt like such an idiot!
112,Rachel,"I mean, it's all my fault!"
113,Rachel,"And you know why, because I make very bad decisions."
114,Chandler,Oh that's not true.
115,Rachel,Yes it is!
116,Rachel,It is true!
117,Rachel,"I went, I went after Ross in stupid London."
118,Phoebe,London is stupid!
119,Phoebe,Stupid!
120,Rachel,"Phoebe, you were right."
121,Rachel,"I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me."
122,Phoebe,"Oh No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life."
123,Monica,I'll do it!
124,Rachel,That's fine.
125,Rachel,"So Monica, you are now in control of my love life."
126,Chandler,"Okay, I gotta go to work."
127,Chandler,"And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back."
128,Chandler,Pheebs!
129,Chandler,Always a pleasure.
130,Monica,"Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception."
131,Rachel,"Ohh, he's married!"
132,Rachel,Ross is married.
133,Rachel,I can'tI still can't believe it.
134,Monica,"Honey, sweetie, by the edges."
135,Rachel,"I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it"
136,Monica,Ohh.
137,Rachel,I mean it's my fault.
138,Monica,Sweetie!
139,Monica,Edges!
140,Monica,Fingers!
141,Monica,Smudgey!
142,Monica,Pictures!
143,Rachel,Oh my God!
144,Monica,Okay.
145,Monica,That's okay.
146,Monica,I-I know that you're very upset right now.
147,Monica,"I know, I know that wasn't about me."
148,Joey,I bet it was about her a little.
149,Monica,If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere!
150,Monica,"I mean, look!"
151,Monica,"Look, Gunther!"
152,Monica,"I mean, he's nice, he's cute."
153,Rachel,"Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda"
154,Monica,"Oh, what about that guy over there?"
155,Monica,Remember?
156,Monica,That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
157,Rachel,"Oh, I don't know."
158,Rachel,I don't know.
159,Monica,You're going to talk to him!
160,Monica,Y'know what?
161,Monica,"We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him."
162,Rachel,"All right, you're the boss."
163,Rachel,I guess I gotta do what you tell me.
164,Joey,Say that to him and you're golden.
165,Phoebe,Hey!
166,Rachel,Hey!
167,Joey,"Hey, Pheebs!"
168,Monica,We got out pictures back from London.
169,Monica,Here's all of us at the Tower of London.
170,Phoebe,Oh!
171,Phoebe,Here we all are!
172,Phoebe,"Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me."
173,Chandler,"All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?"
174,Phoebe,No.
175,Phoebe,I'm sorry.
176,Phoebe,It's just 'cause I couldn't be there.
177,Phoebe,"'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out."
178,Monica,What happened?
179,Rachel,"Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that."
180,Rachel,Got myself a date tomorrow night.
181,Monica,"See, didn't I tell you?!"
182,Monica,You're getting over Ross already!
183,Rachel,Well
184,Monica,What took you so long?
185,Chandler,"I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow."
186,Monica,"Oh, good."
187,Chandler,"So, thanks for having me over!"
188,Chandler,Rach.
189,Chandler,Pheebs.
190,Joey,See ya!!
191,Joey,What the hell was that?
192,Monica,"Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London."
193,Rachel,That's not European!
194,Phoebe,"Well, it felt French."
195,Rachel,"Oh God, I really had a good time!"

203,Ross,Hi.
204,Rachel,Is Monica around?
205,Rachel,I-I have to ask her something.
206,Ross,She's doing her laundry.
207,Rachel,What's that?
208,Ross,"It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!"
209,Rachel,"Oh, honey that's awful."
210,Ross,"Oh, it's not so bad."
211,Ross,Monica's gonna make potpourri!
212,Ross,I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
213,Rachel,"But, it's not raining."
214,Ross,I can't catch a break!
215,Rachel,Y'know what Ross?
216,Rachel,You're not going anywhere.
217,Rachel,You're gonna sit right here.

226,Monica,Can I talk to for just a minute?
227,Monica,I-I dropped some socks.
228,Rachel,Yeah.
229,Monica,What is the matter with you?!
230,Monica,Do you want to fall into the trap?
231,Monica,Do you want to fall into the trap?
232,Rachel,Ohh!
233,Rachel,You did not drop any socks!
234,Monica,I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off!
235,Monica,"I mean, you listen to me!"
236,Monica,"Now, I'm calling the shots!"
237,Monica,I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave!
238,Monica,What the hell were you trying to do?
239,Rachel,"Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wantedtell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him."
240,Monica,What?!!
241,Monica,You cannot tell him that!
242,Rachel,Why?
243,Rachel,Why not?!
244,Rachel,People love to hear that!
245,Monica,"I make the decisions, and I say no."
246,Rachel,"Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired."
247,Monica,You can't fire me.
248,Monica,"I make your decisions and I say, ""I'm not fired!"""

268,Rachel,Yes!
269,Ross,What thing?
270,Monica,"Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons."
271,Monica,Which I think is a really stupid idea!
272,Monica,"It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might  end up hurting."
273,Ross,"Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky."
274,Ross,I'm gonna use the phone.
275,Ross,I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily.
276,Ross,"My God, think of the massacre."
277,Rachel,I'm gonna do it.
278,Monica,"All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea."
279,Monica,"Because I bet you, you can't."
280,Rachel,But I

289,Phoebe,Yeah?
290,Joey,"All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!"
291,Phoebe,"Ohh, that's so nice!"
292,Phoebe,How great!
293,Phoebe,"Well, where?"
294,Phoebe,Where's the trip?

303,Phoebe,"""Well, it's right by my house, all right!"""

305,Rachel,Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!!
306,Rachel,"Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey!"
307,Rachel,"Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I justy'knowstop it!"
308,Chandler,I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
309,Phoebe,"That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth."
310,Monica,Makes me wanna puke!
311,Ross,"Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!"

316,Phoebe,Hi.
317,Chandler,"Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little Y'know, it didn't have any It-it, well it blew."
318,Chandler,"So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!"
319,Phoebe,"Ooh, Atlantic City!"
320,Phoebe,"Oh, that's a great plan!"
321,Phoebe,Who's plan was that?

335,Monica,No!
336,Monica,"Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him."
337,Rachel,"Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter."
338,Monica,"Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?"
339,Rachel,"Yeah, I-I don't care."
340,Monica,Okay.
341,Monica,I-I can't watch.
342,Rachel,What 'cha readin'?

346,Rachel,Okay.
347,Rachel,"Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong."
348,Rachel,"I mean, and you know how people can be wrong."
349,Ross,Sure.
350,Ross,"Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized"
351,Rachel,"Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here."

365,Rachel,I'm totally serious.
366,Ross,Why are you laughing?
367,Rachel,"Because , because, I just heard it."
368,Rachel,"I heard it, and it's ridiculous!"
369,Rachel,"I mean, you're married."
370,Rachel,"You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know?"
371,Rachel,"And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel  was like, ""You are such an idiot!"""
372,Ross,"Well, well I am married."
373,Ross,Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
374,Rachel,"I'm sorry, that's not funny."
375,Ross,"Actually, it kinda is."
376,Ross,My wife won't return my calls.
377,Ross,I don't know where my wife is.
378,Ross,"""Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?"""
379,Ross,Don't know!
380,Rachel,"Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?"
381,Ross,"Well, I kinda half to."
382,Ross,"I mean, because the thing is"
383,Rachel,"The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily."
384,Ross,That is what the thing is.
385,Rachel,"Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right?"
386,Rachel,"I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?"
387,Ross,No.
388,Ross,No.
389,Ross,"No, I'm-I'm glad you did."
390,Ross,"Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you."

415,Chandler,"I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex."
416,Monica,Do you know anything about women?
417,Chandler,No.

7,Rachel,Oh!
8,Rachel,I would love to read a poem.
9,Chandler,Do you think you could get through a poem?
10,Rachel,It'll be a short one.
11,Monica,"Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading."
12,Rachel,Ohhh
13,Ross,Okay.
14,Ross,"Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too."
15,Chandler,Too?
16,Ross,"Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys."
17,Monica,Do you mind telling us what it is?
18,Ross,"Sorry, I'm kinda keeping this one on the Q.T."

28,Chandler,So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
29,Rachel,"Wait, what do you mean you're getting a new brain?"
30,Joey,"Oh well, they're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body."
31,Ross,What?
32,Ross,A brain transplant?
33,Joey,"Yes, it's a highly controversial procedure."
34,Ross,It's ridiculous!
35,Joey,"Well, I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months."
36,Ross,"It's winter, they are fewer people on the street."
37,Monica,Who are they killing off?
38,Joey,"Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart."
39,Joey,Rachel and
40,Monica,Noo!
41,Monica,She's my favorite character on DOOL.
42,Joey,Nice.
43,Rachel,"She is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces, I mean I don't think I've ever seen her finish a beverage."
44,Monica,And the way she slaps all the time!
45,Rachel,Oh!
46,Monica,Wouldn't you love to do it just once?
47,Chandler,Don't do it.
48,Rachel,"Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress."
49,Joey,"Oh, tell me about it."
50,Joey,"And she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes."
51,Ross,"Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the ""brain transplant,"" you are going to be her?"
52,Joey,"Yes, but in Drake Remoray's body."
53,Joey,Why is this so hard for you to get?

56,Phoebe,"Rach, so, that guy there."
57,Phoebe,Straight or gay?
58,Rachel,"Well, I'd have to say gay."
59,Phoebe,Yeah?
60,Phoebe,Why?
61,Rachel,Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
62,Phoebe,Oh no not that guy there.
63,Phoebe,That guy right there.
64,Rachel,Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
65,Phoebe,Ohh knockers will help us figure it out.
66,Rachel,"All right, straight, and not subtle."
67,Phoebe,"Ohh, he left his cell phone."
68,Rachel,"Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found."
69,Phoebe,Or we could use it to call China.
70,Phoebe,See how those guys are doing.
71,Rachel,"What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love."
72,Rachel,I mean wouldn't that be a great story?
73,Rachel,Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
74,Phoebe,Yeah That does sound great.
75,Phoebe,I'm going to get the phone.
76,Rachel,What?
77,Rachel,Wait!
78,Rachel,Whywhy do you get the story?
79,Phoebe,I don't know.
80,Phoebe,I haven't been out on a date in so long.
81,Rachel,"Phoebe, you had a date three days ago."
82,Phoebe,That wasn't a date!
83,Phoebe,"That was, that was just friends getting together having sex."
84,Rachel,Okay.
85,Rachel,"Okay, see?"
86,Rachel,I get the phone.
87,Phoebe,No way!
88,Phoebe,No way!
89,Phoebe,You just broke with Tag a week ago.
90,Rachel,Yeah!
91,Rachel,"And until now, I didn't think I'd love again."
92,Phoebe,Nice try.
93,Rachel,Oh hey-hey wait!
94,Rachel,How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
95,Phoebe,I don't know.
96,Rachel,"Well umm, maybe we could uhh  Ah-ha!"
97,Rachel,Too slow!
98,Phoebe,Ah-ha!
99,Phoebe,Too cocky!
100,Joey,That was a great scene!
101,Joey,And-and-and that slap looks so real!
102,Joey,How do you do that?
103,Joey,"Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are."
104,Joey,Say what?
105,Joey,No.
106,Joey,"No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday."
107,Joey,I-I'm the guy in the coma!
108,Joey,"An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me"
109,Joey,I don't know.
110,Joey,Why?
111,Joey,Did you hear something?
112,Joey,"Oh uh, one of the writers."
113,Joey,Umm
114,Joey,Okay.
115,Joey,Ms. Monroe  Oh there you go.
116,Rachel,No Phoebe!
117,Rachel,You cannot get the phone that way; that's not fair!
118,Rachel,"Okay look, I have an idea."
119,Rachel,"Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him."
120,Rachel,And then whoever does gets the phone.
121,Phoebe,"Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone."
122,Rachel,I don't think so.
123,Phoebe,"Fine all right, but I'd bet you'd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet."
124,Rachel,"All right, first name on the speed dial is mom."
125,Phoebe,"Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide."
126,Rachel,"Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin."
127,Phoebe,Did I use that already today?
128,Phoebe,I'm sorry.
129,Rachel,Yes okay.
130,Rachel,Well now see this isn't telling us anything.

140,Rachel,He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
141,Phoebe,So you don't know that's Barney's the store!
142,Phoebe,"That can be y'know his friend's house, or a bar."
143,Phoebe,Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial?
144,Rachel,His new girlfriend!
145,Monica,What is that?
146,Chandler,I think it's the dying cat parade.
147,Monica,It sounds like it's coming from across the street.
148,Chandler,Oh my God!
149,Monica,What?
150,Chandler,Y'know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?!
151,Chandler,"He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, ""You're half Scottish right?"""

170,Phoebe,Yeah.
171,Rachel,And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
172,Phoebe,Yeah!
173,Rachel,And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?
174,Phoebe,"Ooh, now you lost me."
175,Rachel,You stole the phone!
176,Phoebe,No I didn't!
177,Rachel,No?
178,Rachel,"So you're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?"
179,Phoebe,No.
180,Rachel,"Umm, okay."
181,Rachel,"But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag."
182,Rachel,"Oh, it does work!"

239,Joey,I can do an English accent?!
240,Joey,That baby's going on my resume!
241,Chandler,"Well, I feel like a snack!"
242,Monica,Do you want some shortbread?
243,Monica,Eh that's Scottish like you are.
244,Chandler,Oh no thanks.
245,Chandler,I don't like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
246,Ross,What?
247,Chandler,Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland byVikings.
248,Chandler,"Anyway, lots of bad memories."
249,Ross,"Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots."
250,Monica,No!
251,Monica,No-no they're not.
252,Monica,They're still very angry!
253,Monica,But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish.
254,Monica,You know what the Swedish people are famous for?
255,Monica,Sitting down and being quiet.
256,Ross,Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more
257,Monica,You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!
258,Ross,How did you know about that?
259,Chandler,We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
260,Ross,Were you the ones called the cops?
261,Chandler,That's not really important right now.
262,Chandler,"What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding."
263,Ross,Why not?
264,Chandler,Because we hate them.
265,Ross,Come on that's not fair!
266,Ross,I mean you haven't even heard me play!
267,Chandler,We have heard you play.
268,Ross,"No, you've heard my practice."
269,Ross,Okay?
270,Ross,Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want.
271,Ross,And I'm not going to tell you what song I'm gonna play either.
272,Ross,"But uh, let's just say when it's over I'll bet there will be a we bit o' celebration."

375,Joey,"Yeah well, I'm guessing after this she's not going to be crazy about electricity either."
376,Ross,now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
377,Rachel,I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
378,Ross,Do you wanna start telling secrets?

406,Phoebe,Eee!!
407,Phoebe,and Chandler  are laughing.
408,Phoebe,That then causes Lisa and Jennifer come out of character and start laughing hysterically.
409,Phoebe,And that finally causes David Schwimmer to come out of character and start laughing as well.
410,Phoebe,Matthew decides to sing along now as well.)
411,Phoebe,Matthew
0,Rachel,Okay.
1,Rachel,Hey.
2,Rachel,Umm.
3,Rachel,Does everybody hate these shoes?
4,Chandler,"Oh yeah, but don't worry."
5,Chandler,I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
6,Rachel,Tell him.
7,Ross,It's her first day at this new job.
8,Ross,Your not supposed to start with her!
9,Chandler,"All right, I suppose I can wait a day."
10,Chandler,"Hey, what are you doing Friday?"
11,Ross,Why?
12,Chandler,"I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist."
13,Ross,Oh God.
14,Ross,"Y'know, botanists are such geeks."
15,Chandler,Yeah.
16,Chandler,Is that a dinosaur tie?
17,Ross,Hmm?
18,Ross,"Oh, yeah."
19,Phoebe,Morning.
20,Phoebe,"Rach, I'm here with the purses!"
21,Chandler,It must take you forever to find your keys.
22,Rachel,"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs."
23,Phoebe,"Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles."
24,Rachel,"No, no, no, no turtles scare me."
25,Rachel,I don't need that today.
26,Ross,"Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine."
27,Ross,"Hey, umm,."
28,Ross,why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?
29,Rachel,"Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out."
30,Ross,"Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?"
31,Rachel,"Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing."
32,Rachel,Is this actually a lunchbox?
33,Phoebe,"Umm, no, it's a purse."
34,Phoebe,And there's a thermos in it.
35,Rachel,Oh.
36,Chandler,"Hey, so can you make it on Friday?"
37,Ross,What?
38,Ross,"Oh yeah, yeah I think so."
39,Ross,Why am I invited to this again?
40,Chandler,Well apparently Albert has no friends.
41,Chandler,He's very excited about the bachelor party though.
42,Chandler,I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
43,Phoebe,"A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so cliché."
44,Phoebe,Why don't you get a magician?
45,Chandler,"Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right."
46,Chandler,Opening Credits
47,Ross,She's having lunch with him.
48,Ross,She's having lunch with him.
49,Ross,And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job.
50,Ross,"And, and, and,  he's really good looking."
51,Ross,What am I gonna do?
52,Chandler,Don't do anything.
53,Chandler,Keep it inside.
54,Chandler,Learn how to hide your feelings!
55,Chandler,Don't cry outloud.
56,Joey,Yes!
57,Joey,Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
58,Chandler,"I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer."

60,Joey,It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities.
61,Joey,"So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco."
62,Ross,"Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities."

167,Phoebe,What?!
168,Phoebe,He was with her when he wrote this poem.
169,Phoebe,"Look,  'My vessel so empty with nothing inside."
170,Phoebe,"Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.'"
171,Phoebe,"He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!"
172,Chandler,You really think that is what he meant?
173,Phoebe,"Oh, totally."
174,Phoebe,"Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too."
175,Joey,Done.
176,Rachel,"Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm..."

189,Ross,"...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!"
190,Rachel,"Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious!"
191,Rachel,It was like you were marking your territory.
192,Rachel,I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!
193,Ross,I would never do that!
194,Rachel,"Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me."
195,Rachel,He said this is what you guys do.
196,Ross,"Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot."
197,Joey,Mark's a genius!
198,Ross,Why?!
199,Ross,How?!
200,Ross,How is he a genius?
201,Chandler,"Look, don't you see what's happening here."
202,Chandler,"Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant."
203,Chandler,Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
204,Ross,What am I going to do?
205,Chandler,"Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that."
206,Chandler,"All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits."
207,Ross,I don't know you guys.
208,Chandler,"All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you."
209,Chandler,"And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'"
210,Joey,"And before you know it, she's with him."
211,Joey,"And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!'"
212,Joey,"And he'll be all, 'Yes!'"
213,Joey,"And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.'"
214,Joey,"And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.'"
215,Joey,"And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'"
216,Chandler,He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
217,Rachel,Ohhh!
218,Rachel,That is soo sweet!
219,Ross,"All right that's, that's it!!"
220,Ross,Get off her!
221,Ross,What's going on?!
222,Ross,That's what's going on!
223,Rachel,Ross!
224,Ross,I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie!
225,Ross,What do I have to do to get some service?!
226,Ross,Hi Rach.
227,Joey,"So, does that mean the audition is off?"
228,Joey,What?
229,Joey,"It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands."

235,Phoebe,"Yeah, it's a vase."
236,Monica,"Yeah, just like the one in the poem."
237,Phoebe,Well not exactly like the one in the poem.
238,Monica,What do you mean?
239,Phoebe,Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry?
240,Phoebe,Oh.
241,Monica,So!
242,Monica,"I'm just an empty vase, huh?"
243,Monica,"Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else."
244,Monica,"And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog."
245,Monica,"Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things."
246,Monica,I care about my friends and family.
247,Monica,You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.
248,Monica,You don't even know me...
249,Monica,What?
250,Monica,"I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe..."
251,Monica,Oh yeah.
252,Joey,"I know, it was the best I could get out of them."
253,Joey,"People, people, people."
254,Rachel,"So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?"
255,Chandler,"Oh yeah, yeah!"
256,Chandler,"Look what I got, look what I got."
257,Chandler,"See, she's fully dressed, right?"
258,Rachel,Right.
259,Chandler,"And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked."
260,Chandler,"And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed."
261,Chandler,"She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and  whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked!"
262,Ross,Hi.
263,Rachel,Hello.
264,Chandler,"Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen."
265,Ross,"I'm sorry, I was an idiot."
266,Rachel,A big idiot.
267,Ross,A big idiot.
268,Ross,"Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me."
269,Rachel,"Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?"
270,Ross,"Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her."
271,Ross,And now if it's possible I think I love you even more.
272,Ross,"So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away."
273,Rachel,"Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous."
274,Ross,I gotta get going.
275,Ross,Bye Chandler.
276,Chandler,"Oh, okay Ross."
277,Chandler,"Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?"
278,Rachel,Where ya going?
279,Ross,"Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon."
280,Rachel,"Ohh, with who?"
281,Ross,"Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party."
282,Rachel,There was a woman at the...
283,Rachel,The stripper?
284,Ross,Yeah.
285,Rachel,You have a play date with a stripper?
286,Chandler,"Man, I gotta get a kid."
287,Ross,"Ah, yeah, yeah."
288,Ross,"Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing."
289,Ross,"And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class."
290,Ross,"Why, is that okay?"
291,Rachel,"Sure, is she married?"
292,Ross,"Ahh, no."
293,Rachel,Oh.
294,Ross,Are you jealous?
295,Rachel,"Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all."
296,Rachel,I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
297,Ross,You are totally jealous.
298,Rachel,I'm not jealous.
299,Rachel,"All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers."
300,Rachel,"And y'know, and um, I..."
301,Ross,"Honey, I love you too."
302,Rachel,Ugh.
303,Rachel,"Wait, wait, wait."
304,Ross,What?
305,Ross,Huh.
306,Rachel,"Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know."
307,Chandler,Yeah.
308,Chandler,"Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper."
309,Chandler,Closing Credits
0,Joey,"All right, all right, all right, let's play one more time, ok?"
1,Joey,"And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris."
2,Rachel,Ok!
3,Rachel,"Can't believe I'm risking  this again, but you're on!"
4,Rachel,"All right Joe, you remember the rules!"
5,Rachel,"Heads I win, tails you lose."
6,Joey,Just flip!
7,Joey,Rachel
8,Joey,Damnit!
9,Chandler,Hey!
10,Joey,Hey!
11,Chandler,So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
12,Rachel,"Oh, that sounds good!"
13,Monica,"Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?"
14,Rachel,It's all done!
15,Monica,"Oh, yeah, right!"
16,Monica,And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor!
17,Monica,"Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it."
18,Rachel,"I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all."
19,Rachel,"The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane..."
20,Monica,"Ok,  so you've done some good work!"
21,Monica,What about your carry-ons?
22,Rachel,"Oh, well."
23,Rachel,Everything that I need  is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.
24,Monica,Oh my God!
25,Monica,I have nothing left to teach you!
26,Chandler,Where's your passport?
27,Rachel,It should be right next to my plane ticket.
28,Chandler,"Well, it's not."
29,Rachel,What?
30,Rachel,Maybe I put it in here .
31,Rachel,"Oh, oh, it's not in there!"
32,Rachel,"Oh, no!"
33,Rachel,I must have packed it in one of these boxes!
34,Monica,"Here, let me help you."
35,Rachel,Shoot.
36,Rachel,"Oh, I can't believe I did this!"
37,Rachel,Chandler
38,Monica,"Oh, wow, can you believe you're like three weeks away?"
39,Monica,"You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?"
40,Ross,Hey!
41,Ross,"Hey Erica, welcome back to town!"
42,Ross,"Wow, look how big you've gotten."
43,Ross,"Right, no, I understand."
44,Ross,"No, no, I knew ."
45,Ross,Monica
46,Ross,She brought them up!
47,Ross,I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!
48,Monica,"Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel."
49,Ross,Hotel?
50,Ross,Why isn't she staying with you guys?
51,Monica,Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.
52,Ross,"Erica, those things aren't free."
53,Ross,In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
54,Monica,Ross!
55,Monica,She's giving us her baby.
56,Monica,She can eat you if she wants.
57,Monica,Erica
58,Ross,"Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place."
59,Monica,"Oh, I know."
60,Monica,I know.
61,Monica,"Hey, you know, you can take it if you want!"
62,Monica,The lease is still in Nana's name.
63,Ross,"No, no."
64,Ross,This will always be your place.
65,Ross,It would be too sad.
66,Ross,"Plus, how much a month does it cost  to feed Joey?"
67,Monica,"Yeah, it takes two incomes."
68,Ross,"Hey, is Chandler here?"
69,Ross,We talked about catching a movie.
70,Monica,"Oh, no."
71,Monica,He doesn't have time for that.
72,Monica,"But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room."
73,Ross,"Mhm,  packing - sexy cheerleader comedy."
74,Monica,"Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie."
75,Ross,What are you guys doing?
76,Joey,"Try it, I can't feel a thing!"
77,Joey,Monica
78,Chandler,We're taking a break!
79,Monica,From?
80,Chandler,Jumping on the bed?
81,Monica,"All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do."
82,Monica,"Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!"
83,Ross,You got it!
84,Ross,"All right, she's right, we gotta get serious."
85,Ross,Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!
86,Chandler,"No, no, no, guys."
87,Chandler,She's right.
88,Chandler,We should get to work.
89,Chandler,"I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs."
90,Joey,You guys hear a ringing?
91,Chandler,What the hell is this?
92,Joey,Hey!
93,Joey,Handcuffs!
94,Joey,"And fur line, nice!"
95,Joey,I didn't know you guys had it in ya!
96,Ross,"Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out."
97,Chandler,I didn't know Monica had these!
98,Joey,"Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend."
99,Joey,Maybe Richard!
100,Chandler,Why would she use them with Richard and not me?
101,Chandler,I can be kinky!
102,Chandler,I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
103,Ross,"Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard."
104,Phoebe,Hey!
105,Monica,Hey!
106,Monica,Where's Mike?
107,Phoebe,"Oh, he has a gig."
108,Phoebe,"I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know."
109,Phoebe,My husband has a gig.
110,Ross,Yeah?
111,Ross,"Yeah, where is it?"
112,Phoebe,"Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party."
113,Ross,Rock on!
114,Ross,Phoebe
115,Monica,"Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me!"
116,Monica,"So,"
117,Joey,Hey.
118,Chandler,Hey.
119,Ross,"Hey, where's Rach?"
120,Joey,"Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second."
121,Ross,Great.
122,Joey,"Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?"
123,Monica,Yeah.
124,Ross,Here she is!
125,Ross,Rachel
126,Joey,What did I just say?
127,Rachel,"No, no, no."
128,Rachel,It's ok.
129,Rachel,I'm gonna be fine.
130,Monica,"Come here, I'll make you a drink."
131,Ross,"Oh, man!"
132,Ross,I can't believe she's actually leaving.
133,Ross,How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
134,Chandler,"I know, she's been such a big part of my life."
135,Chandler,And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled.
136,Chandler,"I mean... oh, forget it."
137,Chandler,I miss Melrose Place!
138,Chandler,Joey
139,Ross,Yeah?
140,Joey,Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row?
141,Joey,"Head she wins, tails I lose."
142,Joey,Wait a minute...
143,Chandler,"Yes, Joe?"
144,Joey,I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!
145,Joey,Phoebe
146,Rachel,"Well, I've been better."
147,Phoebe,Uh-hmm.
148,Rachel,"You guys are gonna come and visit me, right?"
149,Phoebe,Yes!
150,Phoebe,"You know, in six months the Statute of Limitations runs out and I can travel internationally again!"
151,Rachel,I'm gonna miss you so much.
152,Phoebe,I know.
153,Rachel,You know what?
154,Rachel,"Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here ."
155,Ross,"Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?"
156,Joey,"Huh, if I had to  guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching."
157,Rachel,"Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start."
158,Phoebe,"Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents,   but I do have something for you."
159,Rachel,"Oh, oh."
160,Rachel,What is this?
161,Phoebe,"It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!"
162,Rachel,"I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!"
163,Monica,Chandler?
164,Monica,I was just in our bedroom and I found these  on my pillow.
165,Chandler,"Oh, yes."
166,Chandler,I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna  engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!
167,Monica,What are you talking about?
168,Monica,These aren't mine.
169,Chandler,"Oh yeah, right!"
170,Chandler,Good luck getting another scarf dance from  me!
171,Monica,That would be a terrible punishment.
172,Monica,"But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before."
173,Chandler,Really?
174,Chandler,Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
175,Monica,Rachel used to live in that room.
176,Chandler,Rachel... with handcuffs!
177,Chandler,Interesting!
178,Monica,Joey's bare ass!
179,Chandler,Well played.
180,Rachel,I love you Phoebe.
181,Phoebe,I love you too.
182,Phoebe,Please don't... Don't turn into... you know... French bitch!
183,Rachel,All right.
184,Rachel,"Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going."
185,Phoebe,Ok.
186,Rachel,Ok. Monica?
187,Monica,Yeah?
188,Rachel,Can you come here with me for a minute?
189,Monica,Sure.
190,Phoebe,Are you wearing waterproof mascara?
191,Monica,No.
192,Phoebe,"Oh, you're so screwed."
193,Ross,Hey.
194,Ross,What was that all about?
195,Phoebe,She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.
196,Ross,Are you kidding?
197,Ross,Oh my God...
198,Phoebe,"Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying."
199,Ross,"Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this."
200,Ross,Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year.
201,Ross,And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
202,Rachel,Mon...
203,Rachel,Okay...
204,Rachel,"I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you."
205,Rachel,No-one has been more like a sister to me...
206,Monica,I know what you mean.
207,Monica,You're like a sister to me too.
208,Rachel,I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...
209,Monica,You're the best friend I ever had.
210,Monica,What?
211,Rachel,I...
212,Rachel,I...
213,Rachel,I...
214,Monica,That is so sweet.
215,Ross,"Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family."
216,Ross,Oh God!
217,Ross,I could be next.
218,Ross,Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation.
219,Ross,"Oh, so that thing you said about the thing."
220,Ross,It really made me think about that other thing.
221,Chandler,"Uh, Rach?"
222,Ross,Well it's okay.
223,Ross,Chandler is talking to her.
224,Joey,I really made you think about that thing uh?
225,Chandler,"Uh, Rach..."
226,Chandler,I think I have something that belongs to you.
227,Rachel,"Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get."
228,Chandler,"No, no, no..."
229,Chandler,They're really yours.
230,Chandler,We... found them in your old room.
231,Rachel,"Well, these aren't mine."
232,Rachel,Maybe Monica used to use them with...
233,Chandler,Don't say Richard!
234,Chandler,"Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?"
235,Rachel,"Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room."
236,Chandler,Pheebs!
237,Phoebe,Yeah!
238,Chandler,I think these are yours.
239,Phoebe,"These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on!"
240,Phoebe,Good God!
241,Phoebe,"You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice."
242,Rachel,Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
243,Chandler,Sure.
244,Chandler,You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
245,Phoebe,Where do you think Mike really is?
246,Rachel,Oh honey...
247,Chandler,"Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke..."
248,Chandler,I just want to say that I...
249,Chandler,"I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you."
250,Chandler,And I'm so sad that you're leaving.
251,Rachel,"Oh, you know what?"
252,Rachel,Let's not say anything else.
253,Rachel,I love you.
254,Chandler,"Ooh, not so tight..."
255,Chandler,"I'm sorry, just give me one more chance."
256,Rachel,Okay.
257,Rachel,Oh...
258,Rachel,Oh!
259,Chandler,I'm sor... Just go.
260,Chandler,Just go.
261,Chandler,"I can't, I can't."
262,Monica,"So, I guess you're next."
263,Monica,You're ready?
264,Ross,I don't think so.
265,Chandler,"Oh, you're definately not."
266,Chandler,I haven't cried like that in years.
267,Monica,You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.
268,Chandler,That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
269,Ross,God!
270,Ross,I can't believe she saved me for last.
271,Ross,Why are they taking so long?
272,Phoebe,I don't know.
273,Phoebe,"But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well."
274,Ross,"Okay, here we go..."
275,Rachel,Oh...  Well...
276,Ross,Yeah...
277,Rachel,I think I'm gonna take off.
278,Ross,Huh?
279,Rachel,"Oh, you guys."
280,Rachel,This was an amazing night.
281,Rachel,Thank you so much.
282,Rachel,I love you.
283,Rachel,Good night.
284,Ross,What?
285,Ross,I don't get a goodbye?
286,Joey,Lucky bastard!
287,Ross,Unbelievable.
288,Ross,She says goodbye to everyone but me.
289,Monica,"Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit."
290,Ross,"Well, it needs to be plicit."
291,Joey,"All right, let's think about this."
292,Joey,"I mean, there's got to be an explanation."
293,Joey,Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?
294,Ross,"No, I don't think so."
295,Phoebe,"You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk."
296,Phoebe,It was pretty intense.
297,Monica,Yeah.
298,Monica,Mine too.
299,Chandler,Mine was a humdinger
300,Ross,O-kay...
301,Ross,"I mean, don't I deserve anything?"
302,Ross,"I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug?"
303,Ross,NOT FROM YOU!
304,Phoebe,"Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her."
305,Monica,And say what?
306,Monica,"""You owe me a goodbye"", I mean, he's got more pride than that."
307,Ross,THE HELL I DO!
308,Ross,I don't get a goodbye?
309,Rachel,What?
310,Ross,Everyone gets a goodbye but me?
311,Ross,"What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh?"
312,Ross,Be best friends with you?
313,Ross,"Uh, go out with you?"
314,Ross,Have a baby with you?
315,Ross,"Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things."
316,Rachel,Ross...
317,Ross,"Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit."
318,Ross,"Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people."
319,Ross,"Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good..."
320,Ross,IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.
321,Ross,You know what?
322,Ross,"After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us."
323,Ross,"Have a, have a good time in Paris."
324,Monica,I hope Ross isn't too upset.
325,Joey,I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.
326,Phoebe,Tell me about it.
327,Chandler,"Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party."
328,Phoebe,"All right, I think I'm gonna head out."
329,Monica,"Uh, where do you think you're going?"
330,Phoebe,"I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here."
331,Monica,We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do.
332,Monica,It would be great if you guys could pitch in.
333,Chandler,Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
334,Joey,"Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea."
335,Monica,Oh no!
336,Monica,You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.
337,Chandler,You couldn't be cool.
338,Monica,"Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen."
339,Monica,Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box.
340,Monica,The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped.
341,Monica,Got it?
342,Monica,Phoebe and
343,Joey,Yeah.
344,Monica,Good!
345,Monica,Now I need you to be careful and efficient.
346,Monica,"And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong."
347,Chandler,"Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are."
348,Monica,You did?
349,Monica,How?
350,Chandler,"Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used."
351,Monica,Oh my God!
352,Monica,Let me see.
353,Joey,Who's that dirty old lady?
354,Chandler,Monica's grandmother.
355,Monica,Nana liked it rough!
356,Joey,"Come on here, have a seat."
357,Phoebe,How was your night?
358,Monica,"Erica, are you okay?"
359,Monica,Oh my God!
360,Chandler,Relax!
361,Chandler,We just get her some antacids.
362,Monica,"She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor."
363,Chandler,Oh my God!
364,Phoebe,"Yeah, you got to get to the hospital."
365,Monica,"All right, Chandler get the coats."
366,Monica,Erica let's go.
367,Monica,"Phoebe and Joey, keep packing!"
368,Monica,Oh my God we're gonna have a baby.
369,Monica,All right.
370,Monica,We're gonna have a baby!
371,Monica,"OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY!"
372,Monica,"Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down."
373,Monica,Ooh!
374,Chandler,"Honey, it's gonna be okay."
375,Monica,"Okay, okay..."
376,Monica,"Okay, I feel a little better."
377,Monica,Oh...
378,Monica,"Yes, I'm sure."
379,Monica,"Oh honey, let's go."
380,Monica,Okay bye everyone.
381,Joey,"Chandler, wait, wait, wait..."
382,Chandler,What?
383,Joey,"If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger."
384,Rachel,You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?
385,Ross,That's what it seemed like.
386,Rachel,"I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me."
387,Ross,"Fine, then why didn't you say something?"
388,Rachel,Because it is too damn hard Ross.
389,Rachel,I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you.
390,Rachel,"When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go..."
391,Rachel,"Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong."
392,Rachel,It's because you mean more to me.
393,Rachel,"So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!"
394,Ross,Rach!
395,Rachel,What?
396,Ross,"You keep, you keep... You can't..."
397,Rachel,WHAT?
398,Rachel,COMMERCIAL BREAK
399,Joey,A little more.
400,Phoebe,Okay.
401,Joey,"A little more, a little more."
402,Joey,A little more... All right.
403,Joey,"Okay, all right, let's do this."
404,Phoebe,"All right, ready?"
405,Joey,Yeah.
406,Joey,"All right, now give me your best shot."
407,Phoebe,"All right, here it goes..."
408,Joey,Doesn't work...
409,Joey,THE END

14,Phoebe,"I get ""it's,"" ""and"" oh I'm sorry, I have ""A."""
15,Phoebe,Forget it.
16,Rachel,"Phoebe, come on that's silly."
17,Phoebe,"All right, so let's switch."
18,Rachel,"No, I have all of the good words."
19,Rachel,"OK, fine, fine, we can switch."

30,Phoebe,"Oh, you're no ordinary roommate are you?"
31,Rachel,"Phoebe, come on can we finish this later?"
32,Rachel,Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark.
33,Rachel,Oh!
34,Rachel,Why don't you come with me?
35,Phoebe,Really?
36,Rachel,"Yeah, it'll be fun."
37,Rachel,We'll run in the park.
38,Rachel,It'll be like our first y'know roommate bonding thing.
39,Phoebe,"Okay, let's go running!"
40,Rachel,Yeah and there's really cute guys there.
41,Phoebe,Let's run towards them!
42,Rachel,OK!
43,Phoebe,"All right, wait just one more second."
44,Phoebe,"Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's."
45,Phoebe,"Please leave a message, thanks!"
46,Rachel,Now wait a minute.
47,Rachel,You just took all the words!

51,Ross,"So, I just finished this fascinating book."
52,Ross,"By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain."
53,Ross,So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.
54,Chandler,And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
55,Monica,Hey!
56,Monica,Ross and
57,Chandler,Hey!
58,Monica,"Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!"

60,Monica,"Oh, So you can move them!"
61,Chandler,"Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you."
62,Joey,Hey everybody!
63,Joey,"Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine."
64,Joey,She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!
65,Ross,Hi!
66,Joey,"Yeah, she's gonna live with me!"
67,Monica,It's nice to meet you.

70,Joey,"Well, what a pretty last name!"
71,Chandler,"So, uh, wh-where ya from?"
72,Joey,From the land down under?

76,Joey,She-she's a dancer!
77,Joey,"Oh, hey let me."
78,Monica,"Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?"
79,Joey,Of course I did.
80,Monica,"Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?"
81,Joey,"""When can you move in?"""
82,Ross,Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
83,Chandler,Unbelievable
84,Monica,"Oh, so you like her too Chandler?"
85,Chandler,"Hey, look at all the boxes!"
86,Joey,"Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!"
87,Monica,Wait a minute...Joey.
88,Monica,"Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate."
89,Monica,It-it'll be way too complicated.
90,Ross,"Yeah, yeah man don't do it."
91,Ross,"I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her."
92,Chandler,"All right, think about it."
93,Chandler,Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up.
94,Chandler,Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
95,Joey,"Oh God, yeah."
96,Chandler,Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
97,Joey,Okay!
98,Chandler,No-no
99,Joey,"Oh, Oh, you're right!"
100,Joey,I don't want that.
101,Joey,I can't date her!
102,Monica,"Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble."
103,Joey,"Well, that's gonna be tough Mon."
104,Joey,I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
105,Monica,"Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt."
106,Joey,You a little sad about that sweetheart?
107,Joey,", The"
108,Phoebe,"I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up."

112,Phoebe,That's not running!
113,Phoebe,Let's go!
114,Phoebe,", Central"
115,Rachel,"You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man."
116,Ross,Monica had such a crush on him.
117,Ross,"Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed."
118,Rachel,Oh!
119,Rachel,I used to do that too!
120,Monica,"Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?"
121,Rachel,"Aw, Mon..."
122,Monica,"So, Phoebe runs weird huh?"
123,Rachel,"Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her."
124,Monica,Why don't you just be straight with her?
125,Monica,Tell her the truth.
126,Ross,Yeah.
127,Rachel,"You're right, you're right."
128,Rachel,I should just tell her the truth.
129,Phoebe,Hey!
130,Ross,Hey!
131,Rachel,"Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!"
132,Phoebe,Why?
133,Phoebe,Why would you do that?
134,Monica,I don't know.
135,Monica,Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
136,Rachel,Ankle.
137,Monica,We'll see.
138,Chandler,"OK, I'm officially unpacked."
139,Chandler,Thanks for helping me man.
140,Chandler,Joe?
141,Chandler,"Well, I guess Joey went home."
142,Chandler,"Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack."
143,Joey,I Gotcha!
144,Chandler,Oh my God!
145,Chandler,You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
146,Joey,"Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya."
147,Joey,"Hey, hey, the place looks great!"
148,Chandler,"Yeah, not bad right?"
149,Chandler,"You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless."
150,Chandler,"You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do?"
151,Chandler,"I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers."
152,Chandler,Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
153,Joey,I don't!
154,Joey,"No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer."
155,Chandler,"Yeah, now how's that going though?"
156,Chandler,Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
157,Joey,Yeah.
158,Joey,"Well, so far yeah."
159,Joey,But it's tough you know?
160,Joey,I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it.
161,Joey,How you doin?
162,Joey,Ohhhh man
163,Joey,"No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too."
164,Joey,Uh-uh nothing.
165,Joey,I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout.
166,Joey,I better hit the shower.
167,Joey,Oh my God!
168,Phoebe,Hi!
169,Phoebe,"Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me."
170,Phoebe,I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out.
171,Phoebe,You lied so you could run by yourself.
172,Rachel,"No, no Phoebe no, I was...no."
173,Rachel,"You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run."
174,Rachel,And I can!
175,Phoebe,"Please Rachel, I am not an idiot."
176,Rachel,"No, wait Phoebe."
177,Ross,"Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike."
178,Ross,"So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what cha doin?"
179,Chandler,What does it look like I'm doing?
180,Chandler,I am cleaning!
181,Ross,Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
182,Chandler,Authorization?
183,Chandler,I don't need that.
184,Chandler,I'm gonna put everything back.
185,Ross,Put it back exactly where you found it?
186,Chandler,Yes I'm gonna put it back  exactly where I found it.
187,Ross,"Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping."
188,Chandler,She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
189,Ross,"Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?"
190,Chandler,"She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it."
191,Ross,"Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well."
192,Ross,"Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me."
193,Chandler,"I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out."
194,Ross,"Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right."
195,Ross,"Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years."
196,Ross,She is going to freakout.
197,Ross,"Oh my God, she's going to sit on you."
198,Chandler,"No, she's not okay?"
199,Chandler,And I'll prove it to you.
200,Chandler,I'm gonna call her right now.
201,Chandler,Phone's done ehh.
202,Monica,Hi!
203,Chandler,"Hey Mon, how's it going?"
204,Monica,Terrible.
205,Monica,"If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself."
206,Monica,Other people just wreck stuff.
207,Monica,I really think I might kill someone tonight.
208,Chandler,"Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad."
209,Monica,It's worse.
210,Monica,The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon.
211,Monica,I think I may even try to get out of here early.
212,Chandler,No!
213,Chandler,No-no-no-no-no-no.
214,Chandler,It sounds like they really need you down there.
215,Monica,"Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?"
216,Chandler,"It's, all good!"
217,Chandler,Okay bye-bye Mon!
218,Chandler,She's-she's gonna kill me.
219,Ross,"Yeah, the phone was facing the other way."
220,Ross,And that goes back up there.
221,Ross,Commercial Break
222,Chandler,We should start with the big stuff.
223,Chandler,Y'know?
224,Chandler,That'll be the easiest.
225,Chandler,"Uh, let's start with the couch."
226,Chandler,I got it.
227,Ross,"Yeah that-that, doesn't look right."
228,Chandler,What are you talking about?
229,Chandler,The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet.
230,Chandler,"And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table."
231,Ross,"Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet."
232,Chandler,"OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch."
233,Ross,"Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area."
234,Chandler,"Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!"
235,Joey,"Look, what am I gonna do?"
236,Joey,"I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame!"
237,Joey,What the hell's going on over here?!?!?
238,Joey,Monica's gonna kill you!
239,Joey,"Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman!"
240,Joey,"Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time."
241,Ross,"Hey, I've been married 3 times"
242,Joey,"No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it."
243,Joey,What's your secret?
244,Ross,"Look, we do not repel women OK?"
245,Ross,That is completely untrue.
246,Chandler,"Oh no, yes we do my man."
247,Chandler,Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
248,Ross,"Yeah, well what about you?"
249,Ross,"You weren't you know, so hot in college either."
250,Ross,"After everything he said, he'd go ""ba dum bum chessh"""
251,Chandler,"Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that."
252,Ross,"Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science."
253,Chandler,That's not specific to girls.
254,Joey,"This is great, this is great, what else, what else?"
255,Ross,"Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar."
256,Chandler,And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
257,Ross,They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
258,Chandler,"Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica."
259,Ross,I'm never gonna find love again.
260,Rachel,"Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?"
261,Phoebe,Sure
262,Rachel,"Okay, um, I... All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry."
263,Rachel,OK?
264,Rachel,I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.
265,Phoebe,"So, what should you have done?"
266,Rachel,"Well, I-I should've told you the truth."
267,Phoebe,"Uh-Huh, Which is...?"
268,Rachel,"Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little..."
269,Phoebe,So?
270,Rachel,"Well, it's embarrassing."
271,Rachel,People were looking at us like we were crazy.
272,Phoebe,Why do you care?
273,Rachel,Because they're people.
274,Phoebe,But people that you don't know and will never see again.
275,Rachel,"Yes, but still."
276,Rachel,They're peoplewith eyes.
277,Phoebe,"Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss ."
278,Phoebe,"But no, okay."
279,Phoebe,"No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you."
280,Phoebe,"Yeah, okay."
281,Phoebe,You're uptight.
282,Rachel,I-I am not uptightHey-hey-hey-oh-oh!
283,Rachel,"Listen, I am not uptight, man."
284,Phoebe,That's okay Rachel.
285,Phoebe,I'm not judging you; that's just who you are.
286,Phoebe,Me.
287,Phoebe,I'm more free y'know?
288,Phoebe,"I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun."
289,Phoebe,"Y'know, I mean didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off?"
290,Phoebe,"Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan?"
291,Phoebe,The neighbor's dog.
292,Chandler,"Okay, is this lamp in the same place?"
293,Ross,Who cares?
294,Ross,I repel women.
295,Chandler,No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!!
296,Chandler,You can't come in here!
297,Chandler,R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
298,Monica,What?
299,Ross,What?
300,Chandler,I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
301,Ross,Why does anyone have to be naked?
302,Monica,Why is Ross naked?
303,Ross,I-I had to show Chandler something?
304,Monica,Naked?
305,Ross,"Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem."
306,Monica,Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
307,Chandler,"Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later."
308,Monica,"Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom."
309,Monica,Bye!
310,Chandler,Bye!
311,Chandler,Thank God
312,Ross,"Dude, what'd you have?"
313,Chandler,"Look, we have no time okay?"
314,Chandler,We must focus.
315,Chandler,We gotta get everything back into its original place.
316,Ross,The photo album!
317,Ross,There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album.
318,Ross,We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
319,Chandler,That's perfect!
320,Chandler,That's brilliant!
321,Ross,"So really, what'd ya have?"
322,Joey,"Uh, don't you mean ""for whom?"""
323,Joey,"Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh."
324,Joey,"All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay?"
325,Joey,You're hot.
326,Joey,I'm lovable.
327,Joey,Clearly there's a vibe going on between us.
328,Joey,"But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road."
329,Joey,"No, no, no, I'm telling ya."
330,Joey,Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay?
331,Joey,"So the question is, what do we do?"
332,Joey,Oh!
333,Joey,Oh!
334,Joey,I see what happened.
335,Joey,It's because I was trying to repel you.
336,Joey,Right?
337,Joey,"Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on."
338,Joey,"Oh, I do."
339,Joey,How you doin?
340,Joey,What?!?
341,Joey,Oh dear God!
342,Rachel,Hey!
343,Phoebe,Hey!
344,Rachel,"Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!"
345,Phoebe,See?
346,Phoebe,"And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!"
347,Rachel,Gone!
348,Rachel,I mean its amazing Pheebs.
349,Rachel,I feel so free and so graceful.
350,Rachel,Hey!
351,Rachel,Look out for the horse!
352,Rachel,Sorry!
353,Monica,Is it okay for me to come in now?
354,Chandler,Uh-huh
355,Monica,Why is everything different?
356,Ross,Bye!
357,Chandler,"No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it."
358,Monica,"Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets."
359,Chandler,"Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay?"
360,Chandler,"But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment."
361,Chandler,"So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
362,Monica,It's okay.
363,Monica,"Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?"
364,Chandler,Do you want me to be afraid of you?
365,Monica,Of course not.
366,Monica,"I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it."
367,Monica,"I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that."
368,Chandler,Really?
369,Monica,Of course!
370,Chandler,Oh well you're the best.
371,Chandler,You come here to me.
372,Monica,"All right, hold on okay?"
373,Monica,First thing's first.
374,Monica,"Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?"
375,Monica,Closing Credits
376,Ross,"So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain."
377,Ross,So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
378,Ross,"That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now?"
379,Ross,"You and I, we're interfacing."

11,Joey,"Now, I can have milk everyday."
12,Joey,Opening Credits
13,Chandler,"Well, it's official there are no good movies."
14,Monica,"Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this,  so that you can bunny bump against my back."
15,Joey,Hey!
16,Phoebe,Hey.
17,Chandler,"Hey, man."
18,Chandler,What's up?
19,Joey,Maybe you can tell me.
20,Joey,My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today.
21,Joey,The first good thing she gets me in weeks.
22,Joey,How could you not give me the message?
23,Chandler,"Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me."
24,Phoebe,"Yes, it was!"
25,Phoebe,It was him!
26,Phoebe,Uh huh!
27,Phoebe,"Okay, it was me!"
28,Joey,How is it you?
29,Phoebe,"Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know."
30,Phoebe,"I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet."
31,Phoebe,"I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand."
32,Phoebe,"See, all of it."
33,Joey,"Yep, that's my audition."
34,Monica,"See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere."
35,Phoebe,"Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play."
36,Joey,"Well, Estelle tried, you know."
37,Joey,The casting director told her that I missed my chance.
38,Phoebe,That is unfair.
39,Phoebe,I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
40,Joey,"Pheebs, you can't do that."
41,Joey,"The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents."
42,Phoebe,What a sad little life she must lead.
43,Phoebe,"Okay, ooh ."
44,Joey,"What, what are you doing?"
45,Joey,What are you doing?
46,Phoebe,"No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh."
47,Phoebe,"'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office."
48,Phoebe,"Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'"
49,Joey,"Hang up, hang up."
50,Phoebe,'Annie!
51,Phoebe,Hi.
52,Phoebe,"Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition."
53,Phoebe,Who did you speak to in my office?
54,Phoebe,"Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her."
55,Phoebe,No.
56,Phoebe,"All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'"
57,Chandler,Is anybody else scared?
58,Phoebe,"'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle."
59,Phoebe,I don't care!
60,Phoebe,"Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?'"
61,Phoebe,I need a pen.
62,Chandler,Get the woman a pad!
63,Chandler,Get the woman a pad!
64,Chandler,A pad!
65,Chandler,A pad!

71,Ross,"Why, why, why does he have it, again?"
72,Ross,You know what it's fine.
73,Ross,"If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I."
74,Ross,Give daddy the Barbi!
75,Ross,"Ben, give, give me the Barbi."
76,Ross,"Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck?"

82,Monica,Has anybody seen my left boob?
83,Joey,I love that movie.
84,Monica,There it is.
85,Monica,"Joey, what are you doing?"

89,Chandler,Answer the phone.
90,Joey,"Hey, I only got one good arm, you know."
91,Joey,You should be doing stuff for me.
92,Joey,Go get me a sweater.
93,Chandler,Just do it!
94,Chandler,"Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight."
95,Chandler,"Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight."
96,Rachel,What's the big deal?
97,Rachel,Why don't you wanna see Janice?
98,Chandler,"Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes."
99,Ross,"And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?"
100,Chandler,Noo.
101,Ross,"You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you."
102,Chandler,"No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple."
103,Chandler,And this alarm started going off in my
104,Rachel,Men are unbelievable.
105,Monica,What is it with you people!
106,Monica,"I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?"
107,Chandler,"I know, that,  that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid."
108,Monica,"Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you."
109,Joey,"Hey, you know about that?"
110,Chandler,Look what do I do?
111,Chandler,"I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing."
112,Chandler,"I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!"
113,Ross,Where there is no fear of commitment.
114,Chandler,Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
115,Joey,"Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right."
116,Joey,"But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear."
117,Joey,"It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building!"
118,Joey,If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.
119,Joey,Right.
120,Joey,"In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was."
121,Rachel,"Amazingly, that makes sense."
122,Chandler,You think?
123,Joey,"Oh, yeah."
124,Joey,"Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!"
125,Chandler,"Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way."
126,Phoebe,"Oh, it's your audition from this morning."
127,Phoebe,Can I use the phone again?
128,Rachel,"Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents."
129,Joey,"Come on baby, come on!"
130,Phoebe,"'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page."
131,Phoebe,"Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'"
132,Rachel,Very nice touch.
133,Phoebe,"'Okay, go ahead.'"
134,Phoebe,"Um, hi Annie."
135,Phoebe,Fantastic!
136,Phoebe,You got it.
137,Phoebe,"Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?'"
138,Phoebe,you ask me.
139,Phoebe,"Well, I don't know about that,  except that I do and he will."
140,Phoebe,"Great, oh you are such a sweetheart."
141,Phoebe,"I would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next.... Op, went through a tunnel."
142,Rachel,Unbelievable.
143,Joey,Thank you so much.
144,Phoebe,"It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before."
145,Joey,"You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in."
146,Phoebe,"Oh, I don't know."
147,Phoebe,I mean it was fun one time.
148,Joey,"Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two."
149,Phoebe,Two?
150,Joey,Yeah!
151,Joey,"Well, well really it's three."
152,Joey,Please.
153,Joey,You're so good at it.
154,Joey,I love you.
155,Phoebe,"Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right"
156,Joey,"Nooo, four."
157,Chandler,"'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this."
158,Chandler,"Well, wait there's, there's more."
159,Chandler,See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer.
160,Chandler,"See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser."
161,Chandler,"Yes, I did."
162,Chandler,"Yes, I did."
163,Chandler,"Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get."
164,Chandler,"Well, not me."
165,Chandler,"But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more."
166,Chandler,We should take a trip.
167,Chandler,"Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do."
168,Chandler,"And, I wanna meet your parents."
169,Chandler,We should take a trip with your parents!
170,Chandler,"I am, I actually am."
171,Chandler,I mean this is amazing.
172,Chandler,"My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal."
173,Chandler,I could probably say 'Let's move in together.'
174,Chandler,and I'd be okay.
175,Chandler,It doesn't scare me!
176,Chandler,"Oh, no, no, no, don't go!"
177,Chandler,I've scared ya'!
178,Chandler,I've said too much!
179,Chandler,"I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!!"
180,Chandler,"Hey, Janice!"
181,Chandler,It's me.
182,Chandler,"Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street."
183,Chandler,Commercial Break
184,Rachel,"Honey, this will help."
185,Chandler,"So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down."
186,Chandler,Rachel and
187,Monica,Uff.
188,Monica,That is never good.
189,Chandler,Then I got all needy and clingy.
190,Rachel,"Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute."
191,Rachel,Maybe it's not so bad.
192,Rachel,How did you leave it?
193,Chandler,She said she'd call me.
194,Chandler,Rachel and
195,Monica,Ohh!
196,Chandler,Oh God.
197,Monica,Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
198,Chandler,This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
199,Rachel,"Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk."
200,Rachel,"We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases."
201,Monica,"You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat."
202,Rachel,"Yeah, you do."
203,Chandler,"So, you don't think I'm terminal?"
204,Monica,"Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control."
205,Chandler,"Okay, okay."
206,Chandler,"So, should I call her?"
207,Chandler,Rachel and
208,Monica,Nooo!
209,Rachel,This is a very critical time right now.
210,Rachel,"If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath."
211,Rachel,You want her back you have to start acting aloof.
212,Monica,She has to know that your not ready.
213,Rachel,Right.
214,Rachel,"So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose."
215,Rachel,And then act aloof.
216,Chandler,"So I'm not, not gonna lose her?"
217,Rachel,"Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser."
218,Chandler,"I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'"
219,Rachel,Oh.
220,Ross,Guess who's here.
221,Ross,"It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben."
222,Ross,'A real American hero.

251,Phoebe,"Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
252,Joey,"It's okay, these things happen."
253,Phoebe,"But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business."
254,Phoebe,"Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that."
255,Joey,"I'm, I'm okay."

257,Phoebe,"Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh."
258,Phoebe,"You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit."
259,Joey,No!
260,Joey,"No, no you can't quit!"
261,Joey,You're the best agent I ever had!
262,Joey,"Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally."
263,Phoebe,"Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent."
264,Joey,They actually said that?
265,Phoebe,Yeah.
266,Phoebe,"Ooh God, there's that face again!"
267,Phoebe,See I can't do this job!
268,Phoebe,I...
269,Joey,"No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie."
270,Joey,"You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this."
271,Joey,I canna work on a new accent.
272,Phoebe,"Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay."
273,Phoebe,Yeah.
274,Ross,"You'll never get me, Joe!!"
275,Chandler,"Hello, Janice."
276,Chandler,"Oh, just a bit of shopping."
277,Chandler,How've you been?
278,Chandler,No.
279,Chandler,Not anymore.
280,Chandler,"Yeah, huh."
281,Chandler,"I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party."
282,Chandler,"Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours."

287,Phoebe,"Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on."
288,Joey,"Okay, shoot."
289,Phoebe,"Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial."
290,Joey,I didn't get it?
291,Phoebe,No.
292,Phoebe,They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.'
293,Phoebe,"So, you can work on that."
294,Joey,"Okay, what else?"
295,Phoebe,"Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'"
296,Joey,Oh.
297,Phoebe,"Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'"
298,Joey,"Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle."
299,Phoebe,Oh.
300,Joey,"Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out."
301,Phoebe,"Yeah, no, I understand."
302,Joey,"You do, thanks."
303,Phoebe,Yeah.
304,Phoebe,Sorry.
305,Joey,Wait a minute.
306,Phoebe,What?
307,Joey,"Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent."
308,Phoebe,"Oh, you caught me."
309,Phoebe,I am so busted.
310,Joey,That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
311,Chandler,"....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store."
312,Monica,My God!
313,Monica,"Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'."
314,Chandler,I've actually ruined this haven't I?
315,Chandler,"It's time for the good ice cream now, right?"
316,Rachel,"Yeah, it is."
317,Monica,"You know what, everything's gonna be okay."
318,Chandler,Hello.
319,Chandler,"Hi, Janice!"
320,Chandler,Can you hold on for a second?
321,Chandler,Okay.
322,Chandler,"Okay, what do I do?"
323,Rachel,"Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented."
324,Monica,If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
325,Rachel,Yeah.
326,Chandler,Hello!
327,Monica,"Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off."
328,Monica,Be sleepy.
329,Rachel,"Yes, and grumpy."
330,Chandler,"What are you, stop naming dwarves!"
331,Chandler,"Hello, Janice."
332,Chandler,"Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately."
333,Chandler,"And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times."
334,Chandler,I'm sorry.
335,Chandler,Really?!
336,Chandler,Really?
337,Rachel,"He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now."
338,Chandler,I love you too.
339,Monica,"Aw, it's soo unfair."
340,Ross,"Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose."
341,Ross,"Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out."
342,Ross,"And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'"
343,Monica,What are you being such a weenie for?
344,Monica,"So he has a Barbi, big deal."
345,Monica,You used to dress up like a woman.
346,Ross,What?
347,Monica,"Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time."
348,Ross,What are you talking about?
349,Monica,"The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag."
350,Ross,"Okay, you are totally making this up."
351,Monica,How can you not remember?
352,Monica,You made us call you...Bea.
353,Ross,Oh God.
354,Monica,Wasn't there a little song?

6,Phoebe,"She's made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen."
7,Joey,"Well all right then, I guess I shouldn't get to excited about the fact  that I just kissed her!"
8,Monica,You serious?

37,Rachel,Monica look!
38,Rachel,Look-look-look!
39,Rachel,Here is that table that I ordered.
40,Monica,You got it from Pottery Barn?
41,Rachel,Yeah!
42,Rachel,It's an apothecary table.
43,Rachel,Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
44,Chandler,A pharmacist.
45,Monica,"Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn."
46,Joey,I hate Pottery Barn too.
47,Joey,They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!
48,Chandler,You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
49,Joey,I was tired!
50,Rachel,Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?
51,Monica,"Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff."
52,Monica,"She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it."
53,Rachel,Well this has story behind it!
54,Rachel,I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
55,Monica,It's gotta be one of a kind.
56,Monica,"Y'know like umm, y'know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?"
57,Joey,Hey!
58,Joey,I made that for her!
59,Chandler,You made pottery?
60,Joey,Yeah!
61,Joey,I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
62,Monica,I'm tellingIf you put that in her apartment you'll never hear the end of it.
63,Rachel,Okay fine!
64,Rachel,"I'll-I'll just tell her it's an antique apothecary table, she doesn't have to know where it came from."
65,Rachel,Oh!
66,Rachel,Look at this little drawers!
67,Rachel,Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
68,Chandler,"Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore"
69,Chandler,"so then the farmer says, ""That's not a cow and you're not milking it."""
70,Monica,"I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!"
71,Chandler,"Look at us, we're a couple of couples!"

88,Joey,Blah?
89,Joey,"Uh, they're like my best friends."
90,Joey,Are you saying we can't hang out with them?
91,Joey,Cause that would kinda be a problem.
92,Joey,I guess.
93,Joey,"If you want, I'll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents."
94,Phoebe,Hey!
95,Rachel,Hey!
96,Phoebe,"Ooh, what a great table!"
97,Phoebe,Where-where did you get it?
98,Rachel,Guess!
99,Phoebe,"Umm, a flea market?"
100,Rachel,Ha!
101,Rachel,"See, I knew, I knew you'd get it on the first guess."
102,Rachel,Isn't it cool!
103,Rachel,It's an apothecary table.
104,Phoebe,Wow!
105,Phoebe,Oh you can just imagine that this is where  they kept all the stuff to make their potions.
106,Rachel,"Ohh, yes."
107,Phoebe,Y'know?
108,Phoebe,"Ooh, you can almost smell the opium."
109,Rachel,Almost.
110,Phoebe,How much was it?
111,Rachel,It was only 500 bucks.
112,Phoebe,500 bucks at a flea market?
113,Rachel,"Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y'know like back then."
114,Phoebe,Oh no.
115,Rachel,"Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y'know, it was like a dollar."
116,Phoebe,A dollar?
117,Rachel,And fifty.
118,Rachel,So it was like one and fifty dollars.
119,Phoebe,"Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing."
120,Rachel,Yeah.
121,Phoebe,"Well, what period is it from?"
122,Rachel,"Uh, it's from yore."
123,Rachel,Like the days of yore.
124,Rachel,Y'know?
125,Phoebe,"Yes, yes I do."
126,Phoebe,"God, oh it's just perfect!"

130,Phoebe,Like y'know where it was from or
131,Rachel,Yes!
132,Rachel,"That I know, this is from White Plains."
133,Phoebe,White Plains.
134,Phoebe,"Oh, it sounds like such a magical place."
135,Rachel,Hey!
136,Rachel,We're here!
137,Ross,Hey!
138,Rachel,Ohh!
139,Rachel,Oh my God!
140,Ross,You like it?
141,Rachel,Oh no!
142,Ross,It's my new apothecary table!
143,Rachel,Ross!
144,Rachel,"Phoebe's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!"
145,Ross,Well why not?!
146,Ross,She'll-she'll love it!
147,Ross,It's the real thing!
148,Ross,I got it at Pottery Barn.
149,Rachel,I know you did!
150,Rachel,I bought the same one!
151,Rachel,And if she sees your table she's gonna know that I lied to her.
152,Rachel,I told her ours was an original.
153,Ross,Why did you do that?
154,Rachel,Because she hates Pottery Barn.
155,Ross,She hates Pottery Barn?!
156,Rachel,I know!
157,Rachel,"I know, she says it's all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff."
158,Rachel,"So come on, she's gonna be here any second!"
159,Rachel,Can we please just cover this up with something?!
160,Rachel,Please?
161,Ross,What?
162,Ross,No!
163,Ross,No!
164,Ross,"I am not gonna hide it from PhoebeOoh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!"
165,Rachel,Ooo!
166,Rachel,"Oh, I forgot they made sheets!"
167,Ross,"Uh, yeah!"
168,Ross,I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn!
169,Rachel,"Ross, get over it!"
170,Rachel,It's not like she hates you.
171,Ross,Yeah but Pottery Barn!
172,Ross,Y'know what I think?
173,Ross,It's just she-she's weird.
174,Ross,Y'know it's because she's a twin.
175,Ross,Twins are weird.
176,Rachel,"Ross, she's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind."
177,Ross,Huh.
178,Ross,Y'know what's not one of a kind?
179,Ross,A twin!
180,Phoebe,Hey!
181,Rachel,Hey!
182,Ross,Hey!
183,Rachel,"Ooh, Phoebe's here!"
184,Rachel,"Okay, let's turn out all the lights and we'll just watch the movie!"
185,Phoebe,Okay.
186,Phoebe,"HeyOoh, cool sheets!"
187,Ross,"Oh, you like it?"
188,Ross,You wanna know where I got it?
189,Phoebe,Sure!
190,Rachel,He got it a flea market!
191,Phoebe,You bought your sheets at a flea market?
192,Phoebe,"Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little."
193,Monica,Hey!
194,Joey,Hi!
195,Monica,The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes.
196,Monica,This is so exciting.
197,Chandler,And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight.
198,Chandler,"You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn't afford it, because you paid dinner last night."
199,Joey,Thanks.
200,Joey,"Thanks, but uh actually it's just gonna be me again tonight."
201,Monica,What happened to Janine?
202,Joey,"Oh, she's uh-uh really sick."
203,Chandler,Oh that's too bad.
204,Joey,"Yeah, she's been in there all day , uh high fever, a nose problem Phlegm!"
205,Joey,Phlegm!
206,Joey,Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!
207,Joey,Kay!
208,Chandler,"That's funny, I saw no phlegm."
209,Chandler,Commercial Break
210,Joey,"No-no, she really is sick!"
211,Chandler,Then why-why is she going to a play?
212,Joey,"Uh, y'know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold."
213,Monica,Joey!
214,Monica,Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?
215,Joey,"Well uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row."
216,Joey,I'm so sorry.
217,Chandler,"Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?"
218,Joey,"Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud."
219,Monica,What?!!
220,Monica,What?
221,Chandler,So she was just pretending to have a good time last night?
222,Chandler,She was lying to our faces?
223,Monica,"Ugh, I can not believe this!"
224,Monica,"I mean, who is she to judge us?"
225,Monica,We could not have been nicer to her!
226,Chandler,"And I am not blah, I am a hoot!"
227,Joey,I know!
228,Joey,I know!
229,Joey,"Come on, please-please you guys, don't-don't be mad."
230,Joey,"I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends!"
231,Joey,Y'know?
232,Joey,And it was our first date!
233,Joey,"Plus, she's really sick!"
234,Chandler,"No, you shNo you said you made that up!"
235,Joey,"I know, but don't you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?"
236,Chandler,"Eh, they're both good."
237,Chandler,"I generally just go with, Monica's drunk again."
238,Joey,"Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh?"
239,Joey,She'll come around I promise.
240,Monica,"Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner."
241,Chandler,Okay.
242,Monica,I do not like that woman!
243,Joey,I can hear you!
244,Monica,I am loud!
245,Rachel,That's funny.
246,Ross,"Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my newold sheet?"
247,Phoebe,Oh sure!
248,Phoebe,Noo!
249,Rachel,Ohh!
250,Ross,My apothecary table!!
251,Phoebe,What?
252,Rachel,Noooooo!
253,Phoebe,"Ross, where did you get this?"
254,Ross,I got it at Pottery Barn!!
255,Ross,Okay?
256,Rachel,"Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!"
257,Phoebe,Wow!
258,Phoebe,"Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!"
259,Rachel,Oh yes.
260,Phoebe,Well this doesn't even smell like opium.
261,Ross,"Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled!"
262,Ross,And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
263,Phoebe,"Oh Ross, calm down, I'll give you the 80 cents."
264,Chandler,"Okay, one more time."
265,Monica,"Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?"
266,Chandler,Perfect decibel.
267,Monica,I know!!
268,Joey,Hey!
269,Chandler,Hey.
270,Joey,"So uh, what are you guys doing?"
271,Chandler,"Oh nothing, we're just talking."
272,Chandler,"Y'know, blah-blah-blah."
273,Joey,"Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try!"
274,Joey,"All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine."
275,Monica,"Well, I'd like to but,  I'm not sure we have time to go."
276,Joey,"Ha-ha, very funnyLook!"
277,Joey,I don't know what to do!
278,Joey,I really want you guys to get along.
279,Joey,Just please come to the movie with us.
280,Joey,I mean you owe me!
281,Monica,We owe you?
282,Joey,That's right!
283,Joey,I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship.
284,Joey,Huh?
285,Joey,"I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot!"
286,Joey,And I was humiliated.
287,Joey,And I only made 200 dollars!
288,Monica,We didn't give you any money!
289,Joey,You don't think I know that!
290,Rachel,"see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table."
291,Ross,Wow!
292,Ross,I didn't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
293,Rachel,"I know, I know."
294,Rachel,I went a little crazy.
295,Ross,A little?
296,Ross,Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue.
297,Ross,Oh look at that!
298,Ross,The ornamental bird cage!
299,Ross,Large!
300,Phoebe,Hey!
301,Rachel,Hey.
302,Phoebe,Oh Ross no.
303,Phoebe,"Be careful, that is very old!"
304,Phoebe,Okay?
305,Phoebe,Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
306,Ross,Fascinating.
307,Phoebe,Another amazing find!
308,Phoebe,Wow!
309,Phoebe,Oh I bet this has a great story too!
310,Rachel,"Oh it does, it does!"
311,Rachel,It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.
312,Phoebe,Ah!
313,Ross,"Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times."
314,Ross,"Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel?"
315,Rachel,Well there's yore.
316,Rachel,"And uh, y'know, yesteryear."
317,Phoebe,"Yeah no, I'm telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff."
318,Phoebe,"Ross, y'know if you ever decide you need to redecorateAnd I think that you should."
319,Phoebe,"You should, you should ask Rachel to help."
320,Rachel,Oh honey he doesn't need my help.
321,Phoebe,"Oh, come on!"
322,Phoebe,"I think he's ready to get rid of, what did you call it?"
323,Phoebe,The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
324,Ross,Really?!
325,Ross,"Hey, y'know what?"
326,Ross,"Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here's-here's 60 bucks, why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff."
327,Rachel,Y'know what?
328,Rachel,"I don't, I don't think Phoebe really wants to come."
329,Phoebe,No!
330,Phoebe,I do want to!
331,Rachel,"Oh, she does want to."
332,Ross,She does want to.
333,Phoebe,Yeah!
334,Rachel,"Pheebs, I don't know what to say."
335,Rachel,I guess the flea market was just better last time.
336,Phoebe,Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.
337,Rachel,Yeah.
338,Phoebe,"Uck, look at this!"
339,Phoebe,"Pottery Barn, yuck!"
340,Rachel,"Yeah, y'know what?"
341,Rachel,Don't look at it.
342,Rachel,"Seriously, don't look at it."
343,Phoebe,No!
344,Phoebe,Look-look!
345,Phoebe,There's the coffee table they stole from us!
346,Rachel,"Ugh, those bastards!"
347,Rachel,Let's go.
348,Phoebe,That fan kinda looks like ours.
349,Phoebe,And the birdcage and thewait a sec!
350,Phoebe,This is our exact living room!
351,Rachel,No!
352,Rachel,No!
353,Rachel,No!
354,Rachel,No it's not!
355,Rachel,No it's not!
356,Rachel,Come on!
357,Rachel,"Phoebe, ours is totally different!"
358,Rachel,I mean we don't have the  We don't have thethat lamp!
359,Rachel,"And-and that screen is y'know, on the other side."
360,Phoebe,Oh my God.
361,Phoebe,"This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn!"
362,Phoebe,Oh my God!
363,Rachel,Okay!
364,Rachel,"Okay-okay lookno I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn."
365,Rachel,Just Come on don't be mad.
366,Phoebe,"No-no-no, but I am mad!"
367,Phoebe,I am mad!
368,Phoebe,Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world!
369,Phoebe,And it's all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!
370,Rachel,"Well then honey, buy the lamp!"
371,Rachel,"Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross."
372,Phoebe,I can't!
373,Phoebe,I can't!
374,Phoebe,Unless Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn't buy that lamp?
375,Rachel,What?!
376,Rachel,No!
377,Rachel,I'm not gonna move out!
378,Phoebe,But are you saying that you would move out if I didn't buy that lamp?
379,Rachel,Oh.
380,Rachel,Yes!
381,Rachel,I would so move out!
382,Phoebe,Okay then I don't have a choice!
383,Phoebe,I have to buy that lamp!
384,Rachel,That's right!
385,Phoebe,But at least the apothecary table is real.
386,Joey,"Well, this-this-this was great."
387,Joey,Didn't everybody have a great time?
388,Chandler,That's totally understandable.
389,Monica,Don't worry about it.
390,Chandler,Oh yeah!
391,Monica,Absolutely!
392,Joey,"Oh well then, good night!"
393,Monica,Good night!
394,Joey,See?
395,Joey,"Eh, wasn't that fun?"
396,Monica,I knew it!!
397,Monica,"Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!"
398,Chandler,And I'm blah?
399,Chandler,"Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it,  ""Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."""
400,Monica,All right!
401,Monica,You and me!
402,Monica,Let's go!
403,Monica,Right now!
404,Joey,All right!
405,Joey,All right!
406,Joey,Enough!
407,Joey,Enough!
408,Joey,Enough!!
409,Joey,Enough!
410,Joey,You two go home!
411,Joey,I-I-I gotta talk to Janine!
412,Chandler,Y'know I think you can take her.
413,Monica,You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!
414,Joey,"All right, uh, we've got a little bit of a problem here."
415,Joey,These people are my friends; you can't treat them that way.
416,Joey,I know!
417,Joey,I know!
418,Joey,And I'm going to talk to them about it.
419,Joey,They mean so much to me.
420,Joey,They They're like my family.
421,Joey,"If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I I don't think we can be together."
422,Joey,"It just, it just can't work."
423,Joey,It can't.
424,Joey,I'm very upset.
425,Joey,Yeah!
426,Joey,Yeah!
427,Joey,That would be very helpful!
428,Joey,Yeah.
429,Monica,What did I tell you about the hall?
430,Monica,"Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too."
431,Monica,Now come on.
432,Monica,"Well, I'm glad we worked things out."
433,Monica,Okay.
434,Monica,Bye.
435,Monica,That's it big girl!
436,Monica,Come on!
437,Monica,You'd better run!
438,Chandler,Did you hear that?
439,Joey,"Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?"
440,Chandler,"Yeah, I'm sorry man."
441,Chandler,You wanna go watch?
442,Joey,Yeah!
443,Joey,Ending Credits
444,Ross,Hey!
445,Joey,How ya doin'?
446,Chandler,"Hey so, did uh, did she move out?"
447,Joey,"Pretty much, yeah."

449,Joey,"Well, when it's not right, you know it."
450,Chandler,You okay?
451,Joey,Yeah!
452,Joey,Yeah.
453,Joey,I'll be all right.
454,Ross,Y'know what would cheer you up?
455,Joey,What?
456,Ross,"I'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come."
457,Joey,You're right!
458,Joey,That did cheer me up!
459,Joey,End
0,Chandler,"Hey, you guys!"
1,Chandler,Ross and
2,Rachel,Hey!
3,Chandler,"So, what do you think?"
4,Ross,About what?
5,Rachel,"Yeah, what?"
6,Joey,What?
7,Chandler,Are you kidding?
8,Chandler,"Okay, I'll give you a hint; I'll give you a hint."
9,Joey,Eyes!
10,Joey,"No, no."
11,Joey,Your eyes!
12,Joey,No.
13,Joey,Chandler's eyes!
14,Chandler,I got glasses!
15,Ross,"Well, you-you've always had glasses."
16,Chandler,No I didn't!
17,Ross,Are you sure?
18,Rachel,"Yeah-yeah, did-didn't you use to have a pair?"
19,Rachel,"They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm"
20,Joey,Feminine.
21,Rachel,Yes!
22,Chandler,No!
23,Monica,"Sweetie, I think the glasses look great."
24,Monica,They make you look really sexy.
25,Chandler,Really?
26,Monica,Yeah!
27,Chandler,"You didn't think I used to wear glasses, right?"
28,Monica,Of course!
29,Monica,Opening Credits
30,Phoebe,So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
31,Chandler,"That's okay Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything, so you don't have to get us"
32,Monica,"If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy."
33,Rachel,"Oh, y'know what you should get em?"
34,Rachel,"One of those little uh, portable CD players."
35,Monica,"Oh, I already have one."
36,Phoebe,Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
37,Rachel,"Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey."
38,Monica,"Hey, I know I what I want!"
39,Chandler,What we want honey.
40,Monica,"No, you don't want this."
41,Monica,I want to have your grandmother's cookie recipe.
42,Phoebe,You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
43,Monica,"Uh-huh, yeah."
44,Phoebe,You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?
45,Chandler,Dying people say the craziest things.
46,Monica,I wanted it for years!
47,Monica,I was gonna make cookies for my children.
48,Phoebe,"Break my heartOh, all right."
49,Monica,Okay.
50,Monica,I'm gonna be the mom that makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.
51,Chandler,Our kids are gonna be fat aren't they.
52,Joey,Ahoy!
53,Chandler,Hey!
54,Chandler,How's the boat?
55,Joey,Great!
56,Joey,I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
57,Monica,"Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?"
58,Joey,Why would I do that?
59,Joey,It took three guys to get the thing in there!
60,Phoebe,"If you don't sail your boat, what do you do on it?"
61,Joey,"Oh, it's great!"
62,Joey,"It's a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips."
63,Chandler,"Well, it's good that you finally have a place to do that."
64,Rachel,"Y'know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want."
65,Joey,You could?
66,Rachel,Yeah!
67,Rachel,I've been sailing my whole life.
68,Rachel,When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
69,Phoebe,Your own boat?
70,Rachel,What?!
71,Rachel,What?!
72,Rachel,He was trying to cheer me up!
73,Rachel,My pony was sick.
74,Chandler,Do you know what I was thinkin'?
75,Monica,What?
76,Chandler,"Nothing, I just like to go like this."
77,Ross,"Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?"
78,Chandler,"Uh why, do you have a lecture?"
79,Ross,"No, why?"
80,Chandler,Then free as a bird.
81,Chandler,What's up?
82,Ross,My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
83,Monica,Wow!
84,Monica,That's great!
85,Monica,"Dad must really like you, he doesn't ask just anyone to play."
86,Ross,"Yeah and he didn't really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you."
87,Chandler,"Well, did-did you correct him?"
88,Ross,"No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way."
89,Monica,"This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week."
90,Ross,Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans.
91,Ross,He does that every week too.
92,Monica,"Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win."
93,Ross,Yeah.
94,Monica,He hates to lose.
95,Chandler,"Oh no problem, maybe I'll play with my left hand."
96,Ross,You're not a lefty?
97,Chandler,Does anybody know me?
98,Monica,What's wrong Phoebe?
99,Phoebe,I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
100,Monica,No!!
101,Monica,Why didn't you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!
102,Phoebe,Because I'm normal!
103,Phoebe,"That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present."
104,Ross,"Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?"
105,Chandler,Don't worry about it Pheebs.
106,Ross,No one got me an engagement present.
107,Phoebe,"Okay, here I wish you health and happiness."
108,Chandler,An old cookie?
109,Monica,This is what happens when you don't register for gifts!
110,Phoebe,"See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left."
111,Chandler,We can't accept this.
112,Phoebe,Why not?
113,Chandler,Cause it's gross.
114,Monica,No!
115,Monica,Wait!
116,Monica,I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie!
117,Monica,I do stuff like this at work all the time.
118,Phoebe,Really?
119,Monica,Yeah!
120,Monica,I bet I can do it.
121,Chandler,"Okay, we owe you a present."
122,Ross,Two!
123,Ross,I've been engaged twice!
124,Joey,Look at this clown!
125,Joey,Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river.
126,Joey,Get out of the way jackass!
127,Joey,Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
128,Rachel,That is the Coast Guard.
129,Joey,What are they doing out here?
130,Joey,The coast's all the way over there.
131,Rachel,"Joey, just ignore the boats all right?"
132,Rachel,We're not finished with the lesson yet.
133,Joey,All right.
134,Rachel,"Okay, I'm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?"
135,Joey,"Come on Rach, not again."
136,Joey,I got it!
137,Joey,Okay?
138,Joey,"Let's start sailing, and I want to go over there  where that boatload of girls is!"
139,Joey,Yo-ho-ho!
140,Rachel,"Oh, okay."
141,Rachel,Is that what you want to do?
142,Rachel,"You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas?"
143,Rachel,"Okay, let's do that Sailor Joe."
144,Rachel,"Quick question though,  what's this called?"
145,Joey,"Uh, boat rope."
146,Rachel,Wrong!
147,Rachel,How do you get the mainsail up?
148,Joey,"Uhh, rub it?"
149,Rachel,No.
150,Rachel,What do you do if I say we are coming about?
151,Joey,"I'd say, come again."
152,Joey,"No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh"
153,Rachel,"Time's up, now your dead."
154,Joey,And deaf!
155,Rachel,"Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea."
156,Rachel,Am I getting through to you sailor?
157,Joey,Yes.
158,Rachel,Don't just say yes!
159,Rachel,"This isn't a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here."
160,Rachel,"Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?"
161,Joey,I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
162,Monica,"All right, I definitely taste nutmeg."
163,Phoebe,You do?
164,Monica,You don't?
165,Monica,"Well, that's the difference between a professional and a layman."
166,Phoebe,That and arrogance.
167,Joey,Hey.
168,Monica,Hey!
169,Monica,How was sailing?
170,Joey,I don't want to talk about it.
171,Joey,"Y'know, you could've at least saved me a whole cookie."
172,Joey,Monica and
173,Phoebe,No-wait-no-no!!!!!!
174,Joey,Women are mean!!
175,Phoebe,I can't believe that!
176,Phoebe,Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is this crumb.
177,Phoebe,I wish you a long and happy marriage.
178,Ross,Hey.
179,Monica,Hey!
180,Monica,How was it?
181,Ross,Well I had a great time!
182,Ross,"Umm, Chancy on the other hand"
183,Chandler,I will tell the story!
184,Chandler,It was going great.
185,Chandler,I let him win.
186,Chandler,We were bonding.
187,Chandler,He even said I could call him dad.
188,Ross,And what did he ask you not to call him?
189,Chandler,Daddy.
190,Chandler,"All right look, here's the story."
191,Chandler,"Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam."
192,Chandler,I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy.
193,Chandler,So I take off my glasses and that's when in happened.
194,Chandler,Guys?
195,Ross,Over here.
196,Ross,Mr.
197,Monica,Oh my God Chandler!
198,Monica,I can't believe it!
199,Chandler,I know.
200,Monica,You gave my father a lap dance!
201,Chandler,Why do they put so much steam in there?
202,Ross,Cause otherwise they'd have to call it the room room.
203,Chandler,Why?
204,Chandler,Okay?
205,Chandler,Why?
206,Chandler,Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
207,Phoebe,"Come on, it's not that big a deal!"
208,Chandler,Not that big a deal?
209,Chandler,Therethere was touching of things.
210,Ross,"Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?"
211,Monica,"Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care."
212,Monica,He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!
213,Chandler,I don't want him to tell this story for years.
214,Ross,"Oh, but he will."
215,Ross,He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
216,Monica,I wasn't escaping.
217,Ross,Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
218,Monica,I was trying to help out a squirrel.
219,Ross,You were trying to eat it!
220,Chandler,If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
221,Monica,Come on.
222,Monica,Hello?
223,Monica,I'm sorry you have the wrong number.
224,Monica,"Okay, I'll call you later dad."
225,Monica,I love you.
226,Chandler,"All right, I'm off to see your dad."
227,Ross,"Whoa-whoa, aren't you a little over dressed?"
228,Rachel,"Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time."
229,Chandler,"Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to faceAnd by face I don't mean his lap."
230,Chandler,"And by face, I don't mean my ass."
231,Ross,Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
232,Rachel,I don't know.
233,Rachel,"Y'know, they didn't get us anything."
234,Ross,Thank you!
235,Joey,Hey.
236,Ross,Hey.
237,Rachel,Well hello!
238,Rachel,"So, when are we gettin' back out on the water matey?"
239,Joey,"Oh uh, I don't know the boat way to say this, but uh never!"
240,Rachel,Why not?
241,Joey,Because!
242,Joey,You're mean on the boat!
243,Rachel,What?
244,Rachel,I was just trying to teach you.
245,Joey,"Well, lesson learned!"
246,Joey,Rachel is mean!
247,Ross,Yeeeeeep Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep.
248,Ross,I remember when she took out on her dad's boat she wouldn't let me help at all.
249,Rachel,"Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets."
250,Ross,You have to respect the sea!
251,Rachel,"Look Joey, I'm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something."
252,Rachel,That was not mean.
253,Rachel,"Okay, my father is mean."
254,Rachel,"He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible."
255,Rachel,I was just being a good teacher.
256,Joey,"Does a good teacher say, ""Put down the beer pinhead!?"""
257,Rachel,"Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?"
258,Joey,Six and a half!
259,Joey,You knocked that last one out of my hand!
260,Joey,Remember?
261,Rachel,"Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!"
262,Joey,Well it hit me anyway!
263,Joey,And it would've hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
264,Rachel,"All right, y'know what?"
265,Rachel,I-I'm sorry.
266,Rachel,I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.
267,Joey,You won't boss me around anymore?
268,Rachel,I won't boss you around.
269,Joey,And you'll be nice?
270,Rachel,"And, I'll be nice."
271,Joey,And you'll be topless?
272,Rachel,AndJoey!
273,Joey,Do you want me to learn?
274,Monica,"Okay, here's batch 22."
275,Monica,"Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's."
276,Monica,"This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg."
277,Ross,Let's give it a shot.
278,Monica,Okay.
279,Monica,"Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade."
280,Phoebe,"Oh, what was that for?"
281,Phoebe,Like a bake sale?
282,Monica,"No, just a Friday night."
283,Ross,"Ohh, these are pretty good."
284,Phoebe,"Yeah, but not as good as batch 17."
285,Ross,Which one was that?
286,Monica,The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
287,Ross,Oh yeah!
288,Ross,Batch 17 was good.
289,Ross,I did not like batch 16.
290,Ross,I'm okay.
291,Phoebe,Are there anymore from the good batch?
292,Phoebe,Cause we could just work off of those.
293,Ross,"Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh  It's batch 16!"
294,Ross,16 people!
295,Ross,Get out of the way!
296,Rachel,"Okay Joey honey, you're doing really good!"
297,Rachel,"All right, now I'm just gonna need you to step to the port side."
298,Rachel,Remember?
299,Rachel,Remember how we talked about the port side?
300,Joey,Ohh yeah.
301,Rachel,Right?
302,Joey,Nope.
303,Rachel,"It's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one."
304,Joey,I don't know why you just don't say left.
305,Rachel,"Okay, go to the left."
306,Rachel,The left!
307,Joey,Huh?
308,Rachel,Just sit over there!
309,Joey,Okay!
310,Joey,"Okay, you're yelling again!"
311,Joey,See that?
312,Rachel,No!
313,Rachel,"No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling."
314,Joey,"Oh, y'know what?"
315,Joey,"Since I'm here, I think I'm gonna have me a little beer on the port side."
316,Rachel,"Okay Joey, we're luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?"
317,Joey,"Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there."
318,Rachel,"Joey, come on!"
319,Rachel,We just went over this!
320,Joey,"Oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth."
321,Joey,Did you see it?
322,Joey,It was gross!
323,Rachel,No!
324,Rachel,All right?!
325,Rachel,I did not see the bird!
326,Rachel,I did not see the fish!
327,Rachel,I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson!
328,Rachel,"I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat!"
329,Rachel,Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
330,Joey,All right that's it!
331,Joey,You're yelling and I don't see you taking your top off!
332,Joey,I quit!
333,Rachel,What do you mean you quit?!
334,Rachel,You can't quit!
335,Joey,Why not?
336,Rachel,Because you're not finished yet and I won't have it!
337,Rachel,Greens do not quit!
338,Joey,Greens?
339,Joey,I'm a Tribbiani!
340,Joey,And Tribbianis quit!
341,Rachel,"Oh my God, wait did II just said Greens don't quit didn't I?"
342,Rachel,Did I just say Greens don't quit?
343,Joey,Yes!
344,Joey,Yes!
345,Joey,You did and you're still yelling at me!
346,Rachel,No!
347,Rachel,No!
348,Rachel,No!
349,Rachel,"I'm not yelling at you, I'm just yelling near you."
350,Rachel,"Oh God Joey, ohh I'm my father."
351,Rachel,"Oh my God, this is horrible!"
352,Rachel,I've been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin'.
353,Rachel,"Oh, Joey, I'm sorry."
354,Rachel,I'm so sorry.
355,Rachel,I just wanted you to learn.
356,Joey,"Well, hey I did learn."
357,Rachel,Really?
358,Joey,Yeah!
359,Joey,Come on.
360,Rachel,Awww
361,Joey,"Yeah, it's okay."
362,Joey,I know what a mainsail is.
363,Joey,"I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across."
364,Joey,I-I know port is right.
365,Rachel,Left.
366,Joey,Damnit!
367,Phoebe,"Y'know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe."
368,Phoebe,I bet she's l-l-lookin' up at us and smiling right now.
369,Ross,Looking up?
370,Phoebe,"Oh yeahNo, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure."
371,Monica,"Well, I've tried everything."
372,Monica,I give up.
373,Monica,I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies.
374,Monica,I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe.
375,Monica,Kids love that right.
376,Ross,"Aww, Pheeb, come on isn't there any relative that would have the recipe?"
377,Ross,"What about, what about your sister?"
378,Phoebe,"Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body."
379,Phoebe,"And that's not happening til October 15th, 2032."
380,Ross,That's the day you're gonna die?
381,Ross,"Seedarnit, I've got shuffleboard that day."
382,Phoebe,That's what you think.
383,Monica,"Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's?"
384,Monica,Wouldn't they have the recipe?
385,Phoebe,"Well, y'know I may have relatives in France who would know."
386,Phoebe,"My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse."
387,Monica,What was her name?
388,Phoebe,Nesele Toulouse.
389,Monica,Nestle Tollhouse?
390,Phoebe,"Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language."
391,Monica,"Phoebe, is this the recipe?"
392,Phoebe,Yes!!
393,Phoebe,Ohh.
394,Monica,I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
395,Phoebe,I know!
396,Phoebe,You see it is stuff like this which is why  you're burning in hell!
397,Chandler,"So you understand, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you didn't tell people what happened."
398,Chandler,"Y'know, I'm a littleI'm a little embarrassed about it."
399,Chandler,Mr.
400,Chandler,What did you do when they found out?
401,Chandler,Mr.
402,Chandler,So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
403,Chandler,Ending Credits
404,Rachel,"Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun."
405,Joey,"Yeah, yeah."
406,Joey,"Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope?"
407,Rachel,Ohh we're not sailing.
408,Joey,Just pull on it.
409,Rachel,All right.
410,Rachel,Hey-hey-hey!!
411,Rachel,Sandwiches!
412,Joey,What else?
413,Rachel,Here you go.
414,Joey,Thank you.
415,Rachel,Oh wow!
416,Joey,What are you doing?
417,Rachel,"Ohh, sorry."
418,Joey,What youdon't hold it like that!
419,Joey,You're lettin' all the good stuff fall out.
420,Rachel,Ohh whoops.
421,Joey,Careful!
422,Joey,You're wasting good pastrami!
423,Joey,Oh my God!
424,Joey,I'm my dad!
425,Joey,End
0,Joey,Man this is weird.
1,Joey,You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?
2,Chandler,That's what's weird?
3,Chandler,"Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years."
4,Chandler,Waaa-aaah.
5,Joey,What?
6,Chandler,The spoon.
7,Chandler,You licked and-and you put.
8,Chandler,You licked and you put.
9,Joey,"Yeah, so."
10,Chandler,Well don't you see how gross that is?
11,Chandler,I mean that's like you using my toothbrush.
12,Chandler,You used my toothbrush?
13,Joey,"Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain."
14,Chandler,Mine is the red one!
15,Chandler,Oh God.
16,Chandler,"Can open, worms everywhere."
17,Joey,"Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?"
18,Chandler,Because soap is soap.
19,Chandler,It's self-cleaning.
20,Joey,"Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash."
21,Joey,OPENING TITLES
22,Chandler,Hey.
23,Chandler,MONICA and

29,Joey,He's havin' a brunch.
30,Phoebe,Ahh.
31,Rachel,"OK, ready when you are."
32,Phoebe,Okey-doke.
33,Monica,I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.
34,Chandler,"Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?"
35,Rachel,"Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him."
36,Joey,"Wow, this is wild."
37,Joey,What're you gonna get?
38,Phoebe,"Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom."
39,Phoebe,'Cause her name's Lily.
40,Chandler,"Wow, that's lucky."
41,Chandler,What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?
42,Joey,So where you gettin' it?
43,Phoebe,I think on my shoulder.
44,Ross,What?
45,Ross,What's on your shoulder?
46,Phoebe,"Um, a chip."
47,Phoebe,"A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo."
48,Ross,A tattoo?
49,Ross,"Why, why would you want to do that?"
50,Ross,Hi.
51,Rachel,Hi.
52,Rachel,"Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?"
53,Ross,"No, sorry I don't."
54,Ross,Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life?
55,Ross,What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe?
56,Ross,"Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time."
57,Ross,Why's everyone staring at me?
58,Monica,"Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad."
59,Monica,Rich is gonna be here any minute.
60,Chandler,"Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?"
61,Monica,"Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there."
62,Joey,"Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?"
63,Monica,Yeah.
64,Monica,"It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke."
65,Phoebe,"No, I think you should tell them."
66,Monica,"No, I don't even know how serious he is about me."
67,Monica,"Until I do, I'm not telling them anything."
68,Ross,"I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind."
69,Ross,"Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'"
70,Ross,"Alright, shall we?"
71,Monica,"OK, wait, wait, wait, wait."
72,Monica,You know what?
73,Monica,"Ross, let's - let's switch places."
74,Monica,You get in the middle.
75,Monica,"No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up."
76,Ross,"Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it."
77,Ross,We're here.
78,Ross,MRS.
79,Monica,Happy birthday dad.
80,Monica,MR.
81,Ross,Hi ma.
82,Ross,"Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us."

84,Monica,"Oh God, sorry."
85,Monica,"Here, let me get that mom."
86,Monica,MRS.
87,Monica,Are we still on that?
88,Monica,MRS.
89,Joey,Can you believe this place?
90,Chandler,"I know, this is a great apartment."
91,Joey,"Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you."
92,Joey,So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.
93,Chandler,"Wow, there's my fantasy come true."
94,Chandler,"No, seriously."
95,Chandler,JOEY'S CO-STAR
96,Joey,Hey!

105,Chandler,OK.
106,Ross,"Dad, you really don't want to do that."
107,Ross,MR.
108,Ross,"Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence."
109,Ross,MR.
110,Phoebe,"OK Rach, which, which lily?"
111,Phoebe,This lily or that lily?
112,Rachel,Well I. .
113,Phoebe,I like this lily.

115,Phoebe,"She had a more open, giving spirit."
116,Phoebe,"Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh."
117,Phoebe,TATTOO
118,Phoebe,Here we go.
119,Rachel,Uh-huh.
120,Phoebe,You're not going?
121,Rachel,Uh-huh.
122,Phoebe,What?
123,Phoebe,Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?
124,Rachel,No.
125,Rachel,"Well, yeah, maybe."
126,Phoebe,I don't believe this.
127,Phoebe,Is this how this relationship's gonna work?
128,Phoebe,Ross equals boss.
129,Phoebe,"I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?"
130,Rachel,What's 1922?
131,Phoebe,"Just, you know, long time ago."
132,Phoebe,"Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot."
133,Phoebe,"And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible."
134,Phoebe,Do you want to get this tattoo?
135,Rachel,"Yes I do, it's just that Ross is."
136,Phoebe,"OK, hey, HEY."
137,Phoebe,Is your boyfriend the boss of you?
138,Rachel,No.
139,Phoebe,"OK, who is the boss of you?!"
140,Rachel,You?
141,Phoebe,No.
142,Phoebe,You are the boss of you.
143,Phoebe,Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip.
144,Phoebe,GO!
145,Monica,I'm a twinkie.
146,Monica,"Oh, this is so hard."
147,Monica,Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
148,Monica,"God, you are so lucky."
149,Monica,"I mean, I mean."
150,Monica,you know what I mean.
151,Monica,Alright.
152,Joey,Can we drop this?
153,Joey,I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
154,Chandler,"Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings."
155,Chandler,You want it.
156,Joey,"Why would I want another apartment, huh?"
157,Joey,I've already got an apartment that I love.
158,Chandler,Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
159,Joey,"Alright, you want the truth?"
160,Joey,I'm thinkin' about it.
161,Chandler,What?
162,Joey,I'm sorry.
163,Joey,"I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore."
164,Chandler,"Woah, woah, woah."
165,Chandler,"I don't need a roommate either, OK?"
166,Chandler,I can afford to live here by myself.
167,Chandler,"Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware."
168,Joey,"What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh?"
169,Joey,It's not like we agreed to live together forever.
170,Joey,We're not Bert and Ernie.
171,Chandler,"Look, you know what?"
172,Chandler,"If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it."
173,Joey,Well that's how I feel.
174,Chandler,Well then maybe you should take it.
175,Joey,Well then maybe I will.
176,Chandler,Fine with me.
177,Joey,Great.
178,Joey,"Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons."
179,Ross,"Mon, Mon, are you OK?"
180,Monica,You remember that video I found of mom and dad?
181,Ross,Yeah.
182,Monica,"Well, I just caught the live show."
183,Ross,Eww.
184,Monica,Hey there.
185,Monica,"Nothing, I just heard something nice about you."
186,Monica,"Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone."
187,Monica,MRS.
188,Ross,Ohh.
189,Ross,MRS.
190,Ross,"Mom, there are so many people in my life."
191,Ross,Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't.
192,Ross,Is that crystal?
193,Ross,MRS.
194,Monica,"Well, uh, he's a doctor."
195,Monica,MRS.
196,Monica,"No, a doctor of meat."
197,Monica,Of course he's a real doctor.
198,Monica,"And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him."
199,Monica,MRS.
200,Monica,"Mom, it's OK."
201,Ross,I'll take that dad.
202,Ross,MRS.
203,Monica,"Dad, I'm the twinkie."
204,Monica,MR.
205,Monica,"Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in."
206,Monica,MRS.
207,Monica,"Yes, a relationship."
208,Monica,For your information I am crazy about this man.
209,Monica,Yes.
210,Monica,MR.
211,Monica,"Dad, dad this is a good thing for me."
212,Monica,"Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier."
213,Monica,MR.
214,Monica,Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.
215,Phoebe,"Oh that looks so good, oh I love it."
216,Rachel,"I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this."
217,Rachel,"OK, lemme se yours."
218,Phoebe,Ahh.
219,Phoebe,"OK, let's see yours again."
220,Rachel,"Phoebe we just saw mine, let me see yours."
221,Phoebe,"Oh OK.  Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went."
222,Rachel,You didn't get it?
223,Phoebe,No.
224,Rachel,Why didn't you get it?
225,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
226,Rachel,"Phoebe, how would you do this to me?"
227,Rachel,This was all your idea.
228,Phoebe,"I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?"
229,Rachel,Really?
230,Rachel,"You don't say, because mine was licked on by kittens."
231,Joey,Hey.
232,Chandler,Hey.
233,Joey,"Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened."
234,Chandler,Yeah me too.
235,Joey,I know.
236,Joey,Yeah.
237,Chandler,Yeah.
238,Chandler,So do we need to hug here or.
239,Joey,"No, we're alright."
240,Chandler,So I got ya something.
241,Joey,Plastic spoons.
242,Joey,Great.
243,Chandler,Lick away my man.
244,Joey,These'll go great in my new place.
245,Joey,"You know, 'till I get real ones."
246,Chandler,What?

250,Joey,I'm movin' out like we talked about.
251,Chandler,Well I didn't think that was serious.

81,Phoebe,But like a really tough one that shots bad guys.
82,Phoebe,"Ohh, I just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?!"
83,Phoebe,You just like can't keep your hands off each other.
84,Monica,I know it is the best.

94,Monica,All right?!
95,Monica,Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!
96,Phoebe,"God, I woke the beast."
97,Phoebe,Sorry.
98,Phoebe,"I was wrong obviously, I justI misspoke."

101,Monica,"I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!"
102,Chandler,"Hey Monica, here's your broom back."

109,Chandler,So what happened?
110,Rachel,"Ugh, it was horrible!"
111,Rachel,"And-and the interview part went so well, y'know?"
112,Rachel,I even made him laugh.
113,Rachel,"He said something about a boat and I was like, ""Well, yeah!"
114,Rachel,"If you've got enough life jackets!"""
115,Rachel,"Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny."
116,Rachel,"Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!"
117,Joey,What happened?

128,Rachel,"What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?"
129,Joey,Yeah!
130,Joey,No?
131,Monica,A kiss?
132,Monica,What are you talking about?
133,Rachel,"I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause ""Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"""
134,Chandler,"Come on, Rach."
135,Rachel,Oh my God!
136,Rachel,What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
137,Monica,He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
138,Rachel,Maybe.
139,Rachel,"I-I don't knowOh God, how could I be so stupid?"
140,Joey,"Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey."

181,Rachel,"Now even though I , hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me."
182,Rachel,"I do not want, this job that bad."

184,Rachel,"Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!"

200,Phoebe,You're not?
201,Phoebe,Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?

244,Monica,Huh?
245,Monica,No one is hotter than we are!
246,Monica,You're the best.
247,Chandler,"No, you're the best."
248,Monica,"No, you're the best."
249,Chandler,"No, you're the best."

251,Joey,Hey guys!
252,Joey,What 'cha been doin'?
253,Monica,Hey Joey!
254,Monica,Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
255,Joey,I don't know.
256,Joey,But I can see through your sheet.
257,Joey,"Yeah, yeah, that's her."
258,Joey,But y'know what?
259,Joey,"Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway."
260,Monica,Why?
261,Joey,Because it's impossible to find her apartment!
262,Joey,"She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something."
263,Monica,What are you talking about?
264,Monica,"She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!"
265,Joey,No.
266,Joey,No.
267,Joey,No.
268,Joey,"She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left."
269,Monica,"No, those first two windows,  that's the lobby."
270,Monica,"And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway."
271,Monica,You've been counting wrong.
272,Joey,I did not know that!
273,Joey,Thank you Monica.
274,Joey,I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
275,Ross,"So uhh, you ready?"
276,Ross,Sure.
277,Ross,Joey
278,Joey,Dahhhhh!!
279,Joey,No!

281,Rachel,"Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again."
282,Rachel,Mr.
283,Rachel,Okay.
284,Rachel,"Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you."
285,Rachel,Mr.
286,Rachel,"Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah,  who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why."
287,Rachel,"I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage."
288,Rachel,"When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no."
289,Rachel,That shows integrity.
290,Rachel,"And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage."
291,Rachel,"Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage."
292,Rachel,"And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious."
293,Rachel,"{By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against."
294,Rachel,So she didn't want to sue him.
295,Rachel,"Don't worry, I had to look it up too.}"
296,Rachel,"So there you go, you got, you got  courage, you got integrity, you got  courage again, and not litigious."
297,Rachel,Look Mr Mr.
298,Rachel,Zelner!
299,Rachel,Right!
300,Rachel,I knew that!
301,Rachel,"I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it."
302,Rachel,Mr.
303,Rachel,Oh!
304,Rachel,You are?
305,Rachel,Mr.
306,Rachel,Really?
307,Rachel,Oh thank you!
308,Rachel,"Oh Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?"
309,Rachel,Mr.
310,Rachel,"Okay, well then how about a handshake?"
311,Rachel,Oh God I'm sorry!
312,Rachel,"Oh God, I'm sorry!"
313,Rachel,I did not mean to touch thatI mean you there.
314,Rachel,There.
315,Rachel,"Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you soHey!"
316,Rachel,I'll see you Monday!
317,Phoebe,You tired Chandler?
318,Monica,"You better believe he's tired, after the day we had!"
319,Monica,If you know what I mean.
320,Monica,You know what I mean?
321,Chandler,"Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean."
322,Chandler,"Oh yeah, it's so cool."
323,Chandler,"Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100."
324,Chandler,That's pee-pee.
325,Monica,"Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair."
326,Phoebe,"Ohh,  umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here."
327,Monica,You didn't!
328,Phoebe,We did!
329,Phoebe,We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!
330,Monica,The park huh?
331,Monica,A public place.
332,Monica,I hear ya.
333,Monica,Excuse me for just a second!
334,Monica,Hi Chandler.
335,Chandler,Monica!
336,Chandler,This is the Men's room!
337,Chandler,Isn't it?
338,Monica,Yes it is.
339,Monica,You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual.
340,Monica,Haven't you?
341,Chandler,No.
342,Chandler,"And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out."
343,Chandler,"Monica, this is getting ridiculous!"
344,Monica,"Come on, we can't let them win!"
345,Chandler,"Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot!"
346,Chandler,Okay?
347,Chandler,So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?
348,Monica,Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
349,Chandler,So?
350,Monica,I feel really sad that we're notreally there anymore.
351,Chandler,Oh wow!
352,Chandler,Is that what this all have been about?
353,Monica,Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
354,Chandler,Yeah that was great.
355,Chandler,That was really great!
356,Chandler,"But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now."
357,Monica,Really?
358,Chandler,Yeah!
359,Chandler,I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before.
360,Chandler,"Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible."
361,Chandler,"And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting."
362,Monica,That is so sweet.
363,Monica,"I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way."
364,Chandler,Yeah?
365,Monica,Yeah.
366,Chandler,Y'know what I just realized?
367,Chandler,You just freaked out about our relationship.

46,Ross,"Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room."
47,Phoebe,Yay!
48,Phoebe,It's so exciting!
49,Phoebe,"Wow, you could've done that with us there."
50,Ross,Yeah right.
51,Phoebe,"Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can't talk to Rachel."
52,Ross,What?!
53,Ross,When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?
54,Phoebe,Oh please!
55,Phoebe,Just before when you were asleep in the lounge!
56,Phoebe,That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV.
57,Phoebe,"Oh, that reminds me."
58,Phoebe,That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.
59,Joey,"Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?"
60,Chandler,Sure.
61,Joey,Dude I just did something terrible.
62,Chandler,That was you?!
63,Chandler,I thought it was Jack!
64,Joey,No!
65,Joey,"No, that was Jack!"
66,Joey,Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!
67,Chandler,What?!
68,Chandler,Why does she think that?
69,Joey,Because it kinda looked like I did.
70,Chandler,"Again, what?"
71,Joey,"Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand"
72,Chandler,As we all are at some point during the day.
73,Joey,It wasn't my ring!
74,Joey,It fell out of Ross's jacket!
75,Joey,And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!
76,Chandler,Ross had a ring?!
77,Chandler,And he was gonna propose?
78,Joey,I guess.
79,Chandler,And you did it first?!
80,Chandler,This is gonna kill him!
81,Chandler,You know how much he loves to propose!
82,Joey,I know!
83,Joey,I know it's awful.
84,Chandler,"Well, what did she say?"
85,Joey,She said yes.
86,Chandler,Does Ross know?
87,Joey,"Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?"
88,Chandler,Well maybe you don't have to tell him anything.
89,Joey,"Oh, I like that."
90,Joey,Yeah
91,Chandler,"If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!"
92,Joey,Now let's not get carried away.
93,Monica,I want a baby.
94,Chandler,"Honey, we've been over this."
95,Chandler,I need to be facing the other way.
96,Monica,Come on!
97,Monica,"Come on, if we have sex again it'll double our chances of getting pregnant."
98,Monica,Do you think that closet's still available?
99,Chandler,I'm so tired.
100,Chandler,"Yeah okay, but no foreplay."
101,Monica,Deal!
102,Ross,Dad seriously!
103,Ross,Y'know you really should see someone about that!
104,Ross,Mr.
105,Ross,"I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?"
106,Ross,Mr.
107,Ross,Actually umm
108,Phoebe,Hey!
109,Rachel,Hi.
110,Phoebe,Are you all right?
111,Rachel,Uhh I think I just got engaged.
112,Phoebe,Oh my God!
113,Phoebe,He did it?
114,Rachel,Welldid you know he was gonna ask me?
115,Phoebe,Are you kidding?
116,Phoebe,I'm like the one who talked him into it.
117,Phoebe,I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
118,Rachel,And you really think this is a good idea?
119,Phoebe,"I just talked him into it, don't tell me I have to do you too."
120,Phoebe,The puppet master gets tired people.
121,Rachel,I just don't know!
122,Rachel,It just doesn't feel right.
123,Phoebe,Why?!
124,Phoebe,"You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so."
125,Rachel,Really?!
126,Rachel,Even Ross?
127,Phoebe,Especially Ross!
128,Joey,"Oh uh, hey Pheebs."
129,Joey,Uh y'know what?
130,Joey,I'll-I'll come back later.
131,Ross,Wow!
132,Ross,"Kind of uh, kind of a full house here."
133,Ross,I'll guess justI'll come back.
134,Phoebe,"There he goes, your fiancée."
135,Rachel,I guess so.
136,Phoebe,Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
137,Rachel,I can't say that I'm surprised.
138,Ross,"Dad, what are you doing?"
139,Ross,Mr.
140,Joey,"It can't be me, I'm standing right here."
141,Joey,Mr.
142,Ross,No!
143,Ross,Mr.
144,Ross,Y'know what?
145,Ross,I don't like you without mom.
146,Ross,Come on.
147,Joey,We're not peeking?
148,Joey,Mr.
149,Chandler,"Hello sir, you know Monica."
150,Joey,"Hey uh, is it okay to come in?"
151,Rachel,Of course!
152,Rachel,"Oh Joey, this ring Iit's beautiful I love it!"
153,Joey,"Yeah uh look Rach, there's something I gotta tell ya."
154,Rachel,Hey!
155,Rachel,Yeah!
156,Rachel,Hi Emma.
157,Rachel,"Hey, why do you think she won't take my breast?"
158,Joey,Yowsa!
159,Rachel,"Okay sweetie, you can do it."
160,Rachel,Just open up and put it in your mouth.
161,Joey,Dear Lord.
162,Rachel,"I'm sorry honey, what were you saying?"
163,Joey,"Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that"
164,Rachel,"Oh look, she's pulling away again!"
165,Rachel,Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth?
166,Rachel,She looks scared.
167,Rachel,Doesn't she look scared?
168,Joey,"Y'know, I don't really know her."
169,Joey,Are you kidding me?
170,Rachel,It's just so frustrating!
171,Rachel,Why doesn't she want my breast?
172,Joey,I don't know!
173,Joey,Maybe she's crazy!
174,Phoebe,Oh hey!
175,Phoebe,Wait up!
176,Ross,Hi!
177,Phoebe,Congratulations!
178,Phoebe,I didn't want to say anything in front of Joey cause I didn't know if he knew yet.
179,Ross,"What, that we had a baby?"
180,Ross,"Come on let's give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier."
181,Phoebe,No!
182,Phoebe,"No, that you and Rachel are engaged!"
183,Ross,What?
184,Phoebe,"Oh, it's a secret."
185,Phoebe,Oh goodie!
186,Phoebe,Yes!
187,Phoebe,We haven't done the secret thing in a long time.
188,Ross,"Phoebe, there is no secret."
189,Ross,Okay?
190,Ross,I didn't propose.
191,Phoebe,Are you lying?
192,Phoebe,Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?
193,Ross,I am a doctor!
194,Ross,Y'know what?
195,Ross,I'm just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.
196,Phoebe,"All right, me too."
197,Phoebe,Should we wake her up?
198,Ross,No!
199,Ross,"No, come on let her sleep!"
200,Ross,She's so exhausted.
201,Phoebe,And so engaged.
202,Ross,What?
203,Ross,Oh my God!
204,Ross,She-she thinks we're engaged!
205,Ross,Why?
206,Ross,Why?
207,Ross,Why would she think we're engaged?
208,Phoebe,Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring?
209,Phoebe,Y'know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.
210,Ross,I didn't give her that ring!
211,Phoebe,Really?
212,Ross,No!
213,Phoebe,So whose ring is it?
214,Ross,It's mine.
215,Phoebe,Is it an engagement ring?
216,Ross,Yes!
217,Phoebe,But you didn't give it to her?
218,Ross,No!
219,Phoebe,But you were going to propose?
220,Ross,No!
221,Phoebe,"Huh, I might be losing interest in this."
222,Ross,Look.
223,Ross,"Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybekindawanted ahstartthings up again."
224,Phoebe,"Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment."
225,Ross,"Look, I didn't want to rush into anything."
226,Ross,And it seemed like she didn't want to either.
227,Ross,"But I don't, I don't understand how any of this happened!"
228,Ross,What?
229,Ross,"Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?"
230,Phoebe,No!
231,Phoebe,"No, she said you actually proposed to her."
232,Ross,Well I didn't!
233,Ross,I didn't propose!
234,Ross,Unless uh  Did I?
235,Ross,I haven't slept in forty hours andit does sound like something I would do.
236,Ross,Commercial Break
237,Chandler,"Look, we can't stay in here forever."
238,Monica,"Oh, I still can't believe my dad saw us having sex!"
239,Monica,"He didn't make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!"
240,Chandler,This is okay.
241,Chandler,We're all adults here; there's nothing to be ashamed of.
242,Chandler,"Now, let's put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door."
243,Monica,Hi Dad!
244,Monica,I can still call you that right?
245,Monica,Mr.
246,Chandler,"I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun."
247,Monica,It wasn't fun?
248,Chandler,Why?
249,Chandler,"Why-why-would youWh-why  Look, I just don't want you to think that we're animals who do it whenever we want."
250,Chandler,Mr.
251,Monica,"The truth is, Dad, we're-we're trying."
252,Monica,Mr.
253,Monica,"Yeah, we're trying to get pregnant."
254,Monica,Mr.
255,Monica,"Well, that's okay dad, we-we can wait until later."
256,Monica,Mr.
257,Monica,Daddy?!
258,Monica,Mr.
259,Chandler,"That's funny, this conversation's how I got the bullet hole in my head."
260,Chandler,Mr.
261,Monica,Daddy!
262,Monica,I don't think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.
263,Monica,Mr.
264,Monica,I don't feel good right now.
265,Monica,Mr.
266,Chandler,"Seriously sir, my brains?"
267,Chandler,All over the wall.
268,Monica,Hey.
269,Rachel,Hey.
270,Rachel,I need to tell you something.
271,Monica,"Well, now's a good time."
272,Monica,I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.
273,Rachel,Joey asked me marry him.
274,Monica,What?
275,Rachel,Joey proposed to me.
276,Monica,Is he crazy?!
277,Monica,You just had Ross's baby!
278,Rachel,"Well, I-I said yes."
279,Monica,What?!
280,Monica,Are you crazy?
281,Monica,You just had Ross's baby!
282,Monica,It's-it's so inappropriate.
283,Monica,"No, it's worse than that."
284,Monica,It's wrong.
285,Monica,It's It is bigger than mine!
286,Rachel,I know.
287,Rachel,"Days of Our Lives, thank you very much."
288,Monica,You can't marry him!
289,Rachel,Why not?
290,Rachel,I don't want to do this alone!
291,Rachel,And he's such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.
292,Monica,Well do you love him?
293,Rachel,Sure.
294,Monica,Sure?
295,Rachel,"Yeah, I mean whatever."
296,Monica,"Honey, the question isdo you really want to marry Joey?"
297,Rachel,No.
298,Rachel,"No, I don't."
299,Rachel,Could you be a dear and go tell him?
300,Chandler,You still haven't told Rachel you weren't really proposing?
301,Joey,No!
302,Joey,"She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out."
303,Chandler,"Joey, you have to tell her what's going on!"
304,Chandler,And what did it look like?
305,Joey,I didn't look at it.
306,Joey,Stupid baby's head was blocking most of it.
307,Chandler,Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
308,Joey,"Look, it's not that easy."
309,Joey,She said she wanted to marry me.
310,Joey,I don't want to hurt her.
311,Chandler,"Okay, look, just do it gently."
312,Joey,You're right.
313,Joey,You're right.
314,Joey,I-I'll go tell her now before Ross finds out and I'll be gentle.
315,Joey,I can do that.
316,Joey,I am a gentle person.
317,Joey,"Oh, by the way."
318,Joey,Two people screwing in there  if you want to check that out.
319,Ross,Hey.
320,Rachel,Hey.
321,Ross,"Listen, I um I heard about the engagement."
322,Rachel,Surprised?
323,Ross,And confused.
324,Ross,"Rach, sweetie, I-I umI didn't propose to you."
325,Rachel,I know.
326,Ross,I don't think you do.
327,Rachel,You didn't propose to me.
328,Rachel,Joey did.
329,Ross,"Poor baby, you're so tired."
330,Ross,"Rach, I didn't propose to you, Joey didn't propose to you, and Chandler didn't propose to you."
331,Rachel,"Uh You didn't propose to me, Chandler didn't propose to me, but Joey did."
332,Ross,Joey proposed to you?
333,Joey,I can come back.
334,Ross,"Hey, wait!"
335,Ross,Wait-wait-wait!
336,Ross,"Joey, did you propose to her?"
337,Joey,No.
338,Rachel,Yes you did!
339,Joey,"Actually, technically, I didn't."
340,Rachel,Well then why did you give me a ring?
341,Ross,Wait!
342,Ross,"Whoa-whoa, youyou gave her the ring?"
343,Joey,No!
344,Joey,"No, and I did not ask her to marry me!"
345,Rachel,"Yes, you did!"
346,Joey,"No, I didn't!"
347,Rachel,"Yes, you did!"
348,Joey,"No, I didn't!"
349,Rachel,"Yes, you did!"
350,Rachel,"And don't you say, ""No, I didn't!"""
351,Joey,Ahhh!
352,Rachel,He was right there.
353,Rachel,He got down on one knee and proposed.
354,Ross,Whoa!
355,Ross,You were down on one knee?
356,Joey,Yeah.
357,Joey,"Yeah, that looks bad."
358,Joey,But I didn'tI didn't propose!
359,Ross,Then what did happen?
360,Rachel,"Yeah, what did happen?"
361,Joey,"Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing."
362,Rachel,"Yeah, but you said, ""Will you marry me?"""
363,Joey,"No, I didn't!"
364,Rachel,"Yes, you did!"
365,Joey,"No, I didn't!"
366,Rachel,"Yes, you didOh my God you didn't!"
367,Rachel,Well then why didn't you tell me that before?
368,Joey,"Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!"
369,Ross,Whoa!
370,Ross,Hey!
371,Ross,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?"
372,Joey,I'll tell you about it later.
373,Joey,Be cool.
374,Rachel,"Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?"
375,Joey,It wasn't my ring!
376,Joey,It's Ross's ring!
377,Joey,"That's why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose."
378,Ross,What?
379,Rachel,You were gonna propose to me?
380,Ross,Uhh No.
381,Joey,"Well, this is awkward."
382,Joey,{See?
383,Joey,I told you so.}
384,Ross,"But I-I was going to see if y'know, maybe you uh, start dating again but thatI mean that-that was all, Rach."
385,Joey,"Dude, step up!"
386,Joey,I proposed.
387,Ross,"No, you didn't!"
388,Joey,Oh that's right.
389,Joey,There's a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.
390,Rachel,Okay.
391,Ross,I can't believe you told her I was going to propose!
392,Joey,I can't believe you're not going to propose!
393,Ross,"Hey, I'm not going to rush into anything!"
394,Joey,"Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand."
395,Joey,Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!
396,Rachel,Oh my God!
397,Ross,What?
398,Rachel,"She's doing it Look, she's breast-feeding look!"
399,Joey,"Ah, it's beautiful."
400,Rachel,Okay.
401,Ross,Thank you.
402,Rachel,"Oh wow, this feels weird."
403,Ross,Good weird?
404,Rachel,Wonderful weird.
405,Joey,Y'know what you guys?
406,Joey,"I'm uh, I'm gonna go too."
407,Joey,"And uh, I'm sorry about everything."
408,Rachel,"Honey don't worry, it was my mistake."
409,Joey,"No, Rach, I should've told you sooner."
410,Joey,It's just thatMan!
411,Joey,That kid is going to town!
412,Rachel,She's perfect.
413,Ross,We're so lucky.
414,Rachel,We really are.
415,Ross,"Look, I-I know it's not a proposal and I don't know where you are, but with everything that's been going on and with Emma andI've been feeling"
416,Rachel,I know.

422,Rachel,"Yeah, maybe."
423,Ross,"Well good, okay."
424,Ross,"I-I, kind of think y'know if weif You're wearing the ring."
425,Rachel,Wh-what's that?
426,Ross,And you told Phoebe you were engaged.
427,Rachel,"I'm sorry, what?"
428,Ross,When you thought Joey proposed diddid you say yes?

18,Chandler,Really?
19,Chandler,I don't like baths.
20,Monica,"Wait, you like them with me."
21,Chandler,"Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy, it's the wet, naked lady."
22,Monica,"Oh, baths are so relaxing!"
23,Chandler,Really?
24,Chandler,What do you do?

45,Joey,"I mean, there are  rules there, too!"
46,Joey,You know what I mean?
47,Chandler,Do you?
48,Joey,It was different for you guys!
49,Joey,"I mean, I mean, you were both in the same  place, right?"
50,Chandler,In London?
51,Joey,Yeah.
52,Chandler,Yes.
53,Chandler,"When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London."
54,Joey,You know what?
55,Joey,This is a bad idea.
56,Joey,Forget it.
57,Joey,"Forget it, and listen, do me a  favor, this conversation was between you and me."
58,Chandler,If that.
59,Rachel,Hi!
60,Rachel,"Oh, Ross, don't forget, we have that doctor's appointment  tomorrow!"
61,Ross,Right.
62,Phoebe,"Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?"
63,Ross,"No-no, we talked about it."
64,Ross,We don't want to know.
65,Ross,All we care about is  that it's happy and healthy.
66,Rachel,Yep!
67,Rachel,Happy and healthy!
68,Rachel,And cute!
69,Ross,And smart!
70,Rachel,Popular.
71,Ross,With an aptitude for science.
72,Phoebe,Are you two talking about the same baby?
73,Phoebe,Hey!
74,Phoebe,Have you started off thinking  of names yet?
75,Rachel,Oh yeah!
76,Rachel,I've come up with a bunch of ideas!
77,Ross,Really?
78,Ross,Me too!
79,Phoebe,Me too!
80,Rachel,Really?
81,Phoebe,Uh huh!
82,Phoebe,"If it's a girl, Phoebe, and if it's a boy, Phoebo!"
83,Ross,Maybe.
84,Ross,"But it wouldn't hurt to have a backup, you know?"
85,Ross,"Uh, Rach-Rach,  what were you thinking?"
86,Rachel,Okay!
87,Rachel,"I was thinking if it's a girl, how about Sandrine?"
88,Rachel,It's  French.
89,Ross,Huh.
90,Ross,That's a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.
91,Rachel,"Okay fine, what do you have?"
92,Ross,"Well, OK, it's for a boy."
93,Ross,"Well, I know it's a little out there,  butDarwin."
94,Rachel,"Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard."
95,Phoebe,"Yeah, by Sandrine."
96,Ross,You're just saying that 'cause I said no to your name!
97,Rachel,"I'm really, really not."
98,Phoebe,How-how about you each get five vetoes?
99,Ross,All right.
100,Rachel,All right.
101,Ross,That sounds fair.
102,Rachel,Yeah!
103,Rachel,I don't think you're going to need it though.
104,Rachel,"Okay, check  this out."
105,Rachel,"If it's a girl, Rain."
106,Ross,Veto.
107,Rachel,Why?
108,Ross,Rain?
109,Ross,Hi.
110,Ross,"Hi, my name is Rain."
111,Ross,"I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out  of wheat."
112,Phoebe,I know her!
113,Phoebe,I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!
114,Ross,"Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?"
115,Rachel,"Ross, why do you hate our child?"
116,Ross,"Fine, you go."
117,Rachel,"Okay, James."
118,Ross,Huh.
119,Rachel,But only if it's a girl.
120,Ross,"Oh, veto."
121,Ross,"How aboutOoh, I like Ruth!"
122,Ross,What about Ruth?
123,Rachel,Oh!
124,Rachel,I'm sorry!
125,Rachel,Are we having an 89-year-old?
126,Rachel,How about Dayton?
127,Ross,Veto.
128,Ross,Stewart?
129,Rachel,Veto.
130,Rachel,Sawyer?
131,Ross,Veto.
132,Ross,Helen?
133,Rachel,Veto.
134,Phoebe,"Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?"
135,Chandler,Hey.
136,Monica,"Boy, do I have a surprise for you!"
137,Chandler,Sex on the balcony?
138,Monica,"No, but someone's really not going to get over that idea, are they?"
139,Chandler,What is it?
140,Monica,I drew you a bath!
141,Chandler,"Honey, I don't like baths!"
142,Chandler,Could you draw me a picture of us having  sex on the balcony?
143,Monica,"Please, could you just try it for me?"
144,Monica,"Come on, I used all my best stuff!"
145,Monica,I-I-I lit some candles.
146,Monica,I put on some music.
147,Monica,"I used bath salts, plus bubble bath!"
148,Monica,And got  you this little plastic Navy ship.
149,Monica,So it's a boy bath!
150,Chandler,"Well, this does butch it up a bit."
151,Monica,"I swear, if you try it, you will love it!"
152,Chandler,"All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?"
153,Monica,Absolutely.
154,Monica,Bet I know how that discussion's going to go.
155,Chandler,"All right, this isn't so bad."
156,Chandler,I like the flower  smell!
157,Chandler,"Which is okay, because I've got my boat."
158,Monica,So?
159,Chandler,Oh my God.
160,Monica,I told you you were a bath person!
161,Monica,"Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you  a facial!"
162,Chandler,I'm going to need a bigger boat.
163,Ross,I don't think you had an open mind about the name Ruth.
164,Ross,"I mean, come on,  little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?"
165,Rachel,"Oh, oh my God!"
166,Rachel,I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!
167,Rachel,Dr.
168,Ross,"Uh, no."
169,Ross,"No, we're not."
170,Rachel,But you have it right there in that file?
171,Rachel,You could tell us whether  it's a boy or a girl?
172,Rachel,Dayton or Sandrine?
173,Rachel,Phoebe or Phoebo?
174,Rachel,Dr.
175,Ross,"No, no, we want to wait, right?"
176,Rachel,Right.
177,Rachel,Right.
178,Rachel,Dr.
179,Rachel,"So, which of these  babies do you think is the ugliest?"
180,Ross,What?
181,Ross,Rach!
182,Ross,"Come on, that's terrible!"
183,Ross,They'reuhthey're babies.
184,Ross,They're-they're all beautiful.
185,Rachel,Third one from the left?
186,Ross,"Yeah, why is it staring at me?"
187,Ross,I think it knows I'm talking about it.
188,Ross,Don't-don't youWhWhaHey!
189,Rachel,What?
190,Ross,You're looking!
191,Rachel,I didn't!
192,Ross,I saw you!
193,Rachel,"Okay fine, I did."
194,Rachel,"But I didn't see anything, I swear."
195,Ross,Shame on you!
196,Ross,Ugly baby judges you!
197,Rachel,"Okay, but Ross just listen to me"
198,Ross,"No, no, no, no!"
199,Ross,Don't tell me!
200,Ross,I don't want to know!
201,Rachel,"But I couldn't even if I wanted to, because I don't know!"
202,Rachel,"I  swear; I didn't see anything, and I don't want to know!"
203,Rachel,It was just a momentary  lapse.
204,Ross,Momentary lapse.
205,Ross,Don't-don't you have any self-control?
206,Rachel,"Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross."
207,Monica,Hello?
208,Chandler,"I'm in the bathroom, can you come in here?"
209,Chandler,I think there's  something wrong.
210,Monica,You know what?
211,Monica,I-I think I'll wait out here.
212,Chandler,I'm in the bathtub.
213,Monica,Oh.
214,Monica,What's wrong?
215,Chandler,"I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong!"
216,Chandler,The water's tepid.
217,Chandler,The salt  didn't dissolve and is now lodged places.
218,Chandler,And the scents I used don't  compliment each other.
219,Chandler,Eucalyptus and chamomileOh!
220,Monica,What?
221,Chandler,The bath salts!
222,Chandler,They're starting to effervesce!
223,Chandler,It's different.
224,Chandler,It's interesting.
225,Monica,"Okay, let's talk about something else."
226,Chandler,Yeah!
227,Chandler,"Sure, sure."
228,Chandler,"So, what was going on with you today?"
229,Chandler,Oh-oh-oh!
230,Monica,"Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey."
231,Monica,He was talking  about rules and right and wrong and
232,Chandler,I had the exact same conversation.
233,Monica,You did?
234,Monica,What was he talking about?
235,Chandler,I don't know!
236,Chandler,Joey hasn't had this much trouble getting out  words since we saw him in Macbeth!
237,Monica,That was a long night.
238,Chandler,"All right, let's break this down."
239,Chandler,What exactly did he say to you?
240,Monica,"Okay, he was talking about rules."
241,Chandler,Uh-huh.
242,Monica,"Umm, and looking at people differently."
243,Chandler,He didn't say anything about that to me.
244,Monica,What did he tell you?
245,Chandler,"He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London."
246,Chandler,"And, of  course the glue that holds this all together, the rules."
247,Monica,Okay.
248,Monica,"So you, me and London."
249,Monica,Looking at people differently.
250,Monica,Maybe he wants  to do what you and I did in London with someone.
251,Chandler,But what did he mean by rules?
252,Monica,Wait a minute!
253,Monica,He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!
254,Chandler,Because he was looking at her differently.
255,Monica,"And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!"
256,Chandler,My God!
257,Chandler,He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
258,Phoebe,You guys?
259,Monica,Just a minute!
260,Monica,That's Mrs. Tribbiani!
261,Chandler,You don't say anything.
262,Monica,Why would I say anything?
263,Monica,That two of our best friends could start the  greatest love affair of their lives!
264,Monica,"And they would have me to thank, and we could all  start having babies?"
265,Chandler,I'm not going to let you say anything.
266,Monica,You just stay here!
267,Chandler,"Oh, God!"
268,Phoebe,"Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron."
269,Monica,"Oh, you had that?"
270,Phoebe,Uh-huh.
271,Monica,I thought I lost it.
272,Monica,"I got a new one, like, a month ago."
273,Phoebe,"Oh, just as well, I broke this one."
274,Phoebe,What?
275,Monica,Nothing.
276,Phoebe,Okay.
277,Monica,"I mean, I-I, I really shouldn't say."
278,Monica,"I mean, I'm really not  supposed to."
279,Phoebe,Fine.
280,Monica,It's a humdinger!
281,Phoebe,Then it's really too bad that you can't tell me.
282,Monica,Somebody likes you!
283,Phoebe,Is it Chandler?
284,Monica,No!
285,Phoebe,"Well, then tell him to stop staring!"
286,Monica,It's Joey!
287,Phoebe,Really?!
288,Phoebe,Joey?!
289,Phoebe,You don't say.
290,Monica,Is it something you'd be interested in?
291,Phoebe,"I don't know, I don't know, I don't know."
292,Phoebe,"You know, I mean,  on the one hand, Mother may I?"
293,Phoebe,But y'know on the other hand No.
294,Phoebe,"No, I  can't."
295,Phoebe,We're friends.
296,Phoebe,"No, oh, no."
297,Phoebe,I don't want to risk what we have.
298,Monica,I guess that makes sense.
299,Monica,"So, you think you're going to talk to him?"
300,Phoebe,"Sure, yeah."
301,Phoebe,"I mean, it's Joey."
302,Phoebe,I don't want him to get hurt.
303,Phoebe,"Well, I must say, I am on fire!"
304,Phoebe,"First Chandler, now Joey!"
305,Monica,"Not Chandler, just Joey."
306,Phoebe,Sure.
307,Phoebe,Commercial Break
308,Rachel,Hey.
309,Ross,Hey.
310,Rachel,You know what?
311,Rachel,I've been thinking about it.
312,Rachel,I'm really coming  around on the name Ruth.
313,Rachel,I think I would actually consider naming our child that.
314,Ross,"Rach, I-I can't tell you how-how much that means to me!"
315,Ross,Ohh Wait a  minute.
316,Ross,Wait a minute.
317,Ross,You-you hated the name Ruth!
318,Ross,Why-why would you change your mind?
319,Ross,"Unless, you know we're never going to have to use it."
320,Ross,You did see the folder.
321,Ross,You  know it's a boy!
322,Rachel,I didn't see anything!
323,Rachel,I actually changed my mind about the name.
324,Ross,I don't think so!
325,Ross,"You're just giving me Ruth so you'll get to  name it when it's a boy, and that's when you'll swoop in and name him Heath  or Blaine or Sequoia."
326,Rachel,I wouldSequoia?
327,Ross,Veto.
328,Rachel,Fine.
329,Ross,"Unless  You anticipated that I would figure all  this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named  Ruth!"
330,Ross,"Well, I'm not falling for that!"
331,Ross,Okay?
332,Ross,Ruth is off the table!
333,Rachel,"But Ross, you want the name Ruth!"
334,Ross,Not like this!
335,Phoebe,Hey.
336,Joey,Hey.
337,Joey,"Well, what's up?"
338,Phoebe,"Umm, Joey, I know."
339,Joey,What?
340,Phoebe,I knooow.
341,Joey,Whaaat?
342,Phoebe,I know about your feelings.
343,Joey,Oh my God.
344,Joey,You do?
345,Phoebe,"Yes, and I'm sorry."
346,Phoebe,"I-I know things worked out for Chandler and  Monica, but that's very rare."
347,Joey,I know.
348,Joey,I know.
349,Joey,And this is so much more complicated than it was for those  guys.
350,Joey,"I mean, it's Rachel for God sakes."
351,Phoebe,"For God sakes, it's Rachel!"
352,Joey,I know.
353,Joey,I know.
354,Joey,And she's not only my friend; she's my pregnant  friend!
355,Joey,She's my pregnant friend who's Ross' ex!
356,Phoebe,Yeah that's Rachel.
357,Phoebe,Beat me over the head with it.
358,Joey,What am I going to do?
359,Joey,"You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of  these feelings, y'know?"
360,Joey,I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I  don't like about her.
361,Joey,You want to hear it?
362,Phoebe,Yeah.
363,Joey,She made me switch to light Mayo.
364,Joey,That's it!
365,Joey,That's all I got!
366,Joey,"And,  you know what?"
367,Joey,It tastes the same and my pants fit better!
368,Phoebe,"Joey, I just think you're getting worked up over nothing."
369,Phoebe,This is  probably just a crush.
370,Joey,You think?
371,Phoebe,Absolutely!
372,Phoebe,"Y'know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes  away."
373,Joey,"Yeah, just a crush!"
374,Joey,That's all this is!
375,Joey,It's a crush!
376,Joey,I'm  Joey; I don't get deep feelings.
377,Phoebe,"That's right, there you go!"
378,Phoebe,Crushes happen all the time!
379,Phoebe,I know  I've had them for all you guys.
380,Phoebe,"Well, except for Ross and Chandler."
381,Phoebe,And I'm sure  you've had them for us.
382,Joey,Not really.
383,Phoebe,Mm-hmm.
384,Phoebe,Throw me a bone here.
385,Ross,"So, I uh I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby."
386,Rachel,What?
387,Ross,That's right.
388,Ross,The student has become the master.
389,Rachel,"Ross, I swear, I don't know."
390,Ross,"Oh, come on, you know it's a girl!"
391,Rachel,A what?
392,Ross,You really didn't know?
393,Rachel,We're having a girl?
394,Ross,No.
395,Rachel,That's what you just said!
396,Ross,No.
397,Rachel,You said girl!
398,Ross,Yes.
399,Ross,I'm I'm sorry.
400,Ross,I'm so sorry.
401,Rachel,I'm not!
402,Rachel,We're having a girl!
403,Rachel,Sometimes I can't believe  it's with youBut still!
404,Rachel,We're having a girl!
405,Ross,I know!
406,Ross,I know.
407,Ross,You know what?
408,Ross,I'm putting Ruth back on the table!
409,Rachel,"Oh, yes!"
410,Rachel,We'll have ourselves a little baby Ruth
411,Ross,Permission to veto.
412,Rachel,"Yes, please."
413,Monica,Hey.
414,Chandler,Do I smell essential oils?
415,Monica,"Yeah, I'm going to take a bath."
416,Monica,I'm just going to get a magazine.
417,Chandler,Okay.
418,Monica,What do you think you're doing?
419,Chandler,L-leaving my troubles behind?
420,Monica,"I know that you're new at this, but this is completely unacceptable  bath decorum."
421,Chandler,"Oh, it's so hard to care when you're this relaxed."
422,Monica,"Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat."
423,Monica,Now you're  just a girl in a tub!
424,Chandler,Hey!
425,Phoebe,"Hi, Bubbles."
426,Phoebe,Manly.
427,Phoebe,"Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know  how it went with Joey."
428,Chandler,You told her?
429,Monica,She pulled it out of me!
430,Monica,She's like a conversational wizard!
431,Monica,How'd it go?
432,Phoebe,"Well, you were wrong, he doesn't like me!"
433,Monica,What?
434,Phoebe,Yeah!
435,Phoebe,"How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors' house and  told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didn't  like you?"
436,Phoebe,How would you feel?
437,Monica,I don't think I'd care.
438,Phoebe,Really?
439,Phoebe,Lee Majors is hot!
440,Joey,Hello?
441,Phoebe,We're in the bathroom!
442,Joey,Why?
443,Chandler,Because it's a relaxing and enjoyable time!
444,Joey,What are you guys doing in here?
445,Monica,Oh my God!
446,Monica,"A friend he's looking at differently, but it's wrong."
447,Monica,It's Rachel!
448,Chandler,You like Rachel?
449,Joey,"It's no big deal, okay?"
450,Joey,Phoebe and I talked about it.
451,Joey,It's just a  crush!
452,Joey,It's going to go away!
453,Joey,"Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles!"
454,Joey,Oh!
455,Phoebe,Mazel tov.
456,Rachel,Hey!
457,Rachel,Ross and I were looking for you!
458,Rachel,What are we all doing in  here?
459,Rachel,"Oh, my!"
460,Monica,"Honey, cover it up with the boat!"
461,Ross,Hello?
462,Chandler,Yes we're all in here and we would love for you to  join us!
463,Ross,Well hey!
464,Ross,What's going on?
465,Ross,"Ooh, cool boatOh, no."
466,Ross,"Hey, did you, did you tell them?"
467,Rachel,"No, I was waiting for you!"
468,Phoebe,Tell us what?
469,Rachel,We're having a girl.
470,Chandler,I'llI'll get you later!
471,Joey,All right.
472,Joey,"It's a new day, and it's just a  crush, that's all!"
473,Joey,Just a little crush!
474,Joey,"All that worrying I was doing,  that was crazy."
475,Joey,Crazy!
476,Joey,"Like my friend here the bird would say, ""it  was cuckoo!"""
477,Joey,Everything's going to be fine.
478,Joey,It's just a crush.
479,Rachel,"Hi, sweetie."
480,Joey,I love you.
481,Joey,Closing Credits
482,Monica,"It sure is nice to do this together, isn't it?"
483,Chandler,Yeah.
484,Chandler,And what you're doing feels so good.
485,Monica,I'm not touching you.
486,Chandler,You're not?
487,Monica,It's the salts.
488,Chandler,"Oh, sweet Lord."
489,Chandler,New realms of pleasure!
490,Monica,"Whatever keeps you off the balcony, big guy!"
491,Monica,End
0,Ross,Guys?
1,Ross,There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.
2,Monica,W-wait.
3,Monica,What is that?
4,Ross,'That' would be Marcel.
5,Ross,You wanna say hi?
6,Monica,"No, no, I don't."
7,Rachel,"Oh, he is precious!"
8,Rachel,Where did you get him?
9,Ross,My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
10,Phoebe,That is so cruel!
11,Phoebe,Why?
12,Phoebe,Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
13,Chandler,"Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!"
14,Monica,"Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?"
15,Ross,Yeah.
16,Ross,"I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so..."
17,Monica,Why don't you just get a roommate?
18,Ross,"Nah, I dunno..."
19,Ross,"I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe-  ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'."
20,Ross,Opening Credits
21,Phoebe,"So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight."
22,Phoebe,"I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman."
23,Chandler,Might wanna open with the snowman.
24,Monica,"So, how'd it go?"
25,Joey,"Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job."
26,Ross,How could you not get it?
27,Ross,You were Santa last year.
28,Joey,I dunno.
29,Joey,Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager.
30,Joey,"He's not even jolly, it's all political."
31,Monica,So what are you gonna be?
32,Joey,"Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers."
33,Joey,"It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?"
34,Rachel,"Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's?"
35,Rachel,"Gee, what?!"
36,Rachel,What is wrong with New Year's?
37,Chandler,"Nothing for you, you have Paolo."
38,Chandler,You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this
39,Rachel,"Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you."
40,Phoebe,"Yeah, you wish!"
41,Chandler,It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday.
42,Chandler,"I say this year, no dates, we make a pact."
43,Chandler,Just the six of us- dinner.
44,Chandler,"Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm."
45,Rachel,"Phoebe, you're on."
46,Phoebe,"Oh, oh, good."
47,Rachel,"Okay, hi."
48,Rachel,"Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay."
49,Rachel,Wooh!
50,Phoebe,"Thanks, hi."
51,Phoebe,"Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year."
52,Phoebe,"I made a man with eyes of coal   And a smile so bewitchin',   How was I supposed to know   That my mom was dead in the kitchen?"
53,Phoebe,La lalala la la la la lalala la la...
54,Phoebe,"...My mother's ashes   Even her eyelashes   Are resting in a little yellow jar,   And sometimes when it's breezy..."
55,Phoebe,"...I feel a little sneezy   And now I-    Excuse me, excuse me!"
56,Phoebe,"Yeah, noisy boys!"
57,Phoebe,Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group?
58,Phoebe,"Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!"
59,Chandler,That guy's going home with a note!
60,Phoebe,Could you speak up please?
61,Phoebe,"Okay, we're gonna take a short break."
62,Joey,"Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!"
63,Ross,"Come here, Marcel."
64,Ross,Sit here.
65,Rachel,"Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet."
66,Rachel,"I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts!"
67,Rachel,...Ooh.
68,Rachel,Did I just share too much?
69,Ross,Just a smidge.
70,Phoebe,"David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy."
71,Phoebe,He's very methodical.
72,Monica,I think it's romantic.
73,Phoebe,Me too!
74,Phoebe,Oh!
75,Phoebe,Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
76,Rachel,Yeah!
77,Phoebe,"Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with."
78,Phoebe,"Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter..."
79,Phoebe,I just- I just wanna be with him all the time.
80,Phoebe,"Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions..."
81,Chandler,"Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you."
82,Chandler,You're gonna break the pact.
83,Chandler,She's gonna break the pact.
84,Phoebe,"No, no, no, no, no, no."
85,Phoebe,"Yeah, could I just?"
86,Chandler,"Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice."
87,Monica,What?
88,Ross,"C'mon, this was a pact!"
89,Ross,This was your pact!
90,Chandler,"I snapped, okay?"
91,Chandler,I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
92,Monica,"Yeah, but Janice?"
93,Monica,That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
94,Chandler,"I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!"
95,Joey,Hi.
96,Joey,"Hi, sorry I'm late."
97,Chandler,Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
98,Joey,"Nice shoes, huh?"
99,Chandler,"Aah, y'killing me!"
100,Monica,Ross!
101,Monica,He's playing with my spatulas again!
102,Ross,"Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?"
103,Monica,Do you always have to bring him here?
104,Ross,I didn't wanna leave him alone.
105,Ross,Alright?
106,Ross,We- we had our first fight this morning.
107,Ross,I think it has to do with my working late.
108,Ross,"I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces..."
109,Chandler,"Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you."
110,Ross,"Oh, that'd be great!"
111,Ross,"Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me."
112,Chandler,"Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie."
113,Phoebe,"Okay, alright, I have a question, then."
114,Phoebe,"Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?"
115,Phoebe,Sure.
116,Phoebe,"Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella."
117,Phoebe,"I mean, you're a sweeper!"
118,Phoebe,...trapped inside a physicist's body.
119,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it."
120,Phoebe,"You should just do it, just sweep and throw me."
121,Phoebe,"Oh yeah, right now."
122,Phoebe,"Okay, now you're just kinda tidying."
123,Phoebe,I can hop.
124,Ross,So tell me something.
125,Ross,What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
126,Monica,"I'm sorry, okay."
127,Monica,"It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby."
128,Chandler,Fun Bobby?
129,Chandler,Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
130,Monica,Yeah.
131,Joey,You know more than one Fun Bobby?
132,Chandler,I happen to know a Fun Bob.
133,Rachel,"Okay, here we go..."
134,Joey,"Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!"
135,Rachel,There.
136,Rachel,Now there is.
137,Ross,"Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates."
138,Joey,"Uh, four."
139,Ross,Four.
140,Rachel,Five.
141,Ross,Five.
142,Rachel,Sorry.
143,Rachel,Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
144,Joey,"Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store."
145,Joey,What's an elf to do?
146,Ross,"Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?"
147,Rachel,"Oh, c'mon."
148,Rachel,"We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who."
149,Ross,"Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now."
150,Monica,What's the matter?
151,Ross,"Oh, it's-it's Marcel."
152,Ross,"He keeps shutting me out, y'know?"
153,Ross,He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...
154,Chandler,"That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night."
155,Ross,Really.
156,Chandler,"Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing."
157,Ross,"What, uh... what juggling thing?"
158,Chandler,With the balled-up socks?
159,Chandler,I figured you taught him that.
160,Ross,No.
161,Chandler,"Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal."
162,Chandler,He just balled up socks... and a melon...
163,Phoebe,"Oh, hi Max!"
164,Phoebe,"Hey, do you know everybody?"
165,Phoebe,"No, no, he hasn't been around."
166,Phoebe,Minsk?
167,Phoebe,I know where Minsk is.
168,Phoebe,"So when, when do you leave?"
169,Phoebe,Hello?
170,Phoebe,Hi.
171,Phoebe,"Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so  congratulations!"
172,Phoebe,This is so exciting!
173,Phoebe,"Oh, you're not going?"
174,Phoebe,"Oh, why?"
175,Phoebe,So-so you're really not going?
176,Phoebe,Oh don't do that.
177,Phoebe,Oh no no.
178,Phoebe,"Oh, but I can't do that-"
179,Phoebe,"It's your thing, and-"
180,Phoebe,"Okay, um, stay."
181,Phoebe,Stay.
182,Phoebe,Getting so good at that!
183,Chandler,You remember Janice.
184,Monica,Vividly.
185,Monica,Hi.
186,Joey,Sandy!
187,Joey,Hi!
188,Joey,C'mon in!
189,Joey,...You brought your kids.
190,Ross,Par-tay!
191,Monica,That thing is not coming in here.
192,Ross,'That thing'?
193,Ross,This is how you greet guests at a party?
194,Ross,"Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?"
195,Monica,I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
196,Ross,Okay.
197,Ross,He was more embarrassed about that than anyone.
198,Ross,Okay?
199,Ross,And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
200,Monica,Alright.
201,Monica,Just keep him away from me.
202,Ross,Thank you.
203,Ross,"C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling?"
204,Ross,"Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later."
205,Monica,Oh my gosh!
206,Monica,"Rachel, honey.. are you okay?"
207,Monica,Where-where's Paolo?
208,Rachel,Rome.
209,Rachel,Jerk missed his flight.
210,Phoebe,And then... your face is bloated?
211,Rachel,No.
212,Rachel,Okay.
213,Rachel,"I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me."
214,Rachel,Something about how it was her cab first.
215,Rachel,And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair!
216,Rachel,"So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me."
217,Rachel,And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party?
218,Rachel,Are people eating my dip?
219,Joey,"Wow, that's, uh, dirty."
220,Joey,"Hey, kids..."
221,Ross,Look at him.
222,Ross,"I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in."
223,Chandler,But you found me!
224,Chandler,Kill me.
225,Chandler,Kill me now.
226,Monica,Hey everybody!
227,Monica,It's Fun Bobby!
228,Monica,Fun
229,Joey,Hey Fun Bobby!
230,Joey,Whoah!
231,Joey,Who died?
232,Joey,Fun
233,Chandler,"Alright, Janice, that's it!"
234,Chandler,"Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-"
235,Chandler,I'm sorry you misunderstood...
236,Chandler,"Oh, will you give me the thing."
237,Phoebe,"Hi, Max!"
238,Phoebe,Are you alright?
239,Phoebe,You're going to Minsk.
240,Phoebe,"Oh, you are so going to Minsk."
241,Phoebe,You belong in Minsk.
242,Phoebe,You can't stay here just 'cause of me.
243,Phoebe,"Oh yes, yes, yes you can."
244,Phoebe,"Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'."
245,Phoebe,And I say 'your work?!
246,Phoebe,Your work?!
247,Phoebe,How can you say that?!'.
248,Phoebe,"And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice."
249,Phoebe,Can't you understand that?'.
250,Phoebe,And I say  'no!
251,Phoebe,No!
252,Phoebe,I can't understand that!
253,Phoebe,'.
254,Phoebe,"Ooh, sorry."
255,Phoebe,"Um, and, and then you put your arms around me."
256,Phoebe,And then you put your arms around me.
257,Phoebe,"And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me."
258,Phoebe,And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it.
259,Phoebe,I'm gonna miss you.
260,Phoebe,You scientist guy.
261,Phoebe,Dick
262,Joey,"There y'go, kids."
263,Chandler,And then the peacock bit me.
264,Chandler,Please kiss me at midnight.
265,Joey,You seen Sandy?
266,Chandler,Ooh.
267,Chandler,"Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek."
268,Chandler,"Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you."
269,Rachel,"Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing."
270,Rachel,The bll is drrbing!
271,Rachel,Dick
272,Chandler,And the moment of joy is upon us.
273,Joey,Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
274,Phoebe,Everybody looks so happy.
275,Phoebe,I hate that.
276,Monica,Not everybody's happy.
277,Monica,Hey Bobby!
278,Chandler,"Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here."
279,Chandler,"I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here."
280,Phoebe,I dunno.
281,Phoebe,I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
282,Rachel,I can't kiss anyone.
283,Monica,So I'm kissing everyone?
284,Joey,"Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother."
285,Ross,Perfect.
286,Ross,Perfect.
287,Ross,So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
288,Chandler,"Alright, somebody kiss me."
289,Chandler,"Somebody kiss me, it's midnight!"
290,Chandler,Somebody kiss me!
291,Joey,Alrightalrightalright.
292,Joey,There.
293,Joey,Closing Credits
294,Ross,I wanted this to work so much.
295,Ross,"I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in."
296,Ross,Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.
297,Rachel,...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
298,Rachel,End
0,Ross,Hello!
1,Ross,What's this?
2,Ross,Oh right its that girl's phone number.
3,Ross,"Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me."
4,Ross,"It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but... Whoa!"
5,Ross,"Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby!"
6,Ross,"Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it."
7,Phoebe,Thank you.
8,Phoebe,Opening Credits
9,Rachel,Yeah?
10,Rachel,"May fifth, why?"
11,Ross,"Oh, mine's December..."
12,Chandler,"Ohh, she's pretty."
13,Chandler,"Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty."
14,Monica,Just go up to her and ask her out.
15,Monica,"Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?"
16,Chandler,I could die.
17,Ross,"Yeah, it's-it's tough being single."
18,Ross,That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
19,Rachel,"Ross, you guys went out once."
20,Rachel,"You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her."
21,Chandler,I tell people secrets.
22,Chandler,It makes them like me.
23,Phoebe,Oh.
24,Chandler,Hey!
25,Monica,Phoebe!
26,Monica,"You're sick, you shouldn't play."
27,Monica,"You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there."
28,Phoebe,"But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now."
29,Phoebe,"Well music, and making my own shoes."
30,Phoebe,"Pretty, huh?"
31,Chandler,"All right, I'm gonna do it!"
32,Chandler,I'm gonna get shot down.
33,Chandler,Any advice?
34,Monica,Just be yourself.
35,Monica,"But, not too much."
36,Chandler,Wish me luck.
37,Ross,Good luck!
38,Chandler,Wish it!
39,Chandler,Hi.
40,Chandler,"Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler."
41,Chandler,My name is Chandler.
42,Chandler,Did I say that?
43,Chandler,"Uh Kathy, with K or a C?"
44,Chandler,Oh-oh-hey!
45,Chandler,"Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here."
46,Joey,Hey!
47,Chandler,Hey!
48,Chandler,"Hey, hey-hey, hey."
49,Joey,"Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?"
50,Chandler,"Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth."
51,Joey,Didn't I tell ya?
52,Joey,Always showin' off.
53,Phoebe,"Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose."
54,Phoebe,"Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People."
55,Phoebe,"Smelly cat, smelly cat."
56,Phoebe,What are they feeding you?
57,Phoebe,This chick sounds good.
58,Phoebe,"Smelly cat, smelly-- Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey."
59,Chandler,Hi!
60,Chandler,"Jeez, at"
61,Chandler,Oh my God!
62,Chandler,That's why I got up too!
63,Chandler,"Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were..."
64,Chandler,I never would've...
65,Chandler,"So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class."
66,Chandler,"That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him."
67,Chandler,Is it on?
68,Chandler,Hey!
69,Chandler,Oh!
70,Chandler,It's on!
71,Chandler,It's on!
72,Chandler,There we go little fella.
73,Chandler,Well the duck can swim.
74,Phoebe,"My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by!"
75,Phoebe,Thanks for the lights honey.
76,Monica,That cold makes you sound so great.
77,Phoebe,"It's fun, God I love how sexy I am."
78,Joey,"Oh, Kath, we should get going."
79,Joey,We're going to by hamsters.
80,Rachel,"Well, have fun!"
81,Phoebe,"Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters."
82,Monica,"Y'know what, I like Kathy."
83,Chandler,"Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty."
84,Rachel,"Yeah, she's..."
85,Chandler,"She's smart and funny, y'know?"
86,Chandler,"We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?"
87,Rachel,You love her.
88,Chandler,"No, I don't."
89,Phoebe,"Yes, you do."
90,Phoebe,Chandler loves Kathy.
91,Ross,"Come on, Pheebs lay off him."
92,Chandler,"Thank you, Ross."
93,Ross,"Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love."
94,Chandler,All right.
95,Chandler,All right.
96,Monica,"Ooh, umm, oh Kathy!"
97,Monica,"Kathy, I love you!"
98,Monica,Oh!
99,Phoebe,"So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me."
100,Monica,"Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?"
101,Phoebe,Uh-huh.
102,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that ""Woo-hoo"" thing."
103,Ross,Hey!
104,Monica,Hey!
105,Phoebe,Hey.
106,Ross,So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!
107,Monica,Rachel's not here.
108,Ross,Oh.
109,Monica,How's it going with her?
110,Ross,"Great, actually."
111,Ross,"I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night."
112,Ross,"Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little ""playing"" ourselves."
113,Rachel,Hi guys!
114,Rachel,This is Josh.
115,Rachel,"Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross."
116,Monica,"Hi, Josh."
117,Phoebe,Hi.
118,Monica,"So, did you play in college?"
119,Monica,sweatshirt he's wearing.)
120,Rachel,"Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School?"
121,Rachel,"Oh no wait, that's right."
122,Rachel,You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.
123,Rachel,Okay.
124,Rachel,I'll miss you.
125,Phoebe,"Wow, cute one!"
126,Monica,Very!
127,Rachel,"I know, isn't he great?"
128,Rachel,"It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know?"
129,Rachel,"There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum."
130,Ross,"Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something."
131,Rachel,"Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?"
132,Ross,Oh!
133,Rachel,What was that?
134,Ross,Monica knows.
135,Monica,It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents.
136,Monica,"It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it."
137,Monica,"I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother."
138,Ross,"Well, I'm gonna go get ready,  for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head."
139,Phoebe,"Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour."
140,Phoebe,"Hey,  you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me."
141,Phoebe,"Ooh,  My sticky shoes--eww!"
142,Phoebe,Eww!
143,Phoebe,I lost my sexy phlegm!
144,Ross,Hi!
145,Ross,Wow!
146,Ross,You-you look great!
147,Ross,Okay!
148,Ross,Hey Tommy.
149,Ross,"Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure."
150,Ross,What?
151,Ross,I-I-I...
152,Ross,Who wants to make some long distance calls?
153,Chandler,Kathy!
154,Chandler,Kathy!

167,Chandler,Okay.
168,Chandler,Commercial Break
169,Monica,Oh come on!
170,Monica,You're making it sound worse than it actually was.
171,Ross,Her date tipped me ten dollars.
172,Ross,"Pheebs, what are you doing?"
173,Phoebe,"Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold."
174,Phoebe,"It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common."
175,Monica,"Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia."
176,Chandler,Okay.
177,Chandler,You were right.
178,Chandler,I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
179,Phoebe,What?
180,Ross,Are you serious?
181,Phoebe,"Well, how-how-how is that possible?"
182,Phoebe,You barely know her!
183,Chandler,I don't know.
184,Chandler,"I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head."
185,Chandler,Y'know?
186,Chandler,"I mean, I'm a very bad person."
187,Chandler,"I'm a very, very bad person."
188,Chandler,I'm a horrible person.
189,Chandler,No you're not Chandler!
190,Chandler,We still love you Chandler!
191,Monica,"Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold."
192,Phoebe,You mean you stole it!
193,Phoebe,Don't cover your mouth when you do that!
194,Joey,Hey.
195,Chandler,Really?
196,Joey,"Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet."
197,Chandler,Right in there!
198,Chandler,99...100!
199,Chandler,"Ready or not, here I come!"
200,Chandler,"All right, let's go over the concept one more time."
201,Joey,Hey!
202,Chandler,Hey!
203,Joey,Hey guys.
204,Joey,"Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?"
205,Chandler,"Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate."
206,Joey,It's
207,Chandler,"Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know."
208,Chandler,So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
209,Joey,"Okay, I see what's going on here."
210,Chandler,You-you do?
211,Joey,Yeah!
212,Joey,You don't like Kathy.
213,Chandler,You got me.
214,Joey,"Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out."
215,Joey,"Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us."
216,Joey,Right?
217,Chandler,Yeah.
218,Chandler,Right.
219,Joey,"Good, and hey!"
220,Joey,My treat.
221,Joey,"But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?"
222,Chandler,Okay.
223,Monica,Ross isn't here.
224,Rachel,Oh.
225,Rachel,Stop it!
226,Rachel,Yeah!
227,Rachel,I am soo gonna marry that guy.
228,Rachel,Ohhh!
229,Monica,What?
230,Rachel,I think he's stealing from me.
231,Monica,Why?
232,Rachel,Because he's stealing from me!
233,Phoebe,Hi!
234,Phoebe,It's me.
235,Phoebe,And soup.
236,Phoebe,"Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket."
237,Rachel,Ughh!
238,Phoebe,"Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup."
239,Phoebe,"And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water."
240,Monica,Thank you so much Phoebe.
241,Phoebe,Sure.
242,Monica,What are you doing with those?
243,Phoebe,"But, I need your germs!"
244,Phoebe,I want my cold back!
245,Phoebe,I miss my sexy voice.
246,Monica,"Sorry, Phoebe."
247,Phoebe,It's okay.
248,Phoebe,How's the soup?
249,Monica,Umm.
250,Monica,Ohhhh!!
251,Monica,Gross!
252,Joey,Is she great or what?
253,Chandler,"Ohh, she's-she's not really my type."
254,Chandler,Y'know what I think it is?
255,Chandler,It's the fishnet stockings.
256,Chandler,Y'know?
257,Chandler,Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
258,Chandler,"Uhh, no-no thanks."
259,Chandler,"Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer."
260,Joey,I'll be right back.
261,Joey,What was that?
262,Chandler,What?
263,Joey,Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away.
264,Joey,I thought we had a deal.
265,Chandler,"Hey, look, what do you want from me?"
266,Joey,I want you to like her!
267,Joey,"But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend."
268,Chandler,I am pretending.
269,Joey,"Well then, do it better!"
270,Chandler,"Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her?"
271,Chandler,"No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her."
272,Chandler,That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her.
273,Chandler,"That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!"
274,Joey,"Well, that's pretty good."
275,Joey,But you might wanna tone it down a little.
276,Ross,Hey!
277,Ross,"So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off."
278,Ross,"Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive."
279,Ross,"So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?"
280,Monica,"No, sorry."
281,Rachel,Well where's Amanda?
282,Monica,"Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?"
283,Rachel,"I mean y'know, I'm thinking."
284,Rachel,"You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out."
285,Monica,"Ross, cough drops, please?"
286,Ross,At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
287,Rachel,Why don't you just marry her?
288,Rachel,"Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian."
289,Ross,You see Amanda and I have a very special...
290,Monica,You have nothing!
291,Monica,You're not even going out!
292,Monica,You're her baby sitter!
293,Monica,You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
294,Rachel,"Ohh, that is soo sad."
295,Monica,"And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'"
296,Rachel,"Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me!"
297,Rachel,At least he bought me something with it!
298,Monica,That's mine!!
299,Monica,"Now, would you both please start acting like adults?"
300,Monica,And get me my cough drops!
301,Ross,Fine.
302,Rachel,Sorry.
303,Ross,Here.
304,Ross,At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.
305,Rachel,Y'know...
306,Phoebe,Platting goats are platting.
307,Phoebe,Platting down the street.
308,Phoebe,"Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats."
309,Phoebe,Does it even work without my sexy voice?
310,Phoebe,"Gunther, kiss me."
311,Joey,Hey!
312,Joey,"Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?"
313,Chandler,Can I sleep on your couch?
314,Chandler,Closing Credits
315,Phoebe,And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man.
316,Phoebe,Thank you my babies.

3,Rachel,Look!
4,Rachel,"Look, there's Joey's picture!"
5,Rachel,This is so exciting!
6,Chandler,You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before.
7,Chandler,"Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom..."
8,Phoebe,The exclamation point in the title scares me.
9,Phoebe,"Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!"
10,Ross,"Oh, shhh, shh."
11,Ross,Magic is about to happen.
12,Joey,"Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear."
13,Joey,"All you want is a dingle,   What you envy's a schwang,   A thing through which you can tinkle,   Or play with, or simply let hang..."
14,Joey,Opening Credits
15,Rachel,God.
16,Rachel,I feel violated.
17,Monica,"Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?"
18,Chandler,"Ross, ten o'clock."
19,Ross,Is it?
20,Ross,Feels like two.
21,Chandler,"No, ten o'clock."
22,Ross,What?
23,Chandler,"There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!"
24,Ross,Oh.
25,Ross,Hel-lo!
26,Chandler,She's amazing!
27,Chandler,"She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!"
28,Monica,"Well, go over to her!"
29,Monica,She's not with anyone.
30,Chandler,"Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be?"
31,Chandler,'Excuse me.
32,Chandler,Blarrglarrghh.'
33,Rachel,"Oh, c'mon."
34,Rachel,"She's a person, you can do it!"
35,Chandler,"Oh please, could she be more out of my league?"
36,Chandler,"Ross, back me up here."
37,Ross,He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
38,Chandler,"Thank you, buddy."
39,Phoebe,"Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys."
40,Monica,You could do that!
41,Chandler,Y'think?
42,Chandler,"Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this..."
43,Chandler,I'm very very aware of my tongue...
44,Ross,C'mon!
45,Ross,C'mon!
46,Chandler,Here goes.
47,Chandler,"Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler!"
48,Chandler,"Chandler is my name, and, uh......hi."
49,Chandler,"Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight."
50,Joey,Whadja think?
51,Joey,"C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad."
52,Joey,"It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head."
53,Chandler,She said yes!!
54,Chandler,She said yes!!
55,Chandler,"Awful play, man."
56,Chandler,Whoah.
57,Chandler,"Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'."
58,Chandler,'Chand-lrr'.
59,Chandler,I think I like it better that way.
60,Chandler,"Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you."
61,Rachel,What is it?
62,Joey,The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency.
63,Joey,"Wow, an agency left me its card!"
64,Joey,Maybe they wanna sign me!
65,Phoebe,Based on this play?
66,Phoebe,...Based on this play!
67,Chandler,"Hey, kids."
68,Phoebe,"No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line."
69,Chandler,"Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went."
70,Monica,"Oh, right, right."
71,Monica,"How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?"
72,Chandler,It was unbelievable.
73,Chandler,I-I've never met anyone like her.
74,Chandler,She's had the most amazing life!
75,Chandler,She was in the Israeli army...
76,Chandler,Alright.
77,Chandler,"Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it."
78,Chandler,We talked 'til like two.
79,Chandler,It was this perfect evening... more or less.
80,Chandler,"Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?"
81,Joey,Who's Rick?
82,Chandler,Who's Rick?
83,Chandler,"Oh, so you're divorced?"
84,Chandler,"Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?"
85,Chandler,"So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?"
86,Chandler,Ethan?
87,Chandler,"There's, there's an Ethan?"
88,Chandler,"So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?"
89,Chandler,...Hm.
90,Monica,Oh.
91,Monica,I'm sorry it didn't work out.
92,Chandler,What 'not work out'?
93,Chandler,I'm seeing her again on Thursday.
94,Chandler,Didn't you listen to the story?
95,Monica,Didn't you listen to the story?
96,Monica,"I mean, this is twisted!"
97,Monica,How could you get involved with a woman like this?
98,Chandler,"Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good"
99,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah."
100,Phoebe,That is not true.
101,Phoebe,"Ross, is this your fantasy?"
102,Ross,"No, of course not!"
103,Ross,"...Yeah, yeah, it is."
104,Monica,What?
105,Monica,So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
106,Joey,I couldn't do it.
107,Monica,"Good for you, Joey."
108,Joey,"When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is."
109,Ross,"Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept."
110,Ross,"I mean, anthropologically speaking-"
111,Ross,Fine.
112,Ross,"Fine, alright, now you'll never know."
113,Monica,We're kidding.
114,Monica,"C'mon, tell us!"
115,Ross,Alright.
116,Ross,"There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-"
117,Rachel,Tah-daaah!
118,Chandler,Are we greeting each other this way now?
119,Chandler,'Cause I like that.
120,Rachel,Look!
121,Rachel,I cleaned!
122,Rachel,"I did the windows, I did the floors..."
123,Rachel,"I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for."
124,Ross,"Oh yeah, nobody knows."
125,Ross,And we're not supposed to ask.
126,Rachel,"Well, whaddya think?"
127,Monica,...Oh!
128,Monica,I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
129,Monica,How-how did that happen?
130,Rachel,I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there.
131,Rachel,"And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table."
132,Monica,"Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what?"
133,Monica,"Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot."
134,Monica,"Alright, just to compare."
135,Monica,Let's see.
136,Monica,"Well, it looks good there too."
137,Monica,Let's just leave it there for a while.
138,Phoebe,I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
139,Chandler,Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines.
140,Chandler,"I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out."
141,Monica,"You guys, I am not that bad!"
142,Phoebe,"Yeah, you are, Monica."
143,Phoebe,Remember when I lived with you?
144,Phoebe,"You were like, a little, y'know,  Ree!"
145,Phoebe,Ree!
146,Phoebe,Ree!
147,Phoebe,Ree!
148,Monica,That is so unfair!
149,Ross,Oh c'mon!
150,Ross,"When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!"
151,Monica,"Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised."
152,Monica,"But hey, I can be a kook."
153,Ross,"Alright, you madcap gal."
154,Ross,Try to imagine this.
155,Ross,"The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away."
156,Monica,Why not?
157,Ross,Because you're a kook!
158,Ross,Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
159,Monica,I could do that.
160,Rachel,"Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout."
161,Monica,Why would someone do that?!
162,Monica,...One might wonder.
163,Chandler,Someone's left a glass on the coffee table.
164,Chandler,There's no coaster.
165,Chandler,"It's a cold drink, it's a hot day."
166,Chandler,Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
167,Monica,STOP IT!!
168,Monica,...Oh my God.
169,Monica,It's true!
170,Monica,Who am I?
171,Ross,Monica?
172,Ross,You're Mom.
173,Phoebe,Ree!
174,Phoebe,Ree!
175,Phoebe,Ree!
176,Phoebe,Ree!
177,Phoebe,Ree!
178,Joey,Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God!
179,Joey,Okay!
180,Joey,"Okay, I'll be there!"
181,Joey,That was my agent.
182,Joey,My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
183,Monica,"Well, what's the part?"
184,Joey,Can you believe this?
185,Joey,Al Pacino!
186,Joey,This guy's the reason I became an actor!
187,Joey,"""I'm out of order?"
188,Joey,Pfeeeh.
189,Joey,You're out of order!
190,Joey,"This whole courtroom's out of order!"""
191,Phoebe,"Seriously, what-what's the part?"
192,Joey,"""Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"""
193,Ross,"C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?"
194,Joey,...I'm his
195,Rachel,"..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?"
196,Joey,...I'm his butt double.
197,Joey,'Kay?
198,Joey,I play Al Pacino's butt.
199,Joey,Alright?
200,Joey,"He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt."
201,Monica,Oh my God.
202,Joey,"C'mon, you guys."
203,Joey,"This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!"
204,Chandler,"Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness."
205,Joey,"Okay, okay, fine!"
206,Joey,"Make jokes, I don't care!"
207,Joey,This is a big break for me!
208,Ross,"You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?"
209,Ross,Commercial Break
210,Monica,"Alright, alright, alright..."
211,Joey,Here.
212,Joey,I need to borrow some moisturizer.
213,Monica,For what?
214,Joey,Whaddya think?
215,Joey,Today's the big day!
216,Monica,Oh my God.
217,Monica,"Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there."
218,Joey,Thank you!
219,Chandler,Where's Joey?
220,Chandler,His mom's on the phone.
221,Monica,He's in the bathroom.
222,Monica,I don't think you wanna go in there!
223,Chandler,"C'mon, we're roommates!"
224,Chandler,My eyes!!
225,Chandler,My eyes!
226,Monica,I warned you...
227,Rachel,Who is being loud?
228,Chandler,"Oh, that would be Monica."
229,Chandler,"Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast."
230,Monica,"Oh, you got the whole night, huh?"
231,Chandler,"Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.."
232,Rachel,"Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?"
233,Chandler,"No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it."
234,Chandler,'Kay?
235,Chandler,Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life?
236,Chandler,"Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?"
237,Monica,Sure.
238,Monica,"Oh, um, Chandler?"
239,Monica,"Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that."
240,Joey,"Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity."
241,Joey,Me?
242,Joey,Right.
243,Joey,Okay.
244,Joey,Losing the robe.
245,Joey,And the robe is lost.
246,Joey,"Well, I'm- I'm showering."
247,Joey,Oh.
248,Joey,"Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know?"
249,Joey,"I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing..."
250,Joey,I think his butt would be angry here.
251,Joey,I was going for quiet desperation.
252,Joey,But if you have to ask...
253,Chandler,"God, I love these fingers..."
254,Chandler,"No, actually I meant my fingers."
255,Chandler,"Look at 'em, look at how happy they are."
256,Chandler,"Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.."
257,Chandler,Don't go.
258,Chandler,"Too bad, she's leaving."
259,Chandler,"Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick."
260,Chandler,"What, Ethan?"
261,Chandler,He got to spend the whole day with you!
262,Chandler,"I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?"
263,Chandler,"Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?"
264,Chandler,"Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us."
265,Chandler,You.
266,Chandler,"Nono, just you."
267,Chandler,Lose the other guys.
268,Chandler,"C'mon, we're great together, why not?"
269,Chandler,"...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know?"
270,Chandler,"I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up!"
271,Chandler,This is great!'
272,Chandler,But there's this other guy.
273,Chandler,"Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard!"
274,Chandler,Get out!
275,Chandler,Get out!'
276,Chandler,"I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish..."
277,Chandler,...The second guy.
278,Chandler,"Sorry, the first guy runs the lips."
279,Ross,Look at it this
280,Monica,"Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?"
281,Joey,Nope.
282,Ross,No?
283,Ross,"What happened, big guy?"
284,Chandler,"""Big guy?"""
285,Ross,It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
286,Joey,I got fired.
287,Joey,"Yeah, they said I acted too much with it."
288,Joey,I told everybody about this!
289,Joey,"Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and..."
290,Rachel,"Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell."
291,Joey,My mom will.
292,Chandler,Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
293,Joey,"Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years."
294,Joey,"And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!"
295,Monica,Maybe this wasn't your shot.
296,Ross,"Yeah, I mean..."
297,Ross,"I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot."
298,Ross,Did it... feel like your shot..?
299,Joey,"Hard to tell, I was naked."
300,Phoebe,"No, I don't think this was your shot."
301,Phoebe,"I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot."
302,Phoebe,"I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do!"
303,Phoebe,You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part!
304,Phoebe,I got the part!
305,Phoebe,I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!
306,Phoebe,'.
307,Joey,Yeah?
308,Joey,That's so nice!
309,Monica,"I'm sorry, Joey."
310,Monica,"I'm gonna go to bed, guys."
311,Rachel,"Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?"
312,Monica,Uh-huh!
313,Rachel,Really?
314,Rachel,Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
315,Monica,"Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow."
316,Monica,Or not.
317,Monica,Whenever.
318,Ross,She is a kook.
319,Ross,Closing Credits
320,Monica,"If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes."
321,Monica,No.
322,Monica,Don't do this.
323,Monica,This is stupid!
324,Monica,"I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know."
325,Monica,"Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back!"
326,Monica,...I need help!
327,Monica,End
0,Monica,"Okay, now this one is rare, this one is medium well!"
1,Monica,Now go-go-go!
2,Monica,Hey Phoebe!
3,Phoebe,Hey!
4,Monica,Hey how was dinner?

21,Phoebe,Oh youyou made pesto?
22,Phoebe,Would you say your pesto is the best-o?
23,Monica,"All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad."
24,Phoebe,I made it myself.
25,Phoebe,"Well, it's no pesto."
26,Monica,"All right, all right!"
27,Monica,"Let's just cut to the chase, okay?"
28,Monica,You're single.
29,Monica,You're single.
30,Monica,He gets off work at eleven.
31,Monica,She'll be waiting for your call.
32,Monica,I'll give him your number if I can get one calamari and one Caesar salad!!
33,Monica,I did not yell.
34,Monica,I am not putting a dollar in the jar.
35,Monica,Opening Credits
36,Chandler,You know me sir.
37,Chandler,"Oh ah, I do have a question for ya."
38,Chandler,Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?
39,Chandler,Mr.
40,Chandler,What's funny about that?
41,Ross,Hey!
42,Ross,Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
43,Chandler,Hey that's okay.
44,Chandler,"So, where do you want to go?"

52,Chandler,Hey Bob.
53,Ross,Did that guy just call you Toby?
54,Chandler,"Yeah, he thinks that's my name."
55,Ross,"Well, why don't you correct him?"
56,Chandler,Oh it's been going on way to long now.
57,Chandler,"Y'know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn't say anything."
58,Chandler,"And then the next time he said, ""Hey Toby, do you want a donut?"""
59,Chandler,And I-I wanted a donut.
60,Chandler,"And now it's five years later, the donut's gone and I'm still Toby."
61,Ross,Five years?!
62,Ross,Chandler you have to tell him!
63,Chandler,No!
64,Chandler,That would be so awkward!
65,Chandler,"LookBesides, we work in different departments."
66,Chandler,He's on the sixth floor y'know?
67,Chandler,So he calls me Toby once in a while.
68,Chandler,What's the big deal?
69,Chandler,"It could be worse, it's not like he's calling me Muriel."
70,Ross,Muriel.
71,Ross,Wh-why would he call you Muriel?
72,Ross,Oh my God!
73,Ross,Chandler M Bing?
74,Ross,"It's not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!"
75,Chandler,Shh!
76,Chandler,It is a family name!
77,Ross,Chandler Muriel Bing.
78,Ross,"Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?"
79,Joey,"Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner."
80,Rachel,Well don'tWhat happened to Jessica's body?
81,Joey,"I'm not telling, you'll have to see it on TV!"
82,Rachel,You don't know do you?
83,Joey,"No, couldn't care less."
84,Joey,Joey's Co-Star
85,Joey,Hey you too!
86,Joey,Joey's Co-Star
87,Joey,What?
88,Joey,You weren't in it.
89,Rachel,Oh!
90,Joey,Oh sorry.
91,Joey,"Uh-uh, Kash?"
92,Joey,This is my friend Rachel.
93,Joey,"Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel."
94,Rachel,Hi.
95,Rachel,"Well, Joey probably thinks I'll just embarrass him."
96,Rachel,"Y'know, he thinks I'm some kind of a soap opera nutWhich I'm not!"
97,Rachel,I'm not.
98,Rachel,"Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan."
99,Rachel,"And uh, and that your-your dog's name is Wally."
100,Rachel,"Well look at that, I'm just stroking your arm."
101,Joey,Here we go!
102,Joey,Here we go!
103,Rachel,"Oh, we're leaving."
104,Rachel,Bye Kash.
105,Rachel,Say hi to Wally.
106,Phoebe,Ooh Monica!
107,Monica,Hi!
108,Phoebe,Oh my God!
109,Phoebe,I had the best time with Tim last night.
110,Phoebe,He is so sweet!
111,Phoebe,"Oh, I can't wait to get sous-neath him."
112,Monica,II have to fire him.
113,Phoebe,But why?
114,Monica,Because he's terrible!
115,Monica,"Okay, he's slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!"
116,Phoebe,"Well maybe he was just nervous, y'know you can be very intimidating."
117,Phoebe,And besides I've met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.
118,Monica,"Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished."
119,Phoebe,"But Monica, he loves his job so much!"
120,Phoebe,Can you just give him another chance?
121,Phoebe,Please?
122,Monica,"All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!"
123,Phoebe,That's fair!
124,Phoebe,Thank you so much.
125,Phoebe,Thanks.
126,Phoebe,"Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too."
127,Monica,I paid to have this done.
128,Phoebe,Love it!
129,Joey,Hey!
130,Rachel,Hi!
131,Joey,"Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day."
132,Joey,He said he thought you were charming.
133,Rachel,I thought I was a complete idiot.
134,Joey,"Hey, I'm with you."
135,Joey,He even asked me if I thought you'd go out with him.
136,Rachel,Oh!
137,Rachel,"Oh, I think I'm gonna throw up a little bit."
138,Rachel,What did you say?
139,Joey,I said no.
140,Rachel,What?
141,Joey,What?
142,Joey,II just figured since you're pregnant you're not gonna be seeing people.
143,Rachel,"Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people."
144,Rachel,"Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?"
145,Joey,I didn't tell him.
146,Joey,I didn't know if you were telling people.
147,Joey,This is back when I thought Kash was still people.
148,Rachel,"Good-good, don't tell him."
149,Rachel,Don't tell him.
150,Rachel,Just have him call me okay?
151,Joey,"Rach look, I really don't think that's such a great"
152,Rachel,"Okay, you go do it!"
153,Rachel,I'll come back to that set!
154,Rachel,I'll meet more actors!
155,Rachel,I'll meet em all!
156,Chandler,Hey Bob.
157,Chandler,"If I see him, I'll ask."
158,Chandler,Yeah!
159,Chandler,Mr.
160,Chandler,We're on a semi-first name basis.
161,Chandler,Mr.
162,Chandler,Bob?
163,Chandler,"Ooh, working here with us?"
164,Chandler,Everyday?
165,Chandler,"Yeah, I don't know if he has what it takes."
166,Chandler,Mr.
167,Chandler,But this is eleven.
168,Chandler,It's almost twice as hard up here.
169,Chandler,Mr.
170,Chandler,I think it's best sir.
171,Chandler,Mr.
172,Chandler,"Y'know what you should do, just toss em in the shedder and claim you never got em."
173,Chandler,Mr.
174,Chandler,What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?
175,Phoebe,Hey!
176,Monica,Hey.
177,Monica,"Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!"
178,Phoebe,But
179,Monica,No!
180,Monica,No-no!
181,Monica,He is totally incompetent.
182,Monica,I called the chef who recommended him to me.
183,Monica,"He said, ""Ha-ha!"
184,Monica,"Gotcha!"""
185,Phoebe,Okay.
186,Phoebe,"Okay, but you can't fire him today."
187,Monica,Why not?
188,Phoebe,Because I'm dumping him today.
189,Monica,What?!
190,Monica,You said he was sweet!
191,Phoebe,He is sweet.
192,Phoebe,He's too sweet.
193,Phoebe,He calls me all the time.
194,Phoebe,"""So did-did you get home from work okay?"""
195,Phoebe,"""Did-did you get out of the shower okay?"""
196,Monica,Just don't pick up your phone.
197,Phoebe,Then he comes over!
198,Phoebe,"""I'm so worried about you."""
199,Phoebe,Uck!
200,Phoebe,Be a man!
201,Monica,What?
202,Monica,So now I'm not allowed to fire him?
203,Phoebe,"You can't fire him and dump him the same day, he'll kill himself."
204,Monica,"Okay well then, I'll fire him today and you go out with him for another week."
205,Phoebe,Are you kidding?!
206,Phoebe,"Another week with that sip, I'll kill myself!"
207,Monica,"Okay well, then we'll both do it today and he'll just have to deal with it!"
208,Phoebe,Okay.
209,Phoebe,But the question is who's gonna go first.
210,Phoebe,Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.
211,Monica,What do you mean?
212,Phoebe,Come on!
213,Phoebe,"The boss that fires a guy that's just been dumped, bitch!"
214,Phoebe,"And the woman who dumps a guy that's just been fired, blond bitch!"
215,Monica,I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.
216,Phoebe,"All right, that makes sense."
217,Phoebe,Ugh.
218,Phoebe,ButScrew you I'm going first!
219,Chandler,"Sure, what's up?"
220,Rachel,"Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I'm not drinking on this date tonight."
221,Rachel,"""Umm, I'm a recovering alcoholic."
222,Rachel,"I'm a Mormon,"" or ""I got so hammered last night I'm still a little drunk?"""
223,Ross,Hey!
224,Rachel,Hi!
225,Joey,Hey!
226,Ross,"So, what do you want to do tonight?"
227,Ross,There's a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that's supposed to be very powerful.
228,Ross,Interested?
229,Joey,No.
230,Joey,No.
231,Joey,But I'll go see a normal person movie with ya.
232,Ross,Rach?
233,Ross,You wanna come?
234,Rachel,"Oh no, I can't."
235,Rachel,I got a date.
236,Ross,A date?
237,Rachel,Yeah.
238,Rachel,Why?
239,Rachel,Is that weird for you?
240,Ross,"Why no, it's the opposite of weird."
241,Ross,"It's-it's uh, regular."
242,Ross,"It's-it's uh, it's mundane."
243,Ross,"It's actually uh, a little dull."
244,Joey,It's no Ukrainian film.
245,Rachel,YeahOoh!
246,Rachel,Earrings!
247,Ross,A date?!
248,Ross,She's-she's got a date?!
249,Ross,With who?
250,Joey,I set her up with this actor on my show.
251,Ross,You set her up?
252,Joey,No
253,Ross,Joey what-what were you thinking?
254,Joey,"Well, I was thinking that it'd probably be okay because Ross hasn't gone out with Rachel in five years!"
255,Ross,"Joey, I'm not worried about her!"
256,Ross,I'm worried about my baby!
257,Ross,Whoever she dates my baby dates!
258,Ross,Now-now where is this  actor taking them?
259,Joey,Hey!
260,Joey,I'm an  actor too!
261,Joey,I'm not sure.
262,Joey,I think they're taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.
263,Ross,A ferry?
264,Ross,My baby is going on a ferry?
265,Ross,Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?
266,Joey,Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?
267,Ross,Why don't they just jump out of an airplane?!
268,Ross,Huh?!
269,Ross,That-that's a fun date!
270,Ross,Or burn each other with matches?!
271,Ross,That's fun too!
272,Ross,Whew!
273,Joey,Hey Kash.
274,Joey,Uh hey-hey this is Ross.
275,Joey,"Ross, this is Kash."
276,Ross,Hi.
277,Ross,I-I hear you're going on a ferry tonight.
278,Ross,A bit of a daredevil are we?
279,Rachel,Hey guys do you think this is too sluttyHi Kash!
280,Rachel,Yeah!
281,Rachel,"All right, I'll see you guys later."
282,Ross,Okay.
283,Ross,Have a great time you guys.
284,Rachel,Thank you.
285,Ross,Yes it is too slutty!
286,Ross,Commercial Break
287,Phoebe,Hi.
288,Phoebe,It will bein a minute.
289,Phoebe,"Listen, Tim you're a really great guy."
290,Phoebe,Aw.
291,Phoebe,I'm justI'm in a place in my life right now where II
292,Phoebe,Oh-oh no she doesn't!
293,Phoebe,I know what that is.
294,Phoebe,You can stay.
295,Joey,So what movie do you want to seeAnd not another one I have to read.
296,Joey,Okay?
297,Joey,I get enough of that from books.
298,Ross,Books?
299,Joey,"All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it's like enough!"
300,Ross,"Well, I tell you what."
301,Ross,"Why don't we uh, why don't we just stay here?"
302,Ross,"Let's not see a movie, we'll just hang."
303,Joey,And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?
304,Ross,"Hey, if that's what you want to do I'm not gonna say no."
305,Joey,Dude!
306,Joey,What is going on?
307,Ross,I justI have to find out how it went.
308,Joey,Why?
309,Ross,This guy could be my baby's stepfather!
310,Joey,They go on one date and you're worried about them getting married?!
311,Joey,He's not you!
312,Ross,I justI-I can't believe she's-she's dating?
313,Joey,"Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?"
314,Ross,I don't know!
315,Ross,I guess I just can't believe any of this is happening.
316,Joey,What do you mean?
317,Ross,It's just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different.
318,Ross,"Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan's, it's likeIt breaks my heart a little."
319,Ross,"I mean I've always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed."
320,Ross,And we all read the paper together.
321,Ross,Y'know?
322,Ross,Maybe fight over the science section.
323,Joey,That's a nice picture.
324,Joey,Maybe you can still have that!
325,Ross,No!
326,Ross,No I can't.
327,Ross,I mean Rachel's out with some guy.
328,Ross,My baby went with her.
329,Ross,If anything that picture keeps moving further away.
330,Joey,"Hey, can I ask you something?"
331,Joey,"In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?"
332,Ross,It used to be.
333,Ross,Now she doesn't really have a face.
334,Ross,Smokin' body though.
335,Joey,Good call.
336,Joey,Yeah.
337,Joey,"But, the face Ross, the face isn't Rachel."
338,Ross,No but ahh!
339,Ross,How much easier would it be if it were?
340,Joey,"I know, but I don't think that's what she wants."
341,Ross,"No, it's not what I want either."
342,Ross,I mean I-I can't force myself to fall in love with her again now.
343,Joey,That's okay Ross maybe you need a new picture.
344,Joey,Okay?
345,Joey,"It's not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there's gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby."
346,Joey,Who cares what the picture looks like?
347,Ross,Yeah.
348,Joey,"Hey, I tell you what."
349,Joey,Let's you and me go out and have some fun.
350,Joey,Huh?
351,Joey,Whatever you want.
352,Joey,Come on!
353,Ross,We can still catch that Ukrainian film.
354,Joey,"No, I said fun!"
355,Chandler,Hey Bobby.
356,Chandler,Uhh yeah.
357,Chandler,"Yeah, it's  right, right down there."
358,Chandler,"Right there, yeah."
359,Chandler,Can I ask you why?
360,Chandler,"Okay Bob listen uhh, I'm the reason you didn't get the job up here."
361,Chandler,Bob!
362,Chandler,Well that puts me in a difficult position.
363,Monica,Hey.
364,Monica,"Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe?"
365,Monica,Oh my pleasure.
366,Monica,"Okay, I'm afraid I've got some bad news."
367,Monica,Phoebe!
368,Phoebe,Monica!
369,Monica,You're fired!
370,Phoebe,I'm breaking up with you!
371,Phoebe,"I'm, I'm breaking up with you."
372,Monica,You're fired.
373,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, I'm justI'mI'm just not ready for a relationship right now."
374,Monica,Yeah and-and I'm sorry too.
375,Monica,"But, well I justI like things done a certain way and the chemistry's just not right."
376,Phoebe,"Oh that's good, the chemistry thing for us too."
377,Monica,Tim wait!
378,Monica,"Umm, I think I spoke too quickly."
379,Monica,There-there's a learning curve with this job and maybe we can try it again.
380,Monica,Yeah.
381,Monica,Okay.
382,Phoebe,"And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here."
383,Ross,Hello.
384,Rachel,Hi!
385,Ross,"Well, how was the date?"
386,Rachel,"Well I'm alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars, what do you think?"
387,Ross,Uh-huh.
388,Ross,What happened?
389,Rachel,I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant.
390,Ross,"Ah, he didn't uh, take it so well?"
391,Rachel,"Well better than you, but y'know still not what you want."
392,Ross,Oh?
393,Rachel,"He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, ""Yeah, I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch."""
394,Ross,He sounds swell.
395,Rachel,Doesn't he?
396,Ross,"Hey, wannawanna a little cheering up?"
397,Rachel,Yes.
398,Ross,Sit down.
399,Rachel,Okay.
400,Ross,Guess whose middle name is Muriel.
401,Rachel,Chandler M. Bing?
402,Ross,Yeah-ha!
403,Rachel,Oh my God.
404,Ross,I'm sorry about your date.
405,Rachel,Oh it's all right.
406,Rachel,I'm guess I'm just done with the whole dating thing.
407,Rachel,It's one more thing in my life that's suddenly completely different.
408,Rachel,This is hard.
409,Ross,Yeah I know.
410,Ross,"On the other hand in um, in about seven months you're gonna have something that you're gonna love more than any guy you've ever gone out with."
411,Ross,Just wait.
412,Ross,"Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger."
413,Ross,You have no idea.
414,Rachel,Thanks sweetie.
415,Ross,"You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?"
416,Rachel,"Oh no, I think I'm gonna go home and eat ten candy bars."
417,Ross,"Hey, I thought I cheered you up."
418,Rachel,"Oh you did, there are twenty in here."
419,Ross,Right.
420,Ross,Good night.
421,Rachel,Good night.
422,Ross,Yeah?
423,Ross,Oh hi!

428,Ross,Great!
429,Ross,Well umm

431,Ross,"Uh, let me get it for ya."
432,Chandler,Bob.
433,Chandler,Bob!
434,Chandler,Bob!!!
435,Chandler,What the hell are you doing?
0,Chandler,"Okay, she is the star of the play."
1,Chandler,And she is my girlfriend!
2,Chandler,I get to have sex with the star of the play!
3,Ross,People can hear you.
4,Chandler,I know!
5,Chandler,Wow!
6,Chandler,She looks great.
7,Chandler,Doesn't she?
8,Ross,Yeah.
9,Ross,Kathy's Co-Star
10,Ross,That is one good looking man!
11,Chandler,"Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!"
12,Chandler,Kathy's Co-Star
13,Ross,Dude!
14,Ross,Kathy's Co-Star
15,Ross,Here's your girlfriend's button.
16,Ross,Opening Credits
17,Phoebe,"Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?"
18,Monica,"Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere."
19,Monica,Why?
20,Phoebe,"Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive."
21,Monica,"Hey, Rach!"
22,Monica,I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room.
23,Monica,If you could justthrow your purses at it.
24,Rachel,Bloomingdale's eliminated my department.
25,Monica,"Oh my God, are you out of a job?"
26,Rachel,"No, but they stuck me in personal shopping."
27,Rachel,Which is just a huge step down!
28,Phoebe,Personal shopping?
29,Phoebe,What is that?
30,Phoebe,Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
31,Rachel,Uh-huh.
32,Phoebe,That sounds great!
33,Joey,Hey!
34,Monica,"Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments."
35,Monica,"You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended."
36,Joey,There's gravy?
37,Monica,If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time.
38,Monica,"That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now."
39,Monica,What are you doing?
40,Joey,I think I left a donut up here.
41,Ross,Hey!
42,Phoebe,Hey!
43,Joey,Hey!
44,Phoebe,Ooh!
45,Phoebe,How was Kathy's play?
46,Ross,"Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin' guy."
47,Chandler,"Yeah, it's like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!"
48,Phoebe,That's a good idea for a business!
49,Chandler,I'm totally screwed.
50,Chandler,"Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me."
51,Chandler,"Y'know it'll be like, ""So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?"""
52,Chandler,"And she'll go, ""No-no-no, it's Chandler."""
53,Chandler,"And he'll go, ""Whatever."
54,Chandler,"Ha-ha-ha-ha!"""
55,Joey,That-that is a good trick.
56,Chandler,"All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?"
57,Joey,"Chandler, look they're actors."
58,Joey,"They're there to do a job, just cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together."
59,Joey,"I mean just cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them."
60,Ross,"Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger."
61,Joey,Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
62,Ross,Yeah.
63,Phoebe,"Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood."
64,Ross,They're not a couple!
65,Phoebe,"Oh-okay, I get the game now."
66,Joey,"Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?"
67,Ross,Oh yeah!
68,Joey,"Well okay, so then you're fine."
69,Joey,The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone.
70,Joey,Okay?
71,Joey,So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about.
72,Joey,"It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble."
73,Chandler,Really?
74,Joey,"Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?"
75,Ross,No.
76,Joey,Noooo!
77,Chandler,"So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?"
78,Ross,"Y'know what, I don't know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend."
79,Chandler,"Yeah, I know but"
80,Ross,"Oh no-no-no, I'm there."
81,Monica,Hey!
82,Joey,Hey Mon!
83,Joey,Want some pancakes?
84,Monica,You made pancakes?
85,Joey,Yep!
86,Joey,Grab a plate.
87,Monica,Okay.
88,Joey,"No-no, stay right there."
89,Joey,Gettin' closer.
90,Chandler,"Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades."
91,Chandler,Which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.
92,Joey,"Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over."
93,Ross,Oh yeah!
94,Monica,"Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game."
95,Joey,"Oh yeah, who's playing?"
96,Monica,The players.
97,Ross,Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
98,Monica,"Please, it's a relief is what it is, is what it is."
99,Joey,"All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!"
100,Phoebe,Oh.
101,Rachel,"Monica, I'm quitting!"
102,Rachel,I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it!
103,Rachel,I'm telling you I'm quitting!
104,Rachel,That's it!
105,Rachel,I'm talking to my boss right now!
106,Rachel,Yes I am!
107,Rachel,Yes I am!
108,Rachel,Yes I am!
109,Rachel,Yes I am!
110,Rachel,Yes I am!
111,Rachel,Yes I am!
112,Rachel,"Okay bye, call me when you get this message."
113,Rachel,Oh!
114,Rachel,"Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you."
115,Rachel,Mr.
116,Rachel,Hi!
117,Rachel,"Hi, I'm Rachel Green."
118,Rachel,What can I do for you Joshua?
119,Rachel,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
120,Rachel,"Well, at least that's a great suit."
121,Rachel,Okay.
122,Rachel,Mr.
123,Rachel,"No-no, that wasn't me!"
124,Rachel,"Well, we should get started."
125,Rachel,Let me show you my underwear.
126,Rachel,The selection of underwear we carry.
127,Rachel,"Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way."
128,Chandler,I'm right!
129,Chandler,Right?
130,Chandler,There was like no chemistry between them.
131,Chandler,"Before they had heat, and now there's no heat!"
132,Chandler,"Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!"
133,Ross,"All right, let's not jump to any conclusions."
134,Ross,All right?
135,Ross,There was some sexual chemistry between them.
136,Chandler,"Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!"
137,Ross,Here she comes.
138,Ross,"Don't say a word, okay?"
139,Ross,"Just be cool, don't bey'know you."
140,Ross,Hey!
141,Ross,"Oh, absolutely!"
142,Chandler,"Oh, I loved the play."
143,Chandler,"You were great, and Nick ditto."
144,Chandler,Clearly you're having sex with him.
145,Ross,"Okay, I"
146,Chandler,"Oh come on, it was so obvious!"
147,Chandler,There was no chemistry between you two!
148,Chandler,"Y'know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing."
149,Chandler,"Well, you can understand, given how we started."
150,Chandler,"Well, that is what happened, and I don't even see you denying this!"
151,Chandler,"Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen anytime soon!"
152,Chandler,Commercial Break
153,Rachel,I have the best job in the entire world!
154,Rachel,"The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!"
155,Phoebe,Rachel has a new doll.
156,Rachel,"Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises."
157,Rachel,Oh!
158,Rachel,"And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua!"
159,Rachel,Josh-u-a!
160,Rachel,Joshua!
161,Rachel,Josh.
162,Ross,"Uh, hello!"
163,Rachel,Hi-e!
164,Phoebe,"Ooh, what do I smell?"
165,Joey,"I don't know, it smells good."
166,Monica,Fresh cookies!
167,Monica,Hot from the oven!
168,Phoebe,Ooh!
169,Monica,"Please, have some!"
170,Ross,"Oh, yumm!"
171,Monica,"Yeah, I've just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone."
172,Joey,Wow!
173,Joey,The new Playboy!
174,Monica,"Yeah, it's just something I picked up."
175,Ross,"Cookies and porn, you're the best mom ever!"
176,Phoebe,What?
177,Phoebe,What?
178,Rachel,"Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there."
179,Ross,"Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?"
180,Rachel,It's Joshua.
181,Ross,"Oh, whatever."
182,Monica,Wait!
183,Monica,Wait!
184,Monica,This isn't take-out!
185,Phoebe,"Well, I hate to eat and run, but"
186,Monica,"No, wait, please don't go!"
187,Monica,I've got porn for you too!
188,Phoebe,"Yeah, I don't need it."
189,Monica,People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
190,Rachel,Why?
191,Rachel,"Honey, what is the big deal?"
192,Monica,I'm the hostess!
193,Monica,Not those guys!
194,Monica,I'm always the hostess!
195,Monica,"I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air."
196,Phoebe,"Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?"
197,Monica,"Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them."
198,Monica,But I'm-I'm done now.
199,Monica,They've suffered enough.
200,Phoebe,"If you wanted to punish them, you should've just made them hang out here!"
201,Rachel,"Yeah, that's true."
202,Monica,"All right then, when I'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place!"
203,Phoebe,"Oh, are we gonna trash that place?"
204,Chandler,Steps!
205,Chandler,Slut!
206,Chandler,You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
207,Ross,So you were right?
208,Chandler,"I confronted her, and she didn't deny it!"
209,Chandler,I don't live here!
210,Ross,Chandler!
211,Rachel,"Chandler, what did she say?"
212,Phoebe,Wait a minute.
213,Joey,Come here.
214,Monica,Are you sure?
215,Chandler,"Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said!"
216,Chandler,Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie's
217,Rachel,Beefsteak Charlie's?
218,Chandler,Yes!
219,Chandler,See you and I have always been like
220,Rachel,Whoops.
221,Rachel,"Oh, hey, do you need help with that?"
222,Monica,"Nah, I got it."
223,Rachel,"Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum."
224,Rachel,Hi!
225,Rachel,"So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out."
226,Rachel,It's just so frustrating!
227,Phoebe,Why don't you ask him out?
228,Joey,"Oh, yeah, totally!"
229,Joey,That's such a turn-on!
230,Rachel,Really?
231,Rachel,It doesn't seem desperate?
232,Joey,"Oh-ooh, that's the turn-on."
233,Phoebe,He just got a divorce right?
234,Rachel,Hmm-mmm.
235,Phoebe,"So he's probably really nervous around women, y'know?"
236,Phoebe,"Maybe, you just have to make the first move."
237,Rachel,"Yeah but, I've never asked a guy out before."
238,Phoebe,You've never asked a guy out?!
239,Rachel,No.
240,Rachel,Have you?
241,Phoebe,Thousands of times!!
242,Phoebe,That doesn't make me sound too good does it?
243,Rachel,I don't even know how I would go about it.
244,Joey,"Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, ""Hey, how you doin'?"""
245,Phoebe,"Oh, please!"
246,Joey,"Hey, how you doin'?"
247,Rachel,"You know what, I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna call him up, and I'm gonna ask him out."
248,Rachel,I can do that.
249,Rachel,Ask him out.
250,Rachel,How you doin'?
251,Rachel,Hi!
252,Rachel,Joshua?
253,Rachel,It's Rachel Green from Bloomingdale's.
254,Rachel,"Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today?"
255,Rachel,"Well, we found a wallet, and we the license?"
256,Rachel,"Well, that is a good idea!"
257,Rachel,"Uh, well, let's see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home."
258,Rachel,I'll see you tomorrow.
259,Rachel,Bye.
260,Rachel,You've done that a thousand times?
261,Phoebe,I've never done that.
262,Rachel,"Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no."
263,Joey,"Well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too."
264,Joey,"Like uh, Knicks tickets!"
265,Joey,"Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes!"
266,Rachel,Really?!
267,Rachel,You think that will work?
268,Joey,Absolutely!
269,Joey,"And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?"
270,Joey,What the heck is that?
271,Chandler,Did she call?
272,Phoebe,"No, sorry."
273,Chandler,"All right, maybe I should call her."
274,Joey,No!
275,Joey,"Forget her, man!"
276,Joey,"You don't need her, you don't need that!"
277,Ross,"He's right, what she did was unforgivable."
278,Chandler,"Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?"
279,Ross,How might you be wrong?
280,Chandler,"Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?"
281,Joey,"Dude, tell me she actually told you this."
282,Chandler,"She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat."
283,Chandler,"Back me up here, Ross!"
284,Ross,That's all you're basing this on?
285,Chandler,That's not backing me up!
286,Chandler,"Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat."
287,Joey,"Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory!"
288,Joey,There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out.
289,Joey,The lone gunman.
290,Joey,Communism.
291,Joey,Geometry.
292,Chandler,Oh my God!
293,Rachel,Would you like to go to a basketball game with me?
294,Rachel,"You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too  Umm, who likes the Knicks"
295,Rachel,Oh!
296,Rachel,"Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!"
297,Rachel,Yep.
298,Rachel,"Oh, yeah, look you great."
299,Rachel,Oh yeah.
300,Rachel,"Yeah, this looks great."
301,Rachel,"Umm, so you like it?"
302,Rachel,Great.
303,Rachel,Sure.
304,Rachel,Yeah-eah-ha!
305,Rachel,"Oh well, you don't want to do that now?"
306,Rachel,Okay.
307,Rachel,Basketball!
308,Rachel,"I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you're interested, just as a thank you for this week."
309,Rachel,Really?
310,Chandler,Hey.
311,Chandler,"I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I'm sorry."
312,Chandler,Y'know?
313,Chandler,"I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset."
314,Chandler,"Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y'know I-I think this is a good thing."
315,Chandler,Y'know?
316,Chandler,"Cause we've had our first fight, and now we can move on."
317,Chandler,"Y'know, I know for me Nick's pants?"
318,Chandler,Yeah.
319,Chandler,"Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!"
320,Joey,"Okay, for next time, what do you say?"
321,Rachel,I have an extra ticket.
322,Rachel,An extra ticket.
323,Rachel,"Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket."
324,Ross,"So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?"
325,Rachel,He didn't turn me down!
326,Rachel,He's at the game isn't he?
327,Rachel,"I got the date, I'm just not on it!"
328,Monica,"Okay, it's ready."
329,Monica,Come on.
330,Joey,What's ready?
331,Monica,Just come.
332,Ross,Oh my God!
333,Rachel,Wow!
334,Rachel,Monica!
335,Phoebe,Great!
336,Ross,This is beautiful!
337,Phoebe,Oh did youwhat did youdid you work for two days straight?
338,Monica,Pretty much.
339,Monica,"So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?"
340,Joey,"I don't know, it looks the same."
341,Monica,You used to have carpet.
342,Joey,Oh yeah!
343,Monica,So I made snacks.
344,Monica,"Please, just hang out okay?"
345,Monica,I'm just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.
346,Ross,"Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?"
347,Monica,"Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking."
348,Monica,I'm always the hostess.
349,Ross,Hey!
350,Joey,How'd it go?
351,Chandler,"Well, she wasn't sleeping with him."
352,Phoebe,Oh good!
353,Chandler,She is now.
354,Ross,What are you saying?
355,Chandler,I'm saying that she is a devil woman!
356,Chandler,Y'know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick!
357,Chandler,"Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples!"
358,Chandler,"I hate him, I hate her!"
359,Chandler,"Well, I don't hate her, I love her."
360,Chandler,This is all my fault really.
361,Phoebe,How?
362,Phoebe,How is your fault?
363,Chandler,"Because, I-I should've called!"
364,Chandler,"Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together."
365,Chandler,I threw her at his man nipples!
366,Rachel,"Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone."
367,Ross,"Well, if-if she thought they were on a break  Closing Credits"
368,Rachel,Really?
369,Rachel,Mr.
370,Rachel,Yes!
371,Rachel,I will!
372,Rachel,Absolutely!
373,Rachel,"Hello, Rachel."
374,Rachel,"Hi, Joshua."
375,Rachel,I left my wallet here on purpose.
376,Rachel,Really?
377,Rachel,"Yes, I just wanted to see you again."
378,Rachel,"Oh, I'm glad."
379,Rachel,"Rachel, I'd like to say something to you."
380,Rachel,Yes?
381,Rachel,How you doin'?
382,Rachel,End
0,Ross,I Ross...
1,Ross,"Take thee, Rachel... Emily."
2,Ross,Emily.
3,Rachel,"He-he said Rachel, right?"
4,Rachel,Do you think I should go up there?
5,Ross,"I, Ross"
6,Ross,"Take thee,  Emily."
7,Ross,Like there'd be anybody else.
8,Ross,"As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us."
9,Ross,"Really, I do."
10,Ross,Emily.
11,Ross,Happy too.
12,Ross,Yay!
13,Ross,Okay.
14,Joey,"Well, that went well."
15,Joey,Yeah.
16,Chandler,"It could've been worse, he could've shot her."
17,Ross,"That uh, that was pretty funny."
18,Ross,Wasn't it?
19,Ross,Opening Credits
20,Joey,"Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?"
21,Ross,"That-that-that's all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie."
22,Ross,I'll be right out here.
23,Ross,She's just fixing her makeup.
24,Ross,"And, I love you!!"
25,Ross,Mr.
26,Ross,"That's true, thanks dad."
27,Ross,People should be dancing!
28,Ross,Huh?
29,Ross,"Hey, this is a party!"
30,Ross,Come on!
31,Ross,"Joey, dance!!"
32,Ross,Mrs.
33,Phoebe,"Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange."
34,Phoebe,Mrs.
35,Phoebe,"Yeah, I've discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women's names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own."
36,Phoebe,Mrs.
37,Phoebe,"No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange."
38,Phoebe,Oh no!
39,Phoebe,You have it too!
40,Phoebe,Hello?
41,Chandler,Hey.
42,Monica,Hey.
43,Chandler,"Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship."
44,Monica,I know.
45,Monica,How could we have let this happen?
46,Chandler,Seven times!
47,Monica,Ugh!
48,Monica,"Well, y'know, we were away"
49,Chandler,"In a foreign, romantic country"
50,Monica,I blame London.
51,Chandler,Bad London!
52,Monica,"So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?"
53,Chandler,"Well, I don't see that we have a choice."
54,Chandler,"But, when we're back home, we don't do it."
55,Monica,Only here.
56,Chandler,"Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs"
57,Monica,I'll meet you there in two minutes.
58,Chandler,Okay!
59,Rachel,"Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something."
60,Monica,Now?
61,Rachel,"Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?"
62,Monica,"Oh, I-I don't know."
63,Rachel,"Monica, what should I do?"
64,Monica,"Just uh, do the right thing."
65,Rachel,What?
66,Monica,Toe the line.
67,Monica,Thread the needle.
68,Monica,Think outside the box!
69,Rachel,"Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant."
70,Monica,Wait.
71,Monica,"Rachel, no, he's married."
72,Monica,Married!
73,Monica,"If you don't realize that, I can't help you."
74,Rachel,"Okay, you're right."
75,Rachel,You're right.
76,Rachel,You can't help me.
77,Rachel,Mrs.
78,Joey,"Hey, what's up?"
79,Monica,Where were you?
80,Monica,We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
81,Chandler,"Forget it, that's off."
82,Monica,Why?!
83,Monica,Mr.
84,Monica,"Joey, what are you doing?"
85,Monica,You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
86,Joey,"Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count."
87,Monica,That's true.
88,Chandler,The man's got a point.
89,Rachel,"Oh, hi!"
90,Ross,Hi!
91,Rachel,Hi.
92,Rachel,"Sorry, things aren't working out so well."
93,Ross,Oh no!
94,Ross,"It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right?"
95,Rachel,Oh yeah!
96,Rachel,"Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know?"
97,Rachel,"I mean, so you said my name!"
98,Rachel,"Y'know you just said it cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, ""I take thee circus freak."""
99,Rachel,"Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake."
100,Rachel,It didn't mean anything.
101,Rachel,Right?
102,Ross,No!
103,Ross,No!
104,Ross,Of course it didn't mean anything!
105,Ross,"I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you"
106,Rachel,Right
107,Ross,But it absolutely didn't.
108,Ross,It didn't!!
109,Ross,It didn't!
110,Joey,"Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so"
111,Ross,Oh!
112,Ross,"Oh-oh, the band's ready!"
113,Ross,"Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band saysI don't care about the stupid band!"
114,Joey,You spit on me man!
115,Ross,"Look, I'm sorry."
116,Joey,"Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?"
117,Rachel,"Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame."
118,Ross,"Oh, right!"
119,Rachel,"Get the hell out of there, y'know?"
120,Ross,Emily?
121,Ross,Emily?
122,Ross,I'm coming in.
123,Rachel,"Well, look at that, same thing."
124,Chandler,"Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, ""Yippee!"""
125,Chandler,just ignore me.
126,Monica,"Oh my God, Rachel!"
127,Monica,Hi!
128,Chandler,"Oh, hello Rachel."
129,Rachel,Ross said my name.
130,Rachel,Okay?
131,Rachel,My name.
132,Rachel,Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!
133,Rachel,"Okay, don't believe me, I know I'm rightdo you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?"
134,Chandler,"Yes, we do."
135,Chandler,"But, we have to change first."
136,Monica,"Yes, I want to change."
137,Monica,And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
138,Chandler,"Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes."
139,Monica,Fifteen minutes.
140,Rachel,Okay.
141,Rachel,Hello?
142,Rachel,"Oh, Pheebs!"
143,Rachel,It's Phoebe!
144,Chandler,"Oh, yay"
145,Monica,Great
146,Rachel,Hi!
147,Phoebe,"Hi, so what happened?"
148,Rachel,"Well, Ross said my name."
149,Phoebe,"Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything."
150,Rachel,"Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right?"
151,Rachel,"Ninth grade, right?"
152,Rachel,The obsession starts.
153,Rachel,All right?
154,Rachel,"The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow."
155,Rachel,So then
156,Chandler,"Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?"
157,Monica,But my clothes areohh!
158,Chandler,"Wow, you look"
159,Monica,No time for that!
160,Joey,"Hey, dude, let me in."
161,Joey,I got a girl out here!
162,Chandler,"Well, I've got a girl in here."
163,Joey,"No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!"
164,Chandler,"Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!"
165,Joey,"Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?"
166,Chandler,"Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!!"
167,Chandler,"But, what if we're watching a movie in here?"
168,Monica,"Which we are, and-and we already paid for it."
169,Monica,It's My Giant!
170,Joey,My Giant?
171,Joey,I love that movie!
172,Monica,You really think this is okay?
173,Chandler,"Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it."
174,Monica,"Oh, it's so beautiful."
175,Monica,Ohh!
176,Monica,"Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this."
177,Chandler,"Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite."
178,Chandler,The room expects sex.
179,Chandler,The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex.
180,Chandler,All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
181,Monica,Okay!
182,Chandler,Okay!
183,Ross,Emily?
184,Chandler,"Nope, not under here!"
185,Monica,You didn't find her?
186,Ross,"No, I've looked everywhere!"
187,Chandler,"Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!"
188,Monica,"Yeah, I think you should keep looking!"
189,Chandler,"Yeah, for about 30 minutes."
190,Monica,Or 45.
191,Chandler,"Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice."
192,Ross,No!
193,Ross,"For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around."
194,Ross,"No, from now on, I'm staying in one place."
195,Ross,Right here.
196,Monica,"Well, it's getting late."
197,Chandler,"Yeah, we're gonna go."
198,Ross,"Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?"
199,Monica,"Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York."
200,Chandler,"Yeah, it's a very large plane."
201,Ross,That's cool.
202,Chandler,"But, we'll stay here with you."
203,Ross,Thanks guys!
204,Ross,"I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt."
205,Ross,Commercial Break
206,Chandler,We have to leave for New York in an hour.
207,Monica,"I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?"
208,Chandler,We can't do that that's insane.
209,Chandler,"I mean A' he could wake up and B' y'know, let's go for it."
210,Ross,Em-Emily?
211,Ross,Em-Emily?
212,Ross,Emily!
213,Ross,Mr.
214,Ross,"Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?"
215,Ross,Mr.
216,Rachel,"Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside  Mr."
217,Ross,"Now, hold on!"
218,Ross,Hold on!
219,Ross,"Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too!"
220,Ross,"Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay?"
221,Ross,She's-she's just a friend and that's all!
222,Ross,That's all!
223,Ross,Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else.
224,Ross,"Please, promise me that you'll tell her that."
225,Ross,Mr.
226,Monica,"Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again."
227,Chandler,"Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special."
228,Chandler,"Y'know, technically we still are over international waters."
229,Monica,"I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?"
230,Chandler,Kay!
231,Joey,Can I ask you something?
232,Chandler,"Uhh, no."
233,Joey,"Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, ""I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant."""
234,Joey,Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
235,Chandler,No.
236,Joey,"I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?"
237,Chandler,Yes.
238,Joey,Thanks man.
239,Chandler,Okay man.
240,Joey,But what about how much taller he is than me?
241,Joey,"I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know?"
242,Joey,"And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?"
243,Joey,"Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour."
244,Monica,I know!
245,Joey,"Had the beef-tips, huh?"
246,Phoebe,Hey!
247,Chandler,Hey!
248,Joey,Hi!
249,Phoebe,You ate meat!
250,Phoebe,You had sex!
251,Chandler,No we didn't!
252,Phoebe,"I know you didn't, I was talking about Monica."
253,Monica,"Phoebe, I did not have sex."
254,Phoebe,This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
255,Joey,"All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck."
256,Phoebe,"Oh, me too!"
257,Joey,"Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?"
258,Phoebe,"Oh right, maybe I'll just go home."
259,Monica,"Well, we certainly are alone."
260,Chandler,Yes!
261,Chandler,"Good thing we have that, Not in New York' rule."
262,Monica,Right.
263,Monica,"Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother"
264,Chandler,Right.
265,Monica,"Well, an-anyway, I justthat night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks."
266,Chandler,Oh.
267,Chandler,"Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me cause, you're really hot!"
268,Chandler,Is that okay?
269,Monica,That's okay.
270,Chandler,And I'm cute too.
271,Monica,And you're cute too.
272,Chandler,Thank you!
273,Chandler,"All right, I gotta go unpack."
274,Monica,Okay.
275,Chandler,Bye.
276,Chandler,"I'm still on London time, does that count?"
277,Monica,That counts!
278,Chandler,"Oh, good!"
279,Ross,Rach!
280,Ross,Rach!
281,Rachel,Hi!
282,Ross,Hi!
283,Ross,"What are you, what are you doing here?"
284,Rachel,"Well, I-I-I've been on Standby for a flight home for hours."
285,Ross,Oh.
286,Rachel,"Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?"
287,Ross,Not yet.
288,Rachel,"So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?"
289,Rachel,Gate
290,Ross,Pretty soon I guess.
291,Rachel,Yeah.
292,Rachel,I'm sorry.
293,Ross,"I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this?"
294,Ross,"Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?"
295,Rachel,"No, you're not an idiot, Ross."
296,Rachel,You're a guy very much in love.
297,Ross,Same difference.
298,Ross,Gate
299,Ross,I get it!
300,Ross,"Well, that's that."
301,Rachel,"No, you know what, I think you should go."
302,Ross,What?
303,Rachel,"Yeah, I do."
304,Rachel,"I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good."
305,Ross,"Oh, I don't, I don't, I don't know"
306,Rachel,"Oh, come on Ross!"
307,Rachel,I think it would be really good for you!
308,Ross,"I could, yeah, I can do that."
309,Rachel,Yeah.
310,Ross,"I can't, I can't even believe her!"
311,Ross,"No, y'know what, I am, I am gonna go!"
312,Rachel,Good!
313,Ross,"I know, why not?"
314,Rachel,Right!
315,Ross,Right?
316,Rachel,Right!
317,Ross,Y'knowthanks!
318,Rachel,"Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here."
319,Ross,"Yeah, wellnah."
320,Rachel,What?
321,Rachel,"Wait, what?"
322,Ross,"Why don't you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?"
323,Rachel,"Well-well, I don't know Rossreally?"
324,Ross,"Yeah, yeah, it'll be great!"
325,Ross,"You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage."
326,Ross,See-see how I make jokes?
327,Rachel,Uh-huh.
328,Ross,"No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend."
329,Rachel,"Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe."
330,Rachel,"Umm, yes, I can do that!"
331,Ross,Okay!
332,Rachel,Okay!
333,Ross,Cool!

343,Ross,You tell them to wait!
344,Rachel,Okay.
345,Rachel,Wait!
346,Rachel,Wait!
347,Ross,Emily.
348,Ross,Oh no-no-no!

357,Rachel,"Hey, are we moving?!"
358,Rachel,Are we moving?
359,Rachel,Why are we moving?
360,Rachel,"Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the captain know that we're moving?"

4,Joey,"yeah, I can't do that!"
5,Chandler,What are you doin'?
6,Ross,Have you seen this?
7,Ross,It's a new alumni website for college!
8,Ross,It's cool!
9,Ross,"You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to."
10,Chandler,"Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless ."
11,Ross,It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?
12,Chandler,The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
13,Ross,"Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident..."
14,Chandler,Bet she'd sleep with you now...
15,Ross,No...
16,Ross,I already e-mailed her.
17,Chandler,Let me see what you wrote about
18,Ross,You know what?
19,Ross,"I'm gonna finish this later, ok?"
20,Ross,Let me just grab my coat.
21,Joey,Hey!
22,Ross,What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes?
23,Chandler,Maybe we finish this for him!
24,Chandler,"""Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab."
25,Chandler,She's now my girlfriend.
26,Chandler,I don't care what society says.
27,Chandler,"It's the best sex I've ever had""... aaand SEND!"
28,Joey,"No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!"
29,Ross,"Alright, let's go!"
30,Joey,Dude!

32,Joey,aaand SEND!
33,Joey,Opening credits
34,Rachel,Hey!
35,Rachel,How was basketball?
36,Joey,"Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!"
37,Rachel,"Oh, no!"
38,Rachel,Who did that?
39,Joey,Chandler... hey...  Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma?
40,Rachel,"She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him."
41,Rachel,That's all right?
42,Rachel,Isn't it?
43,Joey,"Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults..."
44,Joey,I know that!
45,Rachel,Joey... are you sure?
46,Rachel,"I mean, I know how much you love him!"
47,Joey,"Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok?"
48,Joey,I do not love Hugsy.
49,Joey,I like him a normal amount...
50,Rachel,"All right... Oh, Emma loves him!"
51,Joey,Why wouldn't she?
52,Joey,He's a wonderful person!
53,Phoebe,Hi.
54,Monica,Hey Phoebe... how you doin'?
55,Monica,You feelin' better?
56,Phoebe,Breaking up sucks!
57,Phoebe,"Oh, I really miss Mike!"
58,Chandler,"Oh, I'm so sorry!"
59,Phoebe,"Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better."
60,Phoebe,I even tried writing a song about it... but...
61,Phoebe,I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!!
62,Phoebe,"Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this..."
63,Chandler,You're not gonna need my help?
64,Phoebe,"Well no, when I get to the point where... you know..."
65,Phoebe,I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike...
66,Phoebe,I'm gonna come to you.
67,Chandler,"Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4!"
68,Chandler,I've just thought of a fourth
69,Phoebe,Ok.
70,Phoebe,I mean I know I did the right thing.
71,Phoebe,"You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much."
72,Phoebe,I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.
73,Monica,"Ok, you got it!"
74,Phoebe,"Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun."
75,Phoebe,You know what?
76,Phoebe,Forget what I said.
77,Monica,Really?
78,Monica,If that's what you want...
79,Phoebe,That was a test and you just failed.
80,Monica,Damn it!
81,Monica,Rookie mistake!
82,Ross,I have sex with dinosaurs?
83,Chandler,I believe I read that somewhere!
84,Ross,"That only is not funny, it's physically impossible!"
85,Ross,Ok?
86,Ross,Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...
87,Ross,It's not funny!
88,Chandler,I respectfully disagree.
89,Ross,I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
90,Chandler,Who cares?
91,Chandler,Nobody reads those things
92,Ross,You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
93,Chandler,I don't have a page.
94,Ross,Oh oh oh!
95,Ross,I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!
96,Joey,"Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...  with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya."
97,Joey,"It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep."
98,Joey,"It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me."
99,Joey,Put down the scrunchy.
100,Rachel,What are you doing?
101,Joey,"Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy."
102,Rachel,"Oh, oh thanks."
103,Rachel,"Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom."
104,Joey,There you go sweetie...
105,Joey,This isn't over.
106,Monica,"Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as...   ""gay as the day is long""?"
107,Chandler,Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
108,Monica,But that's clearly a joke.
109,Monica,This could easily be true.
110,Chandler,Would you get that please?
111,Chandler,People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
112,Monica,Hello?
113,Monica,"No, he's not here."
114,Monica,"Yeah, this is his wife."
115,Monica,"Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too."
116,Monica,I guess I should have known.
117,Monica,"Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge."
118,Chandler,"Hang up, hang up."
119,Chandler,And that was a great movie!
120,Chandler,"I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go ."
121,Monica,What are you doing?
122,Chandler,"Oh, you'll see my friend."
123,Ross,I'm dead?
124,Chandler,And so young.
125,Ross,Posting that I died?
126,Ross,That really isn't funny.
127,Chandler,"Well, how you died was funny."
128,Ross,"Oh please, hit by a blimp?"
129,Chandler,It kills over one americans every year.
130,Ross,"Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls."
131,Ross,You're messing with people's feelings here.
132,Chandler,You wanna talk about people's feelings?
133,Chandler,You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
134,Ross,"You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn."
135,Ross,That's right!
136,Ross,Your coming out is about to get real graphic.
137,Phoebe,"God, I wish Mike were here."
138,Monica,Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?
139,Monica,"What are you, animals?"
140,Monica,It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!
141,Phoebe,I gotta call him.
142,Phoebe,"Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that."
143,Monica,"Phoebe, that's how it starts."
144,Monica,"I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two."
145,Monica,"And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide."
146,Monica,"Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard."
147,Monica,"Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him."
148,Monica,"And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him."
149,Monica,I know that's not what you want.
150,Monica,Give me your phone.
151,Phoebe,Here.
152,Monica,And now your cell.
153,Phoebe,Okay
154,Monica,This is your cellphone?
155,Phoebe,Yes.
156,Monica,This is your current cellphone?
157,Phoebe,"Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time."
158,Monica,"Phoebe, where's your purse?"
159,Monica,"No, no!"
160,Monica,Give it to me!
161,Phoebe,You can't have it.
162,Monica,Give it to me!
163,Phoebe,No
164,Monica,I'll go in there.
165,Phoebe,Oh yeah.
166,Monica,Phoebe come here
167,Monica,Haha!
168,Phoebe,Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
169,Joey,"Hey, look who's here!"
170,Joey,"It's Joey, and he brought home a friend."
171,Rachel,"Joey, Emma's right here!"
172,Rachel,You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.
173,Joey,"No, no, it's not a girl, it's...  a brand new Hugsy!"
174,Rachel,"Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's."
175,Joey,"No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh?"
176,Joey,"The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back."
177,Rachel,Oh you know what?
178,Rachel,When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton.
179,Rachel,"Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail..."
180,Joey,Make the transfer!
181,Rachel,Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?
182,Joey,"Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago."
183,Rachel,"Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy."
184,Joey,But he's the same.
185,Rachel,"Yeah, I think she wants the old one back."
186,Joey,But he's the same.
187,Rachel,"Joey, come on!"
188,Joey,He's the same!
189,Joey,You're not the same!
190,Monica,Haha!
191,Phoebe,"You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building."
192,Monica,"So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door."
193,Phoebe,Those are my shoes.
194,Monica,"Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping."
195,Phoebe,"Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better."
196,Phoebe,"Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now."
197,Monica,Who's that?
198,Phoebe,I ordered Chinese food.
199,Phoebe,What are the chances?
200,Phoebe,1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!
201,Monica,What are you doing here?
202,Monica,Phoebe!
203,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, I broke down..."
204,Phoebe,I wanted to see him.
205,Monica,Damnit Phoebe!
206,Monica,How did you even call him?
207,Phoebe,There is a speakerphone on the base unit...
208,Monica,Base Unit!
209,Monica,Think Monica!
210,Monica,Think!
211,Monica,This doesn't concern you!
212,Monica,"Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder."
213,Phoebe,Not if nothing happens.
214,Phoebe,Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?
215,Monica,Sure!
216,Monica,"If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya."
217,Monica,"You know, I'm your friend  and Mike's friend ."
218,Phoebe,Sit down.
219,Monica,Oh wow wow wow!!
220,Monica,Make room for your friend!
221,Monica,I've been pretty good!
222,Phoebe,"Thanks, you look good too."
223,Monica,Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory.
224,Monica,Keep it clean!
225,Phoebe,So how's the piano playing going?
226,Phoebe,I've missed you too.
227,Monica,"You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up."
228,Monica,And then a pigeon ate it!
229,Chandler,"Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?"
230,Ross,"uhu uhu, check this out."
231,Chandler,Huh!
232,Chandler,So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman.
233,Chandler,You're not actually going to send these out are ya?
234,Ross,"Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little ""Ross is dead"" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses."
235,Ross,"Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you."
236,Ross,"Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead."
237,Ross,Oh my God!
238,Ross,Nobody cares that I'm dead!
239,Chandler,"No, come on, you know that's not true."
240,Ross,What are you talking about?
241,Ross,You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet!
242,Ross,I didn't get one response!
243,Ross,And I'm dead!
244,Chandler,"Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community."
245,Ross,I can't believe this.
246,Ross,Not even my geology lab partner?
247,Ross,And I carried that guy!
248,Chandler,"Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time?"
249,Chandler,That people are gonna post condolences on a website?
250,Chandler,This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
251,Ross,You're right.
252,Ross,There isn't a decent outlet.
253,Chandler,"Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come."
254,Ross,Exactly!
255,Chandler,"Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing?"
256,Chandler,You're having a memorial service for yourself!
257,Ross,No!
258,Ross,That would be stupid!
259,Ross,You're having it for me!
260,Chandler,"Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !"
261,Ross,"oh, too late, too late!"
262,Ross,It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...
263,Rachel,"I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?"
264,Joey,Original or crappy?
265,Rachel,Original.
266,Joey,"No, sorry haven't seen him."
267,Rachel,Then what's that big lump under your covers?
268,Joey,"It's Monica, ok?"
269,Rachel,That's not Monica!
270,Joey,Alright!!
271,Joey,Fine!
272,Joey,It's original Hugsy!
273,Joey,"No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him.."
274,Rachel,Oh God.
275,Joey,... she's being unreasonable!
276,Rachel,"Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much  Oh don't cover its ears!"
277,Rachel,It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!
278,Joey,It does?
279,Rachel,Yeah!
280,Rachel,And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.
281,Joey,Really?
282,Joey,She... she loves me?
283,Rachel,Oh yeah!
284,Rachel,But you know what?
285,Rachel,"If you need Hugsy, don't worry."
286,Rachel,Emma will totally understand.
287,Rachel,I won't... but whatever .
288,Joey,"Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... ."
289,Joey,If Hugsy means that much to Emma then...  well she can have him.
290,Rachel,"Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up."
291,Rachel,"Look Emma, look who's baaack!"
292,Joey,Look forget it forget it...
293,Joey,I can't do it.
294,Rachel,Are you gonna...  you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?
295,Joey,How do you think I got him in the first place?
296,Monica,"Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom."
297,Monica,Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone.
298,Monica,Here's a few things you can
299,Phoebe,"I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?"
300,Monica,"Kiss him, you fool!"
301,Phoebe,What?
302,Monica,Didn't you hear that speech?
303,Monica,If you don't kiss him then I will!
304,Phoebe,"Oh, I missed you so much!"
305,Phoebe,Strange
306,Phoebe,Who is this?
307,Monica,"Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!"
308,Monica,Excuse me?
309,Monica,"Hey, at least I knew where my guy was."
310,Monica,You didn't hear the speech!
311,Monica,"Hey, it was very moving!"
312,Monica,You're just heartless!
313,Monica,You're... weird!
314,Monica,Oh !
315,Monica,Damn it!
316,Monica,And I blame you too.
317,Ross,It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up!
318,Ross,"I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!"
319,Chandler,There you go!
320,Chandler,Someone came!
321,Ross,"Ok, ok!"
322,Ross,I'm gonna go hide!
323,Ross,"Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!"
324,Monica,"Hi, glad you could come."
325,Chandler,"Please, come in."
326,Chandler,"Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat."
327,Chandler,At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps
328,Ross,Who is he?
329,Chandler,"Some guy, Tom Gordon."
330,Ross,"I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives."
331,Monica,"So, did you know Ross well?"
332,Monica,"Yes, he is."
333,Monica,Me.
334,Chandler,"Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you!"
335,Chandler,"Here we go, bye bye!"
336,Chandler,Ok!
337,Ross,I'm dead and no one cares?
338,Monica,I look like a man?
339,Chandler,"Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!"
340,Ross,"It isn't ridiculous, look around!"
341,Ross,No one's here!
342,Chandler,"You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!"
343,Ross,"Yes, you're right."
344,Ross,Still somebody must have seen it...
345,Ross,"I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?"
346,Chandler,"Oh, that's not true."
347,Chandler,"You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends."
348,Chandler,Doesn't that count for something?
349,Ross,"Yeah...   Oh, great."
350,Ross,More party boys for Chandler!
351,Chandler,I'm sure it's somebody for you.
352,Chandler,"Now, go hide."
353,Chandler,Kori?
354,Chandler,Kori Weston?
355,Chandler,Wow!
356,Chandler,You look amazing!
357,Chandler,"Chandler, Chandler Bing."
358,Chandler,"I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all."
359,Monica,You are married though.
360,Chandler,"Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood!"
361,Chandler,I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
362,Chandler,I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.
363,Chandler,"And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently."
364,Ross,But you didn't!
365,Ross,I'm still alive!!
366,Ross,"Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you."
367,Ross,It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day!
368,Ross,"I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!"
369,Ross,Did you hear that?
370,Ross,Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
371,Ross,Ending Credits
372,Ross,"No Mum, I'm not dead."
373,Ross,I know it's not something to kid about.
374,Ross,"It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok?"
375,Ross,"Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless."
376,Ross,Monica?
0,Chandler,Hey.
1,Monica,So how was Joan?
2,Chandler,I broke up with her.
3,Chandler,They were huge.
4,Chandler,"When she sneezed, bats flew out of them."
5,Rachel,"Come on, they were not that huge."
6,Chandler,"I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain."
7,Monica,How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
8,Joey,Hold it hold it.
9,Joey,I gotta side with Chandler on this one.
10,Joey,"When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple."
11,Joey,It made me nuts.
12,Chandler,You or me?
13,Ross,I got it.
14,Ross,"Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples."
15,Joey,"You guys are messin' with me, right?"
16,Joey,That was a good one.
17,Joey,"For a second there, I was like, ""whoa."""
18,Phoebe,You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
19,Chandler,Maureen Rosilla.
20,Ross,Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.
21,Monica,"Hello, Mr. Heckles."
22,Monica,MR.
23,Monica,We're not doing anything.
24,Monica,MR.
25,Rachel,You don't have birds.
26,Rachel,MR.
27,Monica,"Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down."
28,Monica,MR.
29,Rachel,"All right, bye-bye."
30,Chandler,"Ok, Janice."
31,Chandler,Janice.
32,Chandler,You gotta give me Janice.
33,Chandler,That wasn't about being picky.
34,Ross,We'll give you Janice.
35,Phoebe,I miss Janice though.
36,Phoebe,"""Hello, Chandler Bing."""
37,Rachel,"""Oh, my, god."""
38,Joey,"""Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it."
39,Joey,"There, faster!"""
40,Monica,"Stop with the broom, we're not making noise."
41,Rachel,We won.
42,Rachel,We won!
43,Monica,Mr. Heckles.
44,Rachel,How did this happen?
45,Rachel,MR.
46,Monica,That's terrible.
47,Monica,MR.
48,Phoebe,"Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building."
49,Phoebe,"Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!"
50,Chandler,"Ok, Phoebe."
51,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help."
52,Phoebe,That's fine.
53,Phoebe,Go ahead and scoff.
54,Phoebe,"You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true."
55,Joey,Such as?
56,Phoebe,"Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?"
57,Ross,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
58,Ross,"What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?"
59,Phoebe,Nah.
60,Phoebe,Not really.
61,Ross,You don't believe in evolution?
62,Phoebe,"I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy."
63,Ross,Too easy?
64,Ross,"Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?"
65,Phoebe,"Yeah, I just don't buy it."
66,Ross,"Uh, excuse me."
67,Ross,"Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe."
68,Ross,"Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity."
69,Phoebe,"Ok, don't get me started on gravity."
70,Ross,"You uh, you don't believe in gravity?"
71,Phoebe,"Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed."
72,Chandler,Uh-Oh.
73,Chandler,"It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed."
74,Chandler,MR.
75,Monica,What can we do for you?
76,Monica,MR.
77,Monica,"Well, what about his family?"
78,Monica,MR.
79,Rachel,"Ok, so let's talk money."
80,Rachel,MR.
81,Monica,I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us.
82,Monica,"I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump?"
83,Monica,He hated us.
84,Monica,This is his final revenge!
85,Rachel,Have you ever seen so much crap?
86,Chandler,"Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap"
87,Joey,Check this out.
88,Joey,Can I have this?
89,Ross,How can you not believe in evolution?
90,Phoebe,Just don't.
91,Phoebe,Look at this funky shirt!
92,Ross,"Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life."
93,Ross,"Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok?"
94,Ross,You can literally see them evolving through time.
95,Phoebe,Really?
96,Phoebe,You can actually see it?
97,Ross,You bet.
98,Ross,"In the U.S., China, Africa, all over."
99,Phoebe,"See, I didn't know that."
100,Ross,"Well, there you go."
101,Phoebe,Huh.
102,Phoebe,"So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?"
103,Chandler,"Hey, look at this."
104,Chandler,"""My Big Book of Grievances."""
105,Joey,"Hey, there's me!"
106,Joey,April 17th.
107,Joey,Excessive noise.
108,Joey,Italian guy comes homes with a date.
109,Joey,"Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too."
110,Chandler,"April 18th, excessive noise."
111,Chandler,Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning.
112,Chandler,Well that's excellent.
113,Rachel,"Monica, Monica, look at this lamp."
114,Rachel,Is this tacky or what?
115,Rachel,We have to have this.
116,Monica,"Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps."
117,Rachel,What?
118,Rachel,"Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool."
119,Monica,It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
120,Rachel,"Well, what about my stuff?"
121,Monica,You don't have any stuff.
122,Rachel,"You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?"
123,Monica,No.
124,Rachel,Yes you do.
125,Rachel,"You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room."
126,Monica,Mmmmm.
127,Rachel,"Ok, while you ""mmm"" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp."
128,Ross,"Ok, Pheebs."
129,Ross,See how I'm making these little toys move?
130,Ross,Opposable thumbs.
131,Ross,"Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?"
132,Phoebe,Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
133,Ross,Please tell me you're joking.
134,Phoebe,"Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't."
135,Ross,"No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--"
136,Phoebe,What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you?
137,Phoebe,"No, what's that all about?"
138,Phoebe,"I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope."
139,Ross,Is there blood coming out of my ears?
140,Joey,"Check it out, check it out."
141,Joey,Heckles' high school yearbook.
142,Chandler,"Wow, he looks so normal."
143,Phoebe,He's even kind of cute.
144,Joey,"""Heckles, you crack me up in science class."
145,Joey,You're the funniest kid in school.
146,Chandler,Funniest?
147,Chandler,Heckles?
148,Joey,That's what it says.
149,Chandler,"Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I."
150,Chandler,He was right.
151,Chandler,Would you listen to that?
152,Phoebe,I'd call that excessive.
153,Chandler,Whoa!
154,Joey,What?
155,Chandler,"Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet."
156,Chandler,"And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool."
157,Joey,"So, you were both dorks."
158,Joey,Big deal.
159,Chandler,"I just think it's weird, you know?"
160,Chandler,"Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?"
161,Joey,Have you been here all night?
162,Chandler,Look at this.
163,Chandler,Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with.
164,Chandler,Look what he wrote on them.
165,Chandler,"Vivian, too tall."
166,Chandler,"Madge, big gums."
167,Chandler,"Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats."
168,Chandler,"This is, this is me."
169,Chandler,This is what I do.
170,Chandler,"I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did."
171,Joey,"Chandler, Heckles was a nut case."
172,Chandler,"Our trains are on the same track, ok?"
173,Chandler,"Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same."
174,Chandler,Bitter Town.
175,Chandler,Aloneville.
176,Chandler,Hermit Junction.
177,Joey,"All right, you know what we gotta do?"
178,Joey,We gotta get you outta here.
179,Joey,"Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go."
180,Chandler,What if I never find someone?
181,Chandler,"Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it ""supposably""?"
182,Joey,"Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody."
183,Chandler,How do you know that?
184,Chandler,How?
185,Joey,"I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out."
186,Chandler,"You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone."
187,Chandler,Will you promise me something?
188,Chandler,"When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?"
189,Joey,"Well, I don't know."
190,Joey,I don't know what we're gonna be doin'.
191,Joey,"I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?"
192,Chandler,"Yeah, I understand."
193,Joey,You can come over and watch the Super Bowl.
194,Joey,"Every year, all right?"
195,Chandler,You know what?
196,Chandler,I'm not gonna end up like this.
197,Chandler,I'll see you man.
198,Joey,Supposably.
199,Joey,Supposably.
200,Joey,Did they go to the zoo?
201,Joey,Supposably.
202,Chandler,"Hi, it's me."
203,Phoebe,Janice?
204,Phoebe,You called Janice?
205,Chandler,"Yes, Janice."
206,Chandler,Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?
207,Ross,"You remember Janice, right?"
208,Chandler,Yes.
209,Chandler,"She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me."
210,Chandler,Janice is my last chance to have somebody.
211,Chandler,"Oh, my, god!"
212,Joey,"Geez, look how fat she got."
213,Chandler,"Janice, you're--"
214,Chandler,Is it--?
215,Chandler,Congratulations.
216,Chandler,You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
217,Monica,"Hey, Rache."
218,Monica,You know what we haven't played in a while?
219,Rachel,What?
220,Monica,Hide the Lamp.
221,Rachel,"Monica, let it go."
222,Monica,Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
223,Rachel,"Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps."
224,Phoebe,Uh-oh.
225,Phoebe,It's Scary Scientist Man.
226,Ross,"Ok, Phoebe, this is it."
227,Ross,In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts.
228,Ross,"A briefcase of facts, if you will."
229,Ross,Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
230,Phoebe,"Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities."
231,Ross,"It's the only possibility, Phoebe."
232,Phoebe,"Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok?"
233,Phoebe,Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat?
234,Phoebe,"And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out."
235,Phoebe,"Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?"
236,Ross,"There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility."
237,Phoebe,I can't believe you caved.
238,Ross,What?
239,Phoebe,You just abandoned your whole belief system.
240,Phoebe,"I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you."
241,Phoebe,"How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow?"
242,Phoebe,"How, how are you going to face the other science guys?"
243,Phoebe,"How, how are you going to face yourself?"
244,Phoebe,Oh!
245,Phoebe,That was fun.
246,Phoebe,So who's hungry?
247,Rachel,I am.
248,Rachel,Let me just get my coat.
249,Monica,"Ok, all right."
250,Monica,"It was an accident, I swear, all right."
251,Monica,"I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke."
252,Rachel,"Oh, please, Monica."
253,Rachel,"You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?"
254,Monica,"Phoebe, tell her!"
255,Phoebe,"Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you."
256,Rachel,Hey Chandler.
257,Rachel,Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
258,Chandler,Neat.
259,Chandler,I'm gonna die alone.
260,Rachel,"Ok, you win."
261,Monica,"Chandler, you're not gonna die alone."
262,Chandler,"Janice was my safety net, ok?"
263,Chandler,And now I have to get a snake.
264,Phoebe,Uh huh.
265,Phoebe,Why is that?
266,Chandler,"If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face."
267,Chandler,"So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, y=know."
268,Chandler,Crazy Snake Man.
269,Chandler,"And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run."
270,Chandler,"""Run away from Crazy Snake Man,"" they'll shout!"
271,Monica,You have got to get over this.
272,Monica,You're not gonna end up alone.
273,Chandler,Of course I am.
274,Chandler,"I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there."
275,Rachel,"Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with."
276,Monica,You are not a freak.
277,Monica,You're a guy.
278,Rachel,She's right.
279,Rachel,She's right.
280,Rachel,You are no different than the rest of them.
281,Monica,"Wait a minute, wait a minute."
282,Monica,Yes he is.
283,Monica,You are totally different.
284,Chandler,In a bad way?
285,Monica,"No, honey, in a wonderful way."
286,Monica,You know what you want now.

114,Rachel,"And then when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face."
115,Rachel,"Yeah, I-I-I-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid."

271,Chandler,"Y'know, it can be more personal."
272,Chandler,You can tell stories about us!
273,Joey,"Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?!"
274,Joey,Remember?

300,Joey,And then the next thing y'know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?
301,Chandler,Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?
302,Joey,Yeah!!
303,Joey,I call that London style.
304,Monica,No that is not what happened with us.

321,Monica,Wouldn't you be?
322,Chandler,"Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink."

332,Chandler,You and I are making out?
333,Monica,"Well, not anymore."
334,Chandler,But we don't do that.
335,Monica,"I know, I just thought it would be fun."
336,Chandler,How drunk are you?
337,Monica,Drunk enough to know that I want to do this.
338,Monica,Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
339,Chandler,That's the perfect amount!
340,Monica,Okay!
341,Monica,Y'know what's weird?
342,Chandler,What?
343,Monica,This doesn't feel weird!
344,Chandler,I know.

348,Monica,Hm-hmm!
349,Chandler,Okay!
350,Monica,Wow!

390,Joey,That's what that was?!
391,Joey,Cause that other thing?
392,Joey,"I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me."
393,Monica,"Okay, can we change the topic?"
394,Monica,Because it's really doing nothing for me.
395,Joey,Oh  Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one?
396,Joey,You two might've never gotten together.
397,Joey,Ooh-ooh!
398,Joey,Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?!
399,Joey,It's like it was in the stars!

417,Chandler,Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
418,Monica,No because it-it didn't seem important.
419,Chandler,"Oh, it's not important?"

421,Chandler,If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him  not me!
422,Monica,Noo!!
423,Monica,The point is that is was you that was there that night!

427,Chandler,I don't believe it.
428,Chandler,The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
429,Monica,"Chandler, please!"
430,Monica,Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?
431,Joey,Hey!
432,Joey,"Now I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!"
433,Chandler,Look there is no way you're doing this wedding now.
434,Chandler,Okay?
435,Joey,What?!
436,Joey,That's not fair!
437,Joey,It's not my fault!
438,Joey,I was off with my bride's maid!
439,Joey,And who's to say I would've even said yes?!
440,Joey,I mean I would've said yes.
441,Joey,"Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right?"
442,Joey,"Look, everything worked out okay!"
443,Chandler,"Okay, it's just weird!"
444,Chandler,Okay?
445,Chandler,I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica!
446,Chandler,I-I-I needI don't know what I need.
447,Chandler,I need a walk.
448,Monica,"Wait Chandler come on, let'sit's not a big deal!"
449,Chandler,It is to me.
450,Chandler,"You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin."
451,Joey,This is crazy.
452,Phoebe,I know!
453,Phoebe,Robin is so gay!
454,Rachel,So now what have we agreed?
455,Rachel,And-and what else?
456,Rachel,Very good.
457,Ross,Rachel!
458,Ross,What are you doing here?
459,Rachel,I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.
460,Ross,Your good friend?
461,Rachel,Yeah!
462,Ross,What's her last name?
463,Rachel,CarolLesbian?
464,Ross,Nice.
465,Ross,"And by the way that uh, that line down my face?"
466,Rachel,What line?
467,Ross,Wh-wh-what line?
468,Ross,"The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh,  ""Dude, don't you ever was your face?"""
469,Rachel,"All right, I'm sorry."
470,Rachel,I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already!
471,Ross,Of course I was mad!
472,Ross,I told you I-I hate this stuff!
473,Ross,Okay?
474,Ross,It-it's not funny!
475,Ross,Hi.
476,Ross,Practical jokes.
477,Ross,You have a line down your face.
478,Rachel,"Okay, maybe they are not funny to you"
479,Rachel,Or Carol!
480,Rachel,But they're funny to kids and who is it hurting?
481,Ross,"Uh, y'know what?"
482,Ross,I'll tell you who it hurts!
483,Ross,It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal's office wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt!
484,Rachel,That was you?!
485,Rachel,We heard about you in Junior High!
486,Rachel,"Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, ""I will be revenged?!"""
487,Ross,I will be!
488,Ross,"Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore."
489,Ross,Okay?
490,Rachel,Fine.
491,Rachel,"Fine, but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel."
492,Rachel,And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!
493,Ross,No that's not what I want.
494,Ross,"Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I"
495,Rachel,"Look he doesn't have any brothers or sisters, somebody's gonna have to teach him this stuff!"
496,Rachel,And I haven't taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn't know anyway!
497,Rachel,I gotta go!
498,Joey,Hey.
499,Chandler,Hey.
500,Chandler,Do you want this scone?
501,Chandler,It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
502,Joey,"Chandler, come on nothing even happened!"
503,Chandler,"Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding"
504,Joey,No-hey-no!
505,Joey,"If you don't want me to do it, I except that."
506,Joey,I don't care about that.
507,Joey,I justI don't want you to be upset.
508,Chandler,How can I not be upset?
509,Chandler,Okay?
510,Chandler,I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
511,Joey,Yeah for like a half an hour one night!
512,Joey,"Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life!"
513,Joey,You're so lucky!
514,Joey,Look what I missed out on by not being there!
515,Joey,Although you know what?
516,Joey,"It could never have worked like you guys did, cause you guys are perfect for each other."
517,Joey,"Y'know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it justit-it fits."
518,Joey,Y'know?
519,Joey,And you just know it's gonna last forever.
520,Chandler,That's what you should say.
521,Joey,What?
522,Chandler,When you're marrying us; that's what you should say.
523,Joey,Really?
524,Joey,I can do it?
525,Chandler,I'd love it if you would do it.
526,Joey,Hey!
527,Chandler,But those are the words!
528,Chandler,Those exact words!
529,Joey,"Well I don't know remember exactly but, it's-it's pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving."
530,Ross,Hey!
531,Rachel,Hey!
532,Ross,"Hey I'm sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit?"
533,Ross,I-I've got this meeting at school.
534,Ross,"And-and he-he asked for his uh, Fun Aunt' Rachel, so"
535,Rachel,Ohhh!
536,Rachel,Well of course I will watch him!
537,Rachel,"We have fun, don't we Ben?"
538,Ross,"Okay, I'll see you later pal."
539,Rachel,"Ohh, okay."
540,Rachel,WhAh-ha!
541,Rachel,Wait a minute.
542,Rachel,"Uh Ben, I can't do it."
543,Ross,What?
544,Rachel,"I can't let him go out that way, he's got a meeting."
545,Rachel,You've got something here on your back.
546,Ross,What?
547,Ross,That's great.
548,Ross,That is great.
549,Ross,What did we just finish talking about Ben?
550,Rachel,Oh I

8,Ross,"It's like uh, in a way you-you complete me  kitchen."
9,Rachel,What?
10,Ross,"You complete me kitchen, matey!"
11,Phoebe,"Ross, I know what you're thinking."
12,Ross,What?
13,Phoebe,"That she's gonna move in with you and maybe then she'll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you're already married, she'll just be happy."
14,Phoebe,Y'know?
15,Phoebe,"You're just, you're very sad."

68,Chandler,What?
69,Phoebe,"Yeah, and I know you guys don't know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get."
70,Monica,Phoebe that's crazy!
71,Joey,I can't believe she would say that too you.
72,Rachel,Yeah honey you don't believe her do you?
73,Phoebe,I don'tshe said y'know that I'd have triplets!
74,Phoebe,But she also said one of them would be black.
75,Chandler,Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you're gonna go?
76,Phoebe,"No, cause she didn't tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there!"

78,Phoebe,I've really gotta start living now!

103,Chandler,You're not talking about Chuckles University?
104,Ross,Okay!
105,Rachel,"Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?"
106,Ross,Thank you!
107,Rachel,"Some uh, some visual aides."
108,Joey,Oh-ooh-ooh!
109,Joey,Y'know what's a good visual aide?
110,Ross,Please don't say naked chicks.
111,Joey,Why not?
112,Ross,I-I-I don't even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it.
113,Ross,Y'know what?
114,Ross,I'm just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
115,Chandler,That's the way I did it til I was 19.

117,Joey,Hey!
118,Joey,Any good mail?

120,Joey,"Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda."
121,Chandler,"""Benefits lapsed."""
122,Joey,Hmm that's weird.
123,Joey,I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
124,Chandler,"Okay, it's not a check."
125,Chandler,"They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year."
126,Joey,Let me see that!
127,Chandler,All right.
128,Joey,"Oh, I can't believe this!"
129,Joey,This sucks!
130,Joey,"When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know?"
131,Joey,And it wouldn't matter.
132,Joey,Now I gotta be careful?
133,Chandler,"I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to  stop catching on fire."
134,Joey,"All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job."
135,Joey,I'm gonna go see my agent.
136,Chandler,"Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street."
137,Joey,look both ways before you cross the street.
138,Phoebe,Hey!

141,Phoebe,"Ugh, it's so exhausting waiting for death."
142,Phoebe,"Ohh, by the way, do you think you could"
143,Rachel,"Pheebs, what-what are you doing?"
144,Phoebe,I was preparing you for mydidn't you think I was dead?
145,Phoebe,Did that not come off?
146,Rachel,"Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me."
147,Rachel,I thought we'd lost you forever.
148,Rachel,"Pheebs, you lie down?"
149,Phoebe,"Yeah, thanks."
150,Phoebe,"And listen, can you do me a favor?"
151,Phoebe,"Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y'know if you can."
152,Rachel,Monica!
153,Monica,Hmm?
154,Rachel,Did-did you take these back?
155,Monica,"No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself."
156,Rachel,"Oh yeah, they're really great!"
157,Rachel,Aren't they?
158,Monica,I loved them!

163,Rachel,Hey!
164,Monica,How'd the lecture go?
165,Ross,It went great!
166,Ross,And I didn't need any jokes or naked chicks either!
167,Rachel,"Wow, that's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before."
168,Ross,I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself.
169,Ross,"Everyone's all, ""Ross you have to be funny and sexy."""
170,Ross,"Well, I proved them wrong!"
171,Ross,"And now, I'm gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler."
172,Monica,That you're not funny or sexy?
173,Ross,That's right!
174,Joey,"Hey Estelle, listen"
175,Joey,What are you talkin' about?
176,Joey,I never left you!
177,Joey,You've always been my agent!
178,Joey,Yeah!
179,Joey,"Estelle, you gotta get me some work."
180,Joey,I-I lost my health insurance.
181,Joey,Why?
182,Joey,Bastard!
183,Chandler,Hey!
184,Joey,Hey!
185,Joey,So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I'll have my health insurance back in no time.
186,Chandler,"That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?"
187,Joey,What?
188,Chandler,What's wrong with you?
189,Joey,Nothing!
190,Joey,"Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since."
191,Joey,"But um, I don't think it's anything serious."
192,Chandler,This sounds like a hernia.
193,Chandler,You have toyou-you go to the doctor!
194,Joey,No way!
195,Joey,"Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!"
196,Chandler,That's a hernia.
197,Joey,Why did I have to start working out again?
198,Joey,Damn you 15s!
199,Rachel,"Well, we're a little early, the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes."
200,Monica,"Yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch."
201,Rachel,"Yeah, we could."
202,Rachel,Oh hey look!
203,Rachel,There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas!
204,Rachel,I was a Kappa.
205,Rachel,Hey sisters!
206,Rachel,"Wow, we really are bitches."
207,Ross,Right!
208,Ross,So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery!
209,Ross,"What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary."
210,Ross,Imagine his consternation when Oh bloody hell.
211,Ross,Commercial Break
212,Monica,What the hell are you doing?
213,Ross,"Look, I was nervous!"
214,Ross,You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring!
215,Ross,I got up there and they were all like staring at me.
216,Ross,I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
217,Rachel,"Yeah, and not a very good one."
218,Ross,Will you-will you please?

229,Rachel,"Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year."
230,Chandler,"Hey, will you grab me a cruller?"
231,Chandler,Sit down!
232,Chandler,Will you go to the hospital?
233,Joey,Dude!
234,Joey,"Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably."
235,Joey,"Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing."
236,Chandler,I will loan you the money.
237,Chandler,Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thingpushed back in.
238,Joey,"Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don't want that hanging over my head."
239,Joey,Okay?
240,Joey,"Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want!"
241,Joey,"Yeah, I'm thinking I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery too."
242,Phoebe,Hey!
243,Chandler,Hey.
244,Joey,Hey!
245,Phoebe,What's going on?
246,Chandler,"Oh Joey's got a really bad hernia, but that's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix!"
247,Joey,"Look, I'm telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here  it doesn't hurt that bad."
248,Phoebe,Hey!
249,Phoebe,Maybe you'll die!
250,Joey,"Sure, now I'm scared."
251,Phoebe,"No, we can go together!"
252,Phoebe,"Just don't wait too long though, okay?"
253,Phoebe,Cause I'm outta here sometime before Friday.
254,Joey,"Yeah, but I don't wanna die!"
255,Phoebe,"No-no, it'll be fun!"
256,Phoebe,We can come back and we can haunt these guys!

261,Rachel,You stole them from me!
262,Monica,Gimme them!
263,Monica,You just wanna each take one?
264,Rachel,Yeah that seems fair.
265,Rachel,We never use them.
266,Ross,"Look, I really need some help, okay?"
267,Ross,Why?
268,Ross,Why did I have to speak in a British accent?!
269,Ross,What do I do?
270,Rachel,Well
271,Monica,Why don't you phase it out?
272,Monica,"Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you're, y'know, that you're adjusting to life in America."
273,Rachel,"Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice."
274,Rachel,I mean they're probably not even listening!
275,Ross,They're not listening too me?
276,Rachel,Of course they're listening to you!
277,Rachel,Everybody listens to you.
278,Ross,Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
279,Monica,I think you look fine.

9,Chandler,Or facing a bitch of a commute.
10,Rachel,"I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away    from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me."
11,Rachel,"And I've already    talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever    we need to make us feel comfortable."
12,Ross,Okay.
13,Rachel,"I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out..."

33,Monica,"Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive..."
34,Joey,"Well, it comes and goes."
35,Joey,I wouldn't trust it.
36,Rachel,"Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me."
37,Rachel,And it means    a lot if you could try to get on board.
38,Phoebe,Of course we can.
39,Phoebe,Congratulations.
40,Phoebe,Yay!
41,Phoebe,Joey...
42,Joey,"No, no, no."

44,Rachel,"Joey, it would mean so..."
45,Joey,Hey!
46,Joey,No!
47,Joey,Get your France-going-arms away from me.
48,Rachel,Joey...
49,Phoebe,You okay with this?
50,Chandler,"Well, it makes me feel sad, but..."
51,Phoebe,Talking to Ross.
52,Chandler,I see.
53,Ross,"Well, Rachel moving to another country?"
54,Ross,Not being able to see her every    day.
55,Ross,How can I be okay with this?
56,Monica,"I know, but what are we gonna do?"
57,Monica,She really needs this job.
58,Ross,"Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back,    she would take it?"
59,Monica,How is that gonna happen?
60,Chandler,Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
61,Ross,I don't know.
62,Ross,I could talk to her boss.
63,Ross,Yeah!
64,Ross,I met him at that Christmas    party.
65,Ross,We really hit it off.
66,Monica,You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?
67,Ross,I didn't say we were brothers.
68,Ross,OPENING CREDITS
69,Monica,Hey Phoebe.
70,Monica,"Hey, tell me what you think."
71,Monica,All right.
72,Monica,The house next    door to the one that we're buying in Westchester?
73,Monica,Just went on the market.
74,Monica,"I wanna    take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't."
75,Chandler,"We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse    us, and we're easily confused."
76,Chandler,We're not very bright.
77,Monica,But what if it is better than ours?
78,Monica,Should we at least look?
79,Chandler,What do you think Pheebs?
80,Phoebe,"Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin    Robbins..."
81,Phoebe,"Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?"
82,Chandler,Yeah.
83,Phoebe,She died.
84,Chandler,You're kidding!
85,Monica,That's terrible!
86,Phoebe,"Yeah, last Saturday."
87,Phoebe,Wow!
88,Phoebe,She was the first black man to fly solo across    the Atlantic.
89,Phoebe,"Oh, wait a minute, I read the    wrong one."
90,Chandler,Oh yeah?
91,Phoebe,"Yeah, she was just an agent."
92,Monica,Joey's gonna be *so* upset.
93,Chandler,I know.
94,Chandler,*He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the    Atlantic.
95,Phoebe,"Well, we cannot tell Joey about this."
96,Phoebe,He's already flipping out about    everything that's changing.
97,Phoebe,This will push him over the edge.
98,Monica,"Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?"
99,Phoebe,"Well, not for a little while."
100,Phoebe,Let's just give him a few days to get    used to everything else.
101,Monica,What if he reads it in the paper?
102,Chandler,"Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay."
103,Ross,"Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's."
104,Ross,"Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas    party about two years ago."
105,Ross,Mr
106,Ross,Close.
107,Ross,Ron.
108,Ross,Mr
109,Ross,"Uhm, well..."
110,Ross,I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.
111,Ross,Mr
112,Ross,"Oh, no."
113,Ross,At first I have to get you to agree.
114,Ross,Then we'll    see if she wants to come back.
115,Ross,Mr
116,Ross,"Look, she loved her job here."
117,Ross,And let's face
118,Ross,"Huh, I took a shot there."
119,Ross,Mr
120,Ross,I see...
121,Ross,Thanks very much.
122,Ross,Is this your son?
123,Ross,Mr
124,Ross,"Oh, nothing, it’s just, it’s close to Ron."
125,Ross,Does he..
126,Ross,Does    little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?
127,Ross,Mr
128,Ross,"How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after    everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants."
129,Ross,I just heard it as you must have heard it and that’s    not good.
130,Ross,Let me start again.
131,Ross,"I’m a paleontologist, you’ll be there    with us and the touching refers only to bones… fossils!"
132,Ross,Mr
133,Ross,"You let Rachel come back, and it’s done."
134,Ross,Mr
135,Ross,Yeah!
136,Ross,Yes!
137,Ross,Thank you!
138,Ross,This is great.
139,Ross,Thank you so much.
140,Ross,"And I swear,    your kid is going to have the time of his life."
141,Ross,Mr
142,Ross,He’ll be fine.
143,Joey,Hey Phoebe.
144,Phoebe,Hey.
145,Phoebe,Everything ok?
146,Joey,I’m just mad at my agent.
147,Phoebe,Estelle?
148,Phoebe,Why?
149,Joey,There’s a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I    didn’t even be put up for it!
150,Joey,She’d better have a good reason.
151,Phoebe,I’m guessing she does.
152,Joey,"Well  I’m wanna hear it,    because she keeps doing this."
153,Phoebe,"Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait."
154,Phoebe,"All right, I gotta go."
155,Phoebe,Just listen.
156,Phoebe,"Promise me, that you    will wait a minute before you call her."
157,Joey,Ok. Why?
158,Phoebe,Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.
159,Joey,I love that saying!
160,Joey,Hello?
161,Joey,Phoebe
162,Joey,I was just gonna call you!
163,Joey,That’s weird.
164,Joey,Phoebe-Estelle
165,Joey,"Yeah, actually I am!"
166,Joey,Phoebe-Estelle
167,Joey,That’s it?
168,Joey,"You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball."
169,Joey,Phoebe-Estelle
170,Joey,"No, no, look."
171,Joey,"All I’m saying is that you’re my agent, ok?"
172,Joey,And you’re not getting me into any auditions and I’m tired of it.
173,Joey,Phoebe-Estelle
174,Joey,I’m saying that… .
175,Joey,"This isn't  working for me    anymore, ok?"
176,Joey,"Estelle, you’re fired."
177,Joey,Goodbye.
178,Phoebe,"Man, tough week for Estelle!"
179,Ross,Hi.
180,Rachel,Hi.
181,Ross,Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house.
182,Ross,You know she can’t sleep    without it.
183,Rachel,"Oh, well, she’s asleep now."
184,Rachel,Stop forcing that thing on her.
185,Ross,Ok.
186,Rachel,"Oh, you’re not gonna believe what happened to me today!"
187,Rachel,"Ralph    Lauren called, and gave me my job back!"
188,Ross,Nooo!
189,Rachel,Yee.
190,Rachel,"I mean, it was so weirdest thing."
191,Rachel,They fired me and then out    of nowhere they just hire me back!
192,Rachel,"I mean, that place must have been falling    apart without me."
193,Ross,"So, you’re not going to Paris."
194,Rachel,"No, I’m still going."
195,Ross,Wh… wh…what?
196,Rachel,"When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back,    the offered me more money!"
197,Rachel,Isn’t that great?
198,Ross,Yeeeah!
199,Monica,Hi.
200,Monica,"We’re buying the house next door, and we were wondering if we  could just take a look around."
201,Monica,Thanks.
202,Chandler,It feels like we’re cheating on our house.
203,Chandler,"And if we’re gonna cheat, shouldn’t it be with like a hot, younger house,    that does stuff that our house won’t do?"
204,Monica,Ours is so much better!
205,Monica,"This living room is smaller, the dining room looks    like a cave!"
206,Monica,What a hole!
207,Monica,Love it!
208,Monica,"They could be our neighbors, what are they like?"
209,Phoebe,"Hey Joey, want come with me to… are you ok?"
210,Joey,"Yeah, I just… I just feel bad about firing Estelle."
211,Joey,This is got to be    killing her.
212,Phoebe,"No, that wouldn’t kill her."
213,Phoebe,Ordinary embolism might.
214,Joey,I don’t know.
215,Joey,"She’s got to be taking it hard, I was like    her only client."
216,Joey,Except for this guy who eats paper.
217,Joey,And I’m guessing    he eats more money than he makes.
218,Joey,"Look, I know she’s not a great agent, but    she did stick with me for ten years."
219,Joey,I’m gonna call her and hire her again.
220,Phoebe,"No, no, no!"
221,Phoebe,Don't call her!
222,Phoebe,You wait for her to call    you
223,Joey,Why?
224,Phoebe,Because patience is the road to understanding  which ...    is the key... to a happy heart.
225,Joey,You blow me away.
226,Phoebe,"All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her    to call you?"
227,Joey,I promise.
228,Joey,"And that means, never having to give a reason."
229,Chandler,And yet I never run into Beyonce!
230,Chandler,"Don't, don't!"
231,Monica,"No, actually, we're buying the house next door."
232,Chandler,Why!
233,Monica,I don't know    why.
234,Chandler,This can not be happening!
235,Monica,"Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer."
236,Monica,Maybe the Janice's won't get it!
237,Monica,Maybe the other couple will.
238,Chandler,"The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple    are the Hitlers."
239,Monica,"Okay, Okay,     All right."
240,Monica,What if we got both houses?
241,Monica,Huh?
242,Monica,We can turn this house    into a guest house.
243,Chandler,That is a great idea!
244,Chandler,"And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful,    but when did you start crapping money!"
245,Monica,"Okay, you come up with an idea."
246,Chandler,"Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on    our house."
247,Chandler,We can still get out.
248,Monica,But we love our house.
249,Chandler,Will we love it so much with her next door?
250,Chandler,And she's gonna be louder    out here too.
251,Chandler,"Just the crickets and  ""Oh My God""!"
252,Monica,"Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever    we go!"
253,Monica,"I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise."
254,Monica,"I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls    jump back up inside your body."
255,Chandler,"Well, we    have to do something."
256,Chandler,We can't have her living next door.
257,Chandler,"Oh, that does it too."
258,Ross,It's me.
259,Ross,Ron.
260,Ross,"Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might    be able to get her to come back."
261,Ross,Mr
262,Ross,Just hear me out.
263,Ross,How would you feel about offering her a raise?
264,Ross,Mr
265,Ross,Perhaps I can persuade you.
266,Ross,What if you can give your son this  genuine pterodactyl egg  replica.
267,Ross,Mr
268,Ross,Huh?
269,Ross,So?
270,Ross,We have a deal?
271,Ross,Mr
272,Ross,Yes!
273,Ross,yes!
274,Ross,Mr
275,Ross,"Oh,  Believe me, the ladies, they love it!"
276,Ross,Mr
277,Ross,"Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much."
278,Joey,Oh my God.
279,Joey,Hello?
280,Phoebe,"Joey,    it's Estelle."
281,Joey,Estelle?
282,Phoebe,"Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for    firing me."
283,Joey,Ok-ay.
284,Joey,"I just, I can't believe you're calling me?"
285,Phoebe,"Well, I didn't think I should just drop by..."
286,Joey,"No, no, no!"
287,Joey,"Don't drop by,    don't drop by!"
288,Phoebe,"Anyway, you did what you had to do."
289,Phoebe,I'm okay.
290,Joey,Can I ask you something?
291,Joey,"Uhm, what's it like there?"
292,Phoebe,It's alright.
293,Phoebe,"Look kiddo, I gotta go."
294,Phoebe,Good luck with    the career.
295,Phoebe,You're gonna be huge.
296,Joey,Thanks for everything Estelle.
297,Joey,Bye.
298,Joey,"""out of area""."
299,Joey,"Boy, I'll say."
300,Chandler,The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
301,Chandler,Wait!
302,Chandler,I just want you to know that...
303,Chandler,I'm so happy you're going to    be here.
304,Chandler,Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
305,Chandler,I never stopped loving you.
306,Chandler,"Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
307,Chandler,I want you...
308,Chandler,I need you...
309,Chandler,I must have you Janice    Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.
310,Chandler,"Now that you live next door, we can be together every day."
311,Chandler,Sid and    Monica never have to know a thing.
312,Chandler,Obviously.
313,Chandler,Don't say that.
314,Chandler,Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
315,Chandler,I understand.
316,Chandler,They're never coming down now.
317,Rachel,Hi!
318,Ross,Hey!
319,Rachel,You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
320,Ross,What?
321,Rachel,Ralph Lauren called again and they offered    me more money.
322,Ross,They did?
323,Rachel,Yeah.
324,Rachel,It was the weirdest thing.
325,Rachel,Zelner called me and he said we'll    do everything we can to get you back.
326,Rachel,And that I should thank some Ron...
327,Rachel,I    don't even know what department that guy's in.
328,Ross,"So, what are you gonna do?"
329,Rachel,"Well, I took it."
330,Ross,That's great!
331,Ross,So you're staying in New York!
332,Ross,"You're excited, right?"
333,Rachel,Ye-ah.
334,Rachel,Yeah!
335,Rachel,"You know, the money's great."
336,Rachel,It's certainly the easier choice...
337,Ross,Right!
338,Rachel,"Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to    Paris?"
339,Rachel,Sure.
340,Rachel,"You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital    of the world?"
341,Rachel,"Ooh, absolutely... Oh...!"
342,Rachel,"Yeah, but you know, this is... it's    fine."
343,Rachel,I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of    that I possibly can...
344,Ross,"Uhm, I hadn't no you..."
345,Ross,I had no idea you were so excited about Paris.
346,Ross,"Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared."
347,Rachel,"Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know?"
348,Rachel,Like when    I-moved-to-New-York scared.
349,Rachel,"Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared..."
350,Rachel,But this is... fine.
351,Rachel,This is gonna be good.
352,Ross,You should go.
353,Rachel,What?
354,Ross,It's what you want.
355,Ross,You should go.
356,Rachel,You really think so?
357,Ross,I really do.
358,Rachel,But I already told Zelner that I would come back...
359,Ross,I'm sure he'll    understand.
360,Rachel,All right.
361,Rachel,ALL RIGHT!
362,Rachel,I'm gonna do it.
363,Rachel,I'm gonna go to Paris.
364,Ross,Yeah...
365,Rachel,Yeah!
366,Rachel,I'm going to Paris.
367,Rachel,"Thank you, Ross!"
368,Ross,"Yeah, yeah, oh!"
369,Rachel,Oh!

372,Ross,COMMERCIAL BREAK
373,Joey,Thank you all for coming.
374,Joey,We're here today to pay respects    to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman...     ..inside.
375,Joey,As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words.

12,Ross,"Ah, somebody's at the door on the ceiling."
13,Rachel,"Noo, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor."
14,Monica,"He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything."
15,Phoebe,"Why don't you go up there and ask him to step lightly, please?'"
16,Monica,"I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him."
17,Phoebe,"Ooh, that is silly."
18,Phoebe,"I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down."
19,Monica,"All right, be my guest."
20,Rachel,Good luck.
21,Joey,"All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya."
22,Joey,"When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye."
23,Joey,I just did it.
24,Joey,"I just did it, again."
25,Joey,"Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it."
26,Phoebe,"Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... ."
27,Phoebe,"Oh, thank you."
28,Phoebe,Opening Credits
29,Chandler,"Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?"
30,Monica,"Honey, what's the matter?"
31,Chandler,I just saw Janice.
32,Chandler,"Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy."
33,Chandler,I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
34,Joey,"Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up."
35,Joey,"She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking."
36,Joey,"God, it killed me."
37,Chandler,"Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon."
38,Joey,"Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know...."
39,Ross,"Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then."
40,Chandler,"Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me."
41,Monica,It's Joey's birthday.
42,Chandler,"Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him."
43,Monica,Sush!!
44,Monica,I cannot believe she is still up there.
45,Chandler,"Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line."
46,Chandler,"Y'know, it's supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh."

58,Rachel,Mr.
59,Rachel,"Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it."
60,Monica,"I know honey, I'm sorry."
61,Rachel,"Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in."
62,Monica,"Gee, I don't know Rach."
63,Monica,Order up!!
64,Monica,"I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!"
65,Rachel,"Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't...."
66,Rachel,"I don't mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom."
67,Rachel,Hi!
68,Rachel,Is my misery amusing to you?
69,Rachel,"It's not funny, this is actually my job."
70,Rachel,"Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here."
71,Rachel,And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
72,Rachel,Yes?
73,Rachel,Do you want my pickle?
74,Monica,Hey Gunther.
75,Monica,Hi.
76,Monica,I mean you're going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
77,Phoebe,"Well, he's very charming."
78,Monica,"I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him."
79,Phoebe,"Well, you're just gonna have to try."
80,Monica,"Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?"
81,Joey,"I don't know, Chandler is supposed to be passin' em around..."
82,Joey,Chandler!
83,Chandler,Hello-dillillio!
84,Ross,"Oh, somebody's feeling better."
85,Monica,Stick out your tongue.
86,Chandler,Take off your shirt!
87,Monica,Oh my!
88,Joey,Oh my God!
89,Joey,How many of these things did you have?
90,Joey,These are pure vodka.
91,Chandler,"Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make."
92,Rachel,The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
93,Ross,Hi!
94,Rachel,Hi!
95,Rachel,"So I'm out having lunch at Monica's and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale's and there happens to be an opening in his department."
96,Rachel,So I gave him my phone number and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!
97,Ross,Wow!
98,Rachel,I know!
99,Ross,"What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?"
100,Rachel,Uh-huh!
101,Ross,"And he's, he's a total stranger?"
102,Rachel,Yeah!
103,Rachel,"His name is um, Mark something."
104,Ross,Huh.
105,Ross,Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.
106,Rachel,What!
107,Ross,"Well, I'm just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason."
108,Rachel,To be nice.
109,Ross,"Hey, Joey."
110,Ross,Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
111,Joey,"No, only for sex."
112,Ross,Thank you.
113,Ross,"So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?"
114,Rachel,"I didn't have to, because I was wearing my I heart Ross' sandwich board and ringing my bell."
115,Ross,Uh-huh.
116,Ross,Joey's
117,Joey,Hey!!
118,Joey,Hey-hey-hey!
119,Chandler,"Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?"
120,Monica,How hammered are you?
121,Monica,Huh?
122,Monica,"These, these are Joey's sisters."
123,Chandler,Hi Joey's sisters!
124,Phoebe,Hey!

127,Phoebe,"Okay, I don't know how to talk to you."
128,Phoebe,Sister
129,Chandler,"Oh, I'm taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer."
130,Chandler,Joey's
131,Chandler,"No-no-no-no, no, it's a good thing."
132,Chandler,Why must we dial so speedily anyway?
133,Chandler,Why must we rush through life?
134,Chandler,Why can't we savor the precious moments?
135,Chandler,Those are some huge breasts you have.
136,Ross,Hi.
137,Monica,Hi.
138,Ross,Yeah.
139,Ross,"So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today."
140,Monica,Isn't that great?
141,Ross,Oh yeah!
142,Ross,"So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good."
143,Ross,"He sounds like a nice, good guy."
144,Monica,"Oh, he is."
145,Monica,And he is so dreamy.
146,Monica,"I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, Hummina-hummina-hummina.'"
147,Ross,That's excellent.
148,Ross,"So, he's just a nice guy."
149,Ross,You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him?
150,Rachel,"Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job."
151,Monica,How ya feelin'?
152,Chandler,"Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it."
153,Phoebe,Where'd you get too?
154,Phoebe,We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
155,Ross,Yeah.
156,Chandler,"Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone."
157,Chandler,"Ow, no woo-hooing,' no woo-hooing.'"
158,Phoebe,"Why, what happened?"
159,Chandler,"Ah, I fooled around with Joey's sister."
160,Chandler,"Well, that's not the worst part."
161,Monica,What is the worse part?
162,Chandler,I can't remember which sister.
163,Ross,You see what men do!
164,Ross,Don't tell me men are not nice!
165,Ross,This is men!!
166,Ross,Commercial Break
167,Monica,Are you insane?
168,Monica,"I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead."
169,Chandler,Okay!
170,Chandler,You don't think I thought of that?
171,Phoebe,How can you not know which one?
172,Rachel,I mean that's unbelievable.
173,Monica,"I mean, was it Gina?"
174,Ross,Which one is Gina?
175,Rachel,"Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings."
176,Monica,"No, no, no, that's Dina."
177,Chandler,"You see you can't tell which one is which either, dwha!"
178,Phoebe,We didn't fool around with any of them.
179,Phoebe,Dwha!
180,Phoebe,Dwha!
181,Chandler,Veronica.
182,Chandler,"Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt."
183,Chandler,I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
184,Monica,That was me.
185,Chandler,"Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry."
186,Monica,That's okay.
187,Rachel,That's all right.
188,Ross,That's okay.
189,Joey,Can I talk to you for a second?
190,Ross,"Hey, Joey."
191,Rachel,Hey.
192,Joey,Come on!
193,Chandler,Why can't we talk in here?
194,Chandler,"With, with, witnesses."
195,Joey,I just got off the phone with my sister.
196,Ross,"Ah, which, which one?"
197,Joey,Mary-Angela.
198,Ross,Mary-Angela.
199,Joey,Yeah.
200,Monica,Y'know which one was she again?
201,Joey,"Why don't you ask Chandler, cause he's the one that fooled around with her."
202,Joey,She told me you said you could really fall for her.
203,Joey,Now is that true?
204,Joey,Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister.
205,Chandler,It's gotta be the first one.
206,Joey,Really?
207,Joey,That's great!
208,Joey,"You and my sister, sittin' in a tree."
209,Chandler,"Yep, I'm in a tree."
210,Rachel,Did he call?
211,Rachel,Did Mark call?
212,Monica,"No honey, I'm sorry, but the weekend's not over yet."
213,Rachel,Oh.
214,Rachel,"Oh my God, is that Phoebe?"
215,Monica,I guess they're back from their date.
216,Rachel,Music.
217,Rachel,Very nice.
218,Monica,Oh my God!
219,Rachel,"So, how are you?"
220,Monica,I am good.
221,Monica,I finished my book.
222,Rachel,"Oh yeah, what's it about?"
223,Monica,I don't remember.
224,Monica,Do you wanna take a walk?
225,Rachel,"Yeah, I do."
226,Ross,Dear Mary-Angela.
227,Ross,Hi.
228,Ross,How's it going.
229,Ross,This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write.
230,Ross,What the hell's a matter with you?
231,Ross,How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
232,Chandler,"Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France."
233,Chandler,When actually I'll be in Cuba.
234,Ross,"All right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay in person."
235,Ross,At least you know her name.
236,Ross,"You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy."
237,Chandler,What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
238,Ross,Where in Cuba?
239,Chandler,"Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?"
240,Joey,Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry.
241,Joey,What about you?
242,Chandler,I'm here to see Mary-Angela.
243,Joey,You are so the man!
244,Joey,"Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off."
245,Joey,She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body.
246,Joey,Yeah.
247,Chandler,Where's Mary-Angela?
248,Joey,She's right in there.
249,Joey,Joey's
250,Rachel,I can't believe Mark didn't call.
251,Rachel,"It's Sunday night, and he didn't call."
252,Ross,Bummer.
253,Rachel,"Yeah, right."
254,Rachel,"Look at you, you're practically giddy."
255,Ross,"No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out."
256,Ross,"Look, Rach, I want only good things for you."
257,Monica,"Wait a minute, why don't you just call Mark."
258,Monica,"I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen."
259,Ross,"But, you, you don't want to seem too pushy."
260,Monica,"Honey, it's not pushy, he gave her his home number."
261,Ross,"What, he gave you his home number?"
262,Ross,"As in like, to, to his home?"
263,Rachel,"Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me."
264,Ross,"That's right good things, that-that is what I said."
265,Rachel,"Hello, Mark?"
266,Rachel,"Hi, it's Rachel Green."
267,Rachel,"Oh no, don't you apologize."
268,Rachel,"Yeah, I'll hold."
269,Rachel,"He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers."
270,Ross,That is so made up!
271,Rachel,"Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow!"
272,Rachel,"That, no, it's perfect."
273,Rachel,"Oh God, thank you soo much."
274,Rachel,Great!

280,Monica,"Oh, that is amazing!"
281,Ross,"Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I'd expect nothing less."
282,Rachel,I got to figure out what I'm going to wear.
283,Ross,High collar and baggy pants say I'm a pro.
284,Rachel,Yeah!
285,Rachel,Right!
286,Rachel,"Okay, I'll see you guys later."
287,Rachel,Woo hoo!

290,Ross,Did I hurt you in some way?
291,Monica,What?
292,Ross,Why don't you call him?!'
293,Ross,"Well, thank you very much!"
294,Ross,"Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!"
295,Monica,Are you crazy?
296,Ross,Am I!
297,Ross,Am I!
298,Ross,Am I out of my mind!
299,Ross,Am I losing my senses!!
300,Ross,This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
301,Monica,What?!
302,Monica,Ross y'know this isn't even about you!
303,Monica,I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her.
304,Monica,"I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?"
305,Ross,No.
306,Monica,I mean don't you trust her?
307,Ross,"Well, yeah!"
308,Monica,Then get over yourself!
309,Monica,Grow up!
310,Ross,You grow up.
311,Chandler,"This teramisu is, is excellent."

346,Chandler,Mary-Theresa
347,Joey,What?!
348,Joey,"How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?"
349,Chandler,I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was.
350,Chandler,"Look, I'm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar."
351,Chandler,Joey's
352,Chandler,"Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me."
353,Chandler,Are ya?
354,Joey,"Well, that is usually what I would do."
355,Joey,But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it.
356,Joey,How could you do this?
357,Chandler,"Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it."
358,Chandler,"But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend."
359,Chandler,I would never do anything like this ever again.

47,Ross,"I mean,   it looks really good."
48,Ross,I wonder if I should get one!
49,Chandler,"Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can   really show it off."
50,Ross,"So, do you get colours or just French tips?"
51,Monica,There.
52,Monica,Here's their card.
53,Ross,Thanks.
54,Ross,"Hey, I know where this   place is!"
55,Ross,It used to be an X-rated video...  florist.
56,Phoebe,Hey!
57,Chandler,Hey Pheebs!
58,Monica,Hey Phoebe!
59,Phoebe,"Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town."
60,Monica,"I know, Amanda!"
61,Monica,Ah!
62,Monica,She called me   too!
63,Monica,She's the worst!
64,Chandler,Who's Amanda?
65,Monica,She's this girl who used to live   in the building before you did.
66,Monica,Then she moved to England and she picked up   this fake British accent.
67,Monica,On the machine this is her message.
68,Monica,"""Monica, darling!"
69,Monica,"It's Amanda calling!"""
70,Chandler,Are you trying to do a British accent?
71,Monica,Chandler gets   pedicures!
72,Chandler,"Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?"
73,Phoebe,You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on   the phone?
74,Phoebe,"""Oh, so sorry to catch you   on your Mo-Bile!"""
75,Phoebe,"If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call   me on my mo-Bile!"""
76,Monica,"I know, and she's always bragging   about all the famous people she's met."
77,Phoebe,"Oh, I know!"
78,Phoebe,"""Oh...I slept with Billy Joel""."
79,Phoebe,"All right, who hasn't?"
80,Monica,"Oh, what are we gonna do!"
81,Monica,I don't   wanna see her!
82,Phoebe,"Ugh, Let's just cut her out!"
83,Monica,What?
84,Phoebe,Cut her out of our lives!
85,Phoebe,Just ignore her calls and   dodge her 'till she gets the point!
86,Monica,"Oh, I guess we could try that, but...   it seems so harsh!"
87,Monica,Have you ever done that?
88,Chandler,"No, had it done to me though."
89,Chandler,Feels good !
90,Ross,Well...
91,Ross,"I like how you look, what are you?"
92,Ross,"Two, I think a two."
93,Ross,"Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat."
94,Ross,"Well, I have a PhD, so..."
95,Ross,"One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis..."
96,Ross,WAIT!
97,Ross,WAIT!
98,Ross,I'm not-I've   not finished counting!
99,Ross,You sprayed my front twice!
100,Ross,"No, I barely even   got to three Mississippi."
101,Ross,Mississippilesly?
102,Ross,"Well, how   bad is it?"
103,Ross,"So, how dark is it   gonna get?"
104,Ross,I'm a four?
105,Ross,Really!
106,Ross,Ok!
107,Ross,"Wait, wait a minute, there's no light   on the back wall!"
108,Ross,How do I know when it's gonna start?
109,Ross,Hello?
110,Ross,"Ah, oh, ah!"
111,Ross,Ah!
112,Ross,The same thing   happened again!
113,Ross,I'm an eight!

115,Joey,I thought you paid.
116,Joey,"Ha, guess we won’t be going back there!"
117,Rachel,So.
118,Joey,Yeah.
119,Joey,"Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of   the couch?"
120,Rachel,"I say ‘cheesy line’, but ok."
121,Joey,What’s the matter?
122,Rachel,"I am sorry, I don’t know, I am sorry, I don’t   know why I did that!"
123,Rachel,Joey and

129,Joey,"I don’t get it, Chandler loved it!"
130,Rachel,"Ok, ok, ok."
131,Rachel,"I promise, I promise, I promise, I won’t   do it again."
132,Rachel,I really do.
133,Rachel,I promise.
134,Rachel,This is gonna be great.
135,Joey,Ok.
136,Joey,"Uh, was that good for you?"
137,Monica,"No, no, don’t get it."
138,Monica,Let the machine pick up.
139,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah."
140,Phoebe,Could be Rachel asking if someone could   baby-sit again.
141,Monica,It could be Amanda!
142,Phoebe,"Oh, you’re right!"
143,Phoebe,I was just kidding about   Rachel.
144,Phoebe,Babysitting is a gas!
145,Monica,You're from Yonkers!
146,Monica,Your last name   is Buffo-Martisis!
147,Phoebe,"Ok, don’t hold thy breath!"
148,Chandler,Hello?

158,Phoebe,"Why, why, why didn’t you just say no!"
159,Monica,"Well, I said 'no' to her coming   over now!"
160,Monica,I couldn’t say 'no' twice!
161,Monica,I get this uncontrollable need to   please people!
162,Phoebe,"Fine, fine!"
163,Phoebe,You would not hold up well   under torture!
164,Monica,And you would?
165,Phoebe,I did!
166,Phoebe,[scene
167,Joey,"Rach, you sure you wanna do this?"
168,Rachel,Absolutely!
169,Rachel,Absolutely.

183,Rachel,Well this is romantic!
184,Joey,I'm sorry!
185,Joey,This never happened to me   before!
186,Joey,I'm an expert at taking off bras!
187,Joey,I can do it with one hand!
188,Joey,I can   do it with my eyes closed!
189,Joey,"One time I just looked at one, and it popped open!"
190,Joey,I blame your bra!
191,Rachel,It’s a standard issue bra clasp!
192,Joey,Then I blame you!
193,Joey,Yeah!
194,Joey,That's right!
195,Joey,You threw me   off with all your slapping!
196,Rachel,"Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey,   but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take   off my bra?"
197,Joey,NAH!
198,Joey,I don't have another level!
199,Chandler,Hold on!
200,Chandler,There is something different.
201,Ross,I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
202,Chandler,Was that place...
203,Chandler,The Sun?
204,Ross,Oh!
205,Ross,And it gets worse!
206,Chandler,Oh My God!
207,Chandler,You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory   all by yourself!
208,Monica,How could you mess this up?
209,Monica,It's   so easy?
210,Monica,"You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!"
211,Ross,How do you count to five?
212,Monica,One Two Three...
213,Ross,Damnit!
214,Rachel,oooh!
215,Rachel,Oh oh!
216,Ross,I Know!
217,Rachel,oh oh!
218,Rachel,What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
219,Chandler,How was your date with Joey?
220,Rachel,"Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment,   and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and   I kept slapping it away!"
221,Chandler,You didn't like that?
222,Rachel,"Well, it wasn't just me, alright?"
223,Rachel,He freaked out   too!
224,Rachel,He couldn't even undo my bra!
225,Monica,"Wow, really?"
226,Monica,One time he just looked   at my bra and it popped open.
227,Rachel,"I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have   kissed before and that's been great!"
228,Rachel,But this time it was leading somewhere   and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
229,Monica,"Well, you guys have been friends   forever."
230,Monica,Remember the first time that you kissed Ross?
231,Monica,How weird that was?
232,Monica,You couldn't stop laughing?
233,Monica,You got through that.
234,Rachel,"Ok, that's true."
235,Rachel,"That's true,   we can do this."
236,Rachel,"You're right, you're right, we can do this."
237,Rachel,We're just gonna   power through!
238,Joey,Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second .
239,Rachel,No need!!
240,Rachel,"Problem solved, we are powering through   ."
241,Monica,"Chandler,   stop!"
242,Monica,It is not going to pop open!
243,Chandler,You don't   know!
244,Monica,Hey Phoebe!
245,Phoebe,Hey!
246,Monica,Is Amanda here yet?
247,Phoebe,No.
248,Monica,Oh good.
249,Monica,"Good, look   I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan."
250,Monica,But I have a new plan.
251,Monica,Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.
252,Phoebe,Oh!
253,Phoebe,"Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both   out of here?"
254,Monica,"Well, what do you think of Mike   and Chandler being in a car accident?"
255,Phoebe,"Are you kidding, I love it!"
256,Phoebe,Hi!
257,Monica,Hi!
258,Monica,Yeah!

264,Monica,You were going to cut   me out?
265,Phoebe,Well...kinda.
266,Monica,Oh My God!
267,Phoebe,"Yeah well, in America you're just an ""ass""."
268,Monica,Hello?
269,Monica,"Chandler,   what's wrong?"
270,Monica,"Oh my God, are you alright?"
271,Monica,"Yeah, I'll be right there."
272,Monica,"I'm so sorry,   but Chandler was in a car accident."
273,Phoebe,Oh my   God.

284,Rachel,Alright!
285,Rachel,Lets do it!
286,Joey,"Ok, you're scaring me a little bit."
287,Rachel,Oh!
288,Rachel,"Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this!"
289,Rachel,Ok. Aha!
290,Rachel,You like   that huh?
291,Joey,Oh!

298,Joey,You kneed me in my misters!
299,Rachel,What?
300,Rachel,Oh my God!
301,Rachel,I'm so sorry.
302,Rachel,Joey?
303,Rachel,Are you ok?
304,Joey,Soldier down!
305,Monica,We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.
306,Chandler,"If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!"
307,Phoebe,Oh Chandler!
308,Phoebe,Thank God you're alive.
309,Phoebe,"Monica, can   I talk to you outside for a minute?"
310,Monica,I have nothing to say to   you.
311,Phoebe,"Please, Monica?"
312,Phoebe,In the hall?
313,Chandler,"Well, aren't you a treat."
314,Monica,I can't believe you tried to cut   me out.
315,Monica,"Why Phoebe, why?"
316,Phoebe,"It was right after we were living together and you   were driving me crazy, okay?"
317,Phoebe,You were really controlling and compulsive and   shrill.
318,Monica,I'm still all those things!
319,Phoebe,You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!
320,Monica,I am scrappy.
321,Phoebe,Exactly!
322,Phoebe,"Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't   keep you out of my life."
323,Phoebe,"Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only   one who ever clawed her way back in."
324,Monica,It's because I'm scrappy.
325,Phoebe,"Yeah, you are."
326,Phoebe,"And I'm so glad that you fought your   way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you."
327,Monica,I won't know what I would do without   you.
328,Monica,"Well, I guess we should go back   in."
329,Monica,"When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda."
330,Phoebe,"Yeah, I guess you're right."
331,Ross,"I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda."
332,Ross,Okay?
333,Ross,"Does   it look like this is my first time, huh?"
334,Ross,Now I want 4 two's... and I want them   all on my back.
335,Ross,"Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one   is it?"
336,Ross,Which... which... which...
337,Ross,Which one is it?
338,Ross,OH!
339,Ross,SON OF A BITCH!
340,Rachel,What is the matter with us?
341,Joey,"Well, I know what's the matter with me."
342,Rachel,"No, I mean with us, you know."
343,Rachel,"I mean, is it supposed   to be this... difficult?"
344,Joey,I don't know.
345,Chandler,"That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she   sure can dance... Hey!"
346,Rachel,Hi!
347,Rachel,"Hey, listen, can we ask you a question?"
348,Rachel,"When   you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more   than that?"
349,Chandler,"Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide   from you guys..."
350,Rachel,"No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally..."
351,Joey,"Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it   was... really wrong?"
352,Chandler,"Actually, no."
353,Chandler,"No, it felt right."
354,Chandler,"You know, it felt   like uhm..."
355,Chandler,I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.
356,Chandler,"I can tell from your expressions that that's the   good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the   joy."
357,Rachel,"Well, just because it happened that way for them   doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us."
358,Joey,"Yeah, yeah..."
359,Joey,Absolutely.
360,Joey,"I mean, just because something's   difficult doesn't mean that you quit."
361,Rachel,"Right, totally."
362,Joey,"Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we...   do it."
363,Rachel,"Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one   of those couples that never have sex."
364,Joey,That's a... pla-an.
365,Joey,Wow...
366,Joey,I did not see this coming.
367,Rachel,I know.
368,Joey,I don't get it.
369,Joey,"I mean, I was so sure this was what   I wanted."
370,Rachel,Hmmm... Me too...
371,Rachel,I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
372,Joey,I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
373,Rachel,Aah...
374,Rachel,I bet you're right.
375,Joey,So...
376,Rachel,Yeah.
377,Joey,I love ya.

25,Ross,"Look, Chandler, it's my joke."

79,Monica,"Well, she's not going to find them lying in the grass like that."
80,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah."
81,Phoebe,"Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?"
82,Phoebe,Rachel and
83,Monica,Yeah.

100,Joey,"I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it."
101,Ross,"What, you didn't get it?"
102,Ross,The doctor is a monkey.

107,Chandler,"So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money."
108,Ross,"Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I'll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer."

116,Joey,"Ya see, it's just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y'know?"
117,Joey,"And to go from that to this, I just Plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends."
118,Joey,What?
119,Joey,Maybe I could be a waiter.
120,Joey,Could I use the phone?
121,Monica,She picked Rachel.
122,Monica,"I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious."
123,Monica,She picked Rachel.
124,Chandler,"He took my joke, he took it."
125,Monica,It's wrong.
126,Monica,You know what else is wrong?
127,Monica,Phoebe picking Rachel.
128,Chandler,You know who else picked Rachel?
129,Chandler,"Ross, and you know what else Ross did?"
130,Chandler,He stole my joke.
131,Chandler,You know what?
132,Chandler,I'm going to get a joke journal.
133,Chandler,Y'know?
134,Chandler,And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
135,Monica,That's a good idea.
136,Chandler,Yeah!
137,Monica,Do you know what's a bad idea?
138,Chandler,Picking Rachel.
139,Monica,That's right.
140,Monica,Did you hear something?
141,Chandler,Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
142,Monica,It's coming from the living room.
143,Joey,I finished my book.
144,Monica,"Hey, you guys."
145,Monica,Phoebe and
146,Rachel,Hey.
147,Monica,"Oh, don't you guys look cute."
148,Monica,You guys make such a cute couple.
149,Rachel,"Monica, what are you doing?"
150,Monica,"Nothing, I'm just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day."
151,Monica,"Remember, when you picked Rachel over me?"
152,Monica,That was funny.
153,Phoebe,I guess it was kinda funny.
154,Monica,It wasn't funny at all!
155,Monica,Why would you do that?
156,Monica,Why didn't you pick me?
157,Phoebe,Fine.
158,Phoebe,The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you're  just  kinda high maintenanceOkay let's go to lunch!
159,Monica,That is completely untrue.
160,Monica,You think I'm high maintenance?
161,Monica,"Okay, prove it."
162,Monica,I want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!
163,Phoebe,"No, okay, you're right."
164,Phoebe,You're easy-going.
165,Phoebe,You're just not as easy-going as Rachel.
166,Phoebe,She's just more flexible and-and mellow.
167,Phoebe,That's all.
168,Rachel,"Well, people are different."
169,Phoebe,"Ya, you know, Rachel  she'll do whatever you want."
170,Phoebe,"Y'know, you can just walk all over her."
171,Rachel,What?
172,Rachel,Wait a minute.
173,Rachel,"What are you saying, that I'm a pushover?"
174,Rachel,I'm not a pushover.
175,Phoebe,"Oh, okay,  you're not a pushover."
176,Rachel,Oh my  you think I'm a pushover.
177,Rachel,"Well wait, watch this, you know what?"
178,Rachel,You're not invited to lunch.
179,Rachel,What do you think of that?
180,Rachel,"I think that's pretty strong, that's what I think."
181,Rachel,"Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch."
182,Monica,You start working on that list.
183,Rachel,I cannot believe her.
184,Monica,I know.
185,Monica,Where do you wanna go eat?
186,Rachel,"Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place."
187,Monica,I'm sick of Japanese.
188,Monica,We're not going there.
189,Rachel,"All right, wherever you wanna go is cool."
190,Monica,All right.
191,Ross,"Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out."
192,Joey,"Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, cause I'm heading up there."
193,Ross,"Uh, yeah, I'll take a coffee."
194,Ross,"Thanks, man."
195,Joey,Sure.
196,Joey,Coffee?
197,Joey,Cause I'm going up there.
198,Rachel,No.
199,Monica,"No, thank you."
200,Joey,"You guys need anything, cause I'm heading up there."
201,Joey,You got it.
202,Monica,"Joey, what are you doing?"
203,Joey,Just being friendly.
204,Rachel,"Joey, honey, I don't think you're supposed to go back there."
205,Joey,"Nah, it's okay."
206,Joey,"Right, Gunther?"
207,Joey,"Okay, but I don't see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons."
208,Monica,"Joey, do you work here?"
209,Joey,No.
210,Joey,Yeah?
211,Joey,Commercial Break
212,Monica,"Joey, what's going on."
213,Monica,What didn't you tell us you work here?
214,Joey,"It's kind of embarrassing, y'know."
215,Joey,"I mean, I was an actor and now I'm a waiter."
216,Joey,It's supposed to go in the other direction.
217,Chandler,So is your apron.
218,Chandler,You're wearing it like a cape.
219,Joey,"I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know?"
220,Joey,I guess I'm going to be hanging out here anyway.
221,Joey,"I might as well get paid for it, right?"
222,Joey,I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
223,Rachel,"Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine."
224,Ross,"Yeah, why would it be weird?"
225,Ross,"Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?"
226,Joey,"Okay, I guess it doesn't seem that weird."
227,Ross,"Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven't gotten it."
228,Joey,"See, now it's weird again."
229,Chandler,I think it's great that you work here.
230,Chandler,"You're going to make a lot of money, and here's your first"
231,Rachel,"Well, you know what?"
232,Rachel,This is great.
233,Rachel,"Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too."
234,Rachel,Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse.
235,Rachel,"First of all, the customer is always right."
236,Rachel,A smile goes a long way.
237,Rachel,And if anyone is ever rude to you?
238,Rachel,Sneeze muffin.
239,Joey,"Thanks, Rach."
240,Joey,"Look, you guys are just terrific."
241,Joey,Y'know?
242,Joey,"Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers."
243,Joey,It's all about turnover.
244,Ross,"Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?"
245,Joey,"Oh, I'm sorry, Ross."
246,Joey,I'll get it for you right now.
247,Joey,"And since I made you wait, I'll toss in a free muffin."
248,Rachel,Phoebe.
249,Rachel,We would like to talk to you for a second.
250,Phoebe,Okay.
251,Monica,"So, maybe I am a little high maintenance."
252,Monica,And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover.
253,Monica,But you know what we decided you are?
254,Rachel,"Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky."
255,Monica,Hah!
256,Phoebe,"That true, I am flaky."
257,Rachel,"So, what, you're just, you're just okay with being flaky?"
258,Phoebe,"Yeah, totally."
259,Monica,"Well, then, I'm okay with being high maintenance."
260,Rachel,"Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover."
261,Phoebe,That's great.
262,Phoebe,Good for you guys.
263,Monica,I am not high maintenance!
264,Rachel,I am not a pushover!
265,Phoebe,Who said you were?
266,Phoebe,Monica and
267,Rachel,You did!
268,Phoebe,"Oh, I'm flaky."
269,Phoebe,I'll say anything.
270,Joey,"Hey, Gunther."
271,Joey,"Can you uh, can you cover for me?"
272,Joey,I just got an audition.
273,Joey,Really?!
274,Joey,I like your natural color.
275,Joey,"Come on man, it's a great part."
276,Joey,"Look, check it out."
277,Joey,I'm the lead guy's best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat.
278,Joey,Listen-listen.
279,Joey,"I'm sorry, that seat's saved.'"
280,Joey,"Okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but"
281,Joey,"Oh, man, I could totally get that part."
282,Joey,"I'm sorry, that seat is taken.'"
283,Joey,"No, no, I didn't mean you."
284,Joey,"But, you believed me, huh?"
285,Joey,"So, you'd hire me, right?"
286,Joey,Exactly!
287,Joey,"All right, everybody, listen up."
288,Joey,The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
289,Joey,"Yeah, it's for the kids."
290,Joey,To keep the kids off drugs.
291,Joey,It's a very important issue in this month's Playboy.
292,Joey,I'm sure you all read about it.
293,Ross,It's my joke.
294,Chandler,It's my joke.
295,Chandler,Ross and
296,Chandler,It's my joke.
297,Ross,"Y'know, I don't think we're going to settle this."
298,Chandler,Let's have Monica decide.
299,Ross,Yeah!
300,Chandler,Yeah!
301,Ross,Hey Mon.
302,Chandler,"Mon, get out here!"
303,Ross,Monica!
304,Chandler,"Okay, okay."
305,Chandler,You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
306,Monica,Why do I have to decide?
307,Chandler,Because you're the only one that can be fair.
308,Ross,Yeah.
309,Monica,I can't be fair.
310,Monica,You're my boyfriend.
311,Ross,"Yeah, but I'm your brother."
312,Ross,We're family.
313,Ross,That's the most important thing in the world.
314,Chandler,Don't try to sway her.
315,Chandler,I'm your only chance to have a baby.
316,Chandler,"Okay, let's go."
317,Ross,We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truthme.
318,Monica,"Okay, Chandler, you go first."
319,Chandler,"Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve."
320,Monica,"Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?"
321,Chandler,Can I finish my story?
322,Monica,Do you want me to pick you?
323,Ross,"See, I would never snap at you like that."
324,Monica,Continue.
325,Chandler,So Steve said he had to go to the doctor.
326,Chandler,And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy.
327,Chandler,"So I said, Doctor Monkey?'"
328,Chandler,And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.
329,Ross,Are you kidding?
330,Ross,"Okay, look."
331,Ross,I-I studied evolution.
332,Ross,"Remember, evolution?"
333,Ross,Monkey into man?
334,Ross,"Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey."
335,Ross,I'm Doctor Monkey!
336,Chandler,I'm not arguing with that.
337,Monica,"All right, I've heard enough."
338,Monica,I've made my decision.
339,Monica,You are both idiots.
340,Monica,"The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys!"
341,Monica,"You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world!"
342,Monica,Now let it go!
343,Monica,The joke sucks!
344,Ross,It's your joke.
345,Chandler,Is not.
346,Monica,"Hi, Chandler."
347,Monica,There you are.
348,Chandler,"Hi, oh hi."
349,Monica,"Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel."
350,Monica,"Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?"
351,Chandler,"Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady."
352,Chandler,Being with her has been like being on a vacation.
353,Chandler,And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail andgenerosity of spirit.
354,Rachel,"Wow, you know what?"
355,Rachel,That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.
356,Phoebe,Really?
357,Phoebe,I've heard better.
358,Monica,"Wait, wait, he came up with that himself."
359,Monica,"Tell them, Chandler."
360,Chandler,I'm out of words.
361,Chandler,Should I just say the whole thing again?
362,Monica,"Look, I am not high maintenance."
363,Monica,I am not.
364,Monica,Chandler!
365,Chandler,You're a little high maintenance.
366,Monica,Ahhh!
367,Monica,You are on my list.
368,Chandler,I'm sorry.
369,Chandler,"You're not easy-going, but you're passionate, and that's good."
370,Chandler,"And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good about making you feel better about that."
371,Chandler,And that's good too.
372,Chandler,"So, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because I like  maintaining you."
373,Monica,I didn't even tell him to say that.
374,Monica,All right you're off my list.
375,Chandler,I'm off the list.
376,Monica,"Phoebe, it's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend."
377,Phoebe,"Y'know, suddenly I find you very attractive."
378,Chandler,"Hey, buddy boy, how'd the audition go?"
379,Joey,"Not good, no."
380,Joey,"I didn't get the part, and I lost my job here, so"
381,Phoebe,Wow!
382,Phoebe,That is a bad audition.
383,Rachel,How-how did you lose your job here?
384,Joey,"Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed."
385,Joey,"So, I went anyway, and then he fired me."
386,Rachel,He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you've been working here two days?
387,Rachel,"That's not, that's not right."
388,Joey,"Yeah, what are ya gonna do?"
389,Rachel,"Joey, you can't let him get away with that."
390,Rachel,"Ya know what, I'm not going to let him get away with that."
391,Rachel,"I'm going to say something to himNo, I really shouldn't say anythingNo, I should say something to him."
392,Rachel,"Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back."
393,Rachel,That is really not fair that you have to fire him
394,Rachel,What?
395,Rachel,"That's right, he can have his job back."
396,Rachel,I'm glad we got that all straightened out.
397,Rachel,"There you go, Joey, you got your job back."
398,Joey,That's great.
399,Joey,Thanks Rach.
400,Rachel,"Yeah, pretty nice, huh?"
401,Rachel,Now who's a pushover?
402,Phoebe,"Rach, you're in my seat."
403,Rachel,"Oh, I'm sorry."
404,Rachel,Ending Credits
405,Phoebe,"Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend."
406,Monica,"I pick you, Phoebe."
407,Rachel,"Oh, yeah."
408,Rachel,"Definitely you, Pheebs."
409,Phoebe,"Yeah, well, I kinda thought."
410,Chandler,Hey.
411,Rachel,Hey.
412,Rachel,"Oh, I have a question."
413,Rachel,"If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?"
414,Ross,No way.
415,Joey,I'm not answering that.
416,Chandler,Joey!
417,Chandler,No way.
418,Chandler,I'm not answering that.
419,Chandler,End
0,Ross,"So I told Carl, Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.'"
1,Ross,But of course this went in one ear and out.....
2,Rachel,I love how he cares so much about stuff.
3,Rachel,If I squint I can pretend he's Alan Alda.
4,Monica,"Oh good, another dinosaur story."
5,Monica,When are those gonna become extinct?
6,Chandler,"If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best."
7,Phoebe,Who's singing?
8,Phoebe,Opening Credits
9,Ross,Hey.
10,Ross,"When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you?"
11,Ross,I was always Richie.
12,Monica,I was always Joanne.
13,Joey,Question.
14,Joey,"Was ah, Egg the Gellers!'"
15,Joey,the war cry of your neighbourhood?
16,Phoebe,Ewww!
17,Phoebe,Oh!
18,Phoebe,It's the Mattress King!
19,Joey,Booo!
20,Chandler,Don't look honey.
21,Chandler,Change the channel!
22,Chandler,Change the channel!
23,Chandler,What a wank!
24,Monica,I know!
25,Monica,"And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves."
26,Monica,And I'm appalled for you by the way.
27,Monica,Matress
28,Rachel,Okay.
29,Rachel,"Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night."
30,Rachel,Okay bye-bye.'
31,Ross,We?
32,Rachel,"Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that's okay."
33,Ross,"Oh shoot, tomorrow's not so good, I'm supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat."
34,Ross,Sorry.
35,Rachel,"Ross, my father doesn't hate you."
36,Ross,"Please, he refers to me as wethead'."
37,Rachel,But honey he calls everybody by a nickname!
38,Rachel,"Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please."
39,Rachel,I just want him to love you like I do.
40,Rachel,"All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I'll love you like I do in that black thing that you like."
41,Chandler,I'll go.
42,Ross,Fine.
43,Rachel,Thank you.
44,Ross,Hi Gunther.
45,Joey,"Hey, you guys!"
46,Phoebe,Hey!
47,Joey,Guess what?
48,Ross,What?
49,Joey,I got a gig!
50,Chandler,"See, that's why I could never be an actor."
51,Chandler,Because I can't say gig.
52,Phoebe,"Yeah, I can't say croissant."
53,Phoebe,Oh my God!
54,Monica,What's the part?
55,Joey,"Well, it's not a part, no."
56,Joey,I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.
57,Ross,Come on!
58,Ross,That's great.
59,Joey,"Yeah, yeah."
60,Joey,It's like my chance to give something back to the acting community.
61,Ross,Y'know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
62,Joey,I know!
63,Phoebe,Ugh!
64,Phoebe,I don't know Monica.
65,Phoebe,It feels funny just being here.
66,Phoebe,"I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler."
67,Monica,Not at these prices.
68,Phoebe,Hi.
69,Phoebe,Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store.
70,Phoebe,Woo!
71,Monica,Oh!
72,Monica,Ohhhhh!
73,Monica,Oh!
74,Monica,"Phoebe, come here."
75,Monica,"Aw, this is my new bed."
76,Monica,You gotta feel this bad boy.
77,Phoebe,"Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend...  Oh!"
78,Phoebe,Oh my God!
79,Phoebe,"Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends."
80,Joey,Good evening.
81,Joey,I'm Mr. Tribbiani.
82,Joey,And I will be teaching acting for soap operas.
83,Joey,"Now um, on my first day as  Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives,  I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did."
84,Joey,And it goes like this.
85,Joey,"Thanks, thanks, a lot."
86,Joey,"Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive."
87,Joey,"All right, moving right along."
88,Joey,Hi!
89,Phoebe,Hey!
90,Phoebe,Ooh!
91,Phoebe,How was teaching last night?
92,Joey,Oh it was great.
93,Joey,"Yeah, you get to say stuff like, 'Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you, I dismiss you.'"
94,Phoebe,"Ooooh, nice."
95,Joey,"Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children."
96,Phoebe,"Oh, yay!"
97,Joey,"Yeah, it's this great part, this boxer named Nick."
98,Joey,"And I'm so, so right for it, y'know, he's just like me."
99,Joey,"Except he's a boxer, and has an evil twin."
100,Phoebe,Oh.
101,Phoebe,Okay.
102,Phoebe,"Oh, do I have a middle name."
103,Phoebe,All right Monica Velula Geller.
104,Phoebe,It's that bedroom there.
105,Joey,"Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?"
106,Phoebe,"Yeah, so please, please, please, don't say anything to Chandler."
107,Joey,You want me to lie to Chandler?
108,Phoebe,Is that a problem?
109,Joey,No.
110,Phoebe,"Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let's see what you got."
111,Phoebe,"All right ya, put em up."
112,Phoebe,Come on.
113,Joey,"Hey, you're ah, pretty good at this."
114,Phoebe,"Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren't acting Christian enough."
115,Joey,Ahh!
116,Joey,Hey now!
117,Joey,Hey!!!
118,Joey,Oww!!
119,Joey,And I'm bleeding.
120,Phoebe,Oh!
121,Phoebe,Oh!
122,Phoebe,Oh!
123,Joey,"Okay, great."
124,Phoebe,Wow!
125,Phoebe,And I'm a vegetarian!
126,Phoebe,"All right, all right, well I'm sorry, we'll put some ice on it."
127,Joey,Okay.
128,Phoebe,"Kay, put your head back."
129,Joey,All right.
130,Joey,I can't see.
131,Phoebe,"All right, I have ya."
132,Phoebe,Oh God.
133,Phoebe,"Oh, it's the compulsively neat one by the window, okay."
134,Rachel,Hi Daddy!
135,Rachel,Dr.
136,Rachel,You remember Ross.
137,Rachel,Dr.
138,Ross,Nice to see you again Dr. Green.
139,Ross,Dr.
140,Ross,"Ugh, museum."
141,Ross,Dr.
142,Ross,There never was a library.
143,Ross,"I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one."
144,Ross,Dr.
145,Ross,"Yeah, if you're really hungry."
146,Ross,"It was a joke, I made a joke."
147,Rachel,"Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster."
148,Rachel,Dr.
149,Ross,It's not a library... Dr.
150,Ross,"So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat."
151,Ross,Dr.
152,Ross,It gives it a nice antiquey look.
153,Ross,Dr.
154,Ross,Wow.
155,Ross,"I'm sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that."
156,Ross,Dr.
157,Rachel,Okay.
158,Ross,Okay!
159,Rachel,Aw honey stop!
160,Rachel,It's not that bad.
161,Ross,Yeah.
162,Ross,Op!
163,Ross,Uh-oh!
164,Ross,I think your Dad must've added wrong.
165,Ross,He only tipped like four percent.
166,Rachel,Yeah.
167,Rachel,That's Daddy.
168,Ross,That's Daddy?!
169,Ross,But doesn't it bother you?
170,Ross,You're a waitress.
171,Rachel,"Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers."
172,Ross,So?
173,Rachel,So.
174,Rachel,"Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change."
175,Ross,You really serve people sneezers?
176,Rachel,"Well um, I don't."
177,Rachel,Dr
178,Ross,"Thanks again, Dr. Green."
179,Ross,Dr.
180,Ross,"Oh, ah, you don't need that."
181,Ross,Dr.
182,Ross,"The carbon, it's messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness."
183,Ross,Dr.
184,Ross,"Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it's a sickness really."
185,Rachel,"Yeah it is, it is."
186,Rachel,"We really, really have to do something about that."
187,Ross,I know.
188,Ross,Dr.
189,Rachel,"Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't."
190,Ross,"Nothing I do means anything, really."
191,Ross,Dr.
192,Ross,Well Mr. Big Shot is better than wethead'.
193,Joey,"Okay, some tricks of the trade."
194,Joey,"Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling."
195,Joey,"Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil."
196,Joey,"That would be the basic I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it'  Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13."
197,Joey,And that's how it's done.
198,Joey,"Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed."
199,Joey,Hey-hey.
200,Joey,"Awww, one of my students got an audition."
201,Joey,I'm so proud.
202,Joey,You bet!
203,Joey,What's the part?
204,Rachel,"You had to do it, didn't you?"
205,Rachel,You couldn't just leave it alone.
206,Ross,Four percent.
207,Ross,Okay.
208,Ross,I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
209,Rachel,"Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along."
210,Rachel,"Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already."
211,Ross,"Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall."
212,Ross,"Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?"
213,Phoebe,"I'm, I'm freaking out!"
214,Phoebe,Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have!
215,Phoebe,"All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something."
216,Phoebe,Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
217,Rachel,Um.
218,Rachel,yeah.
219,Phoebe,I am soo dead.
220,Rachel,"All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay."
221,Rachel,"So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice."
222,Ross,"Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work."
223,Rachel,"Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here."
224,Ross,"Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say Like me!"
225,Ross,Like me tiny doctor!'
226,Rachel,"Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross?"
227,Rachel,For me?
228,Rachel,For me?
229,Ross,Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything.
230,Ross,"You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along."
231,Rachel,"Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay."
232,Rachel,"Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!"
233,Ross,"Okay, okay, okay."
234,Ross,I'll get the bagels.
235,Monica,What's this?
236,Phoebe,Isn't it cool!
237,Phoebe,Varoom!
238,Phoebe,Varoom!

240,Phoebe,"I know, you must've won like a contest or something!"
241,Monica,Phoebe!
242,Monica,Why is this car in my bedroom?
243,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, okay, I-I wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it..."
244,Monica,When did I sign for it?
245,Phoebe,When I was you!
246,Phoebe,"Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, cause he left his nose open!"
247,Monica,Did you make brownies today?
248,Chandler,"Knock, knock."
249,Monica,"Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed."
250,Chandler,"Hey, I'm going for sushi does anybody want..  Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp."

257,Chandler,"Okay, well it this bed isn't new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?"
258,Monica,Sometimes I have bad dreams.

261,Joey,That was... Tweezers?
262,Joey,Whoa.
263,Joey,That was really good.

265,Joey,"Well, I-I might've said supergay."
266,Chandler,You totally screwed him over.
267,Monica,"Joey, you're this guy's teacher."
268,Monica,I mean how could you do this?
269,Joey,"Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part."

327,Ross,Excellent!
328,Joey,There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor.
329,Joey,"I had such an opportunity in the recent, present."
330,Joey,"And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually."
331,Joey,"Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him."

304,Ross,"Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight."
305,Rachel,"Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight."

29,Monica,"Wait a minute, she isn't She's not the one who you"
30,Joey,Who you what?

41,Joey,What?
42,Rachel,No we weren't!
43,Rachel,It was nothing!
44,Rachel,"It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y'know, ended upkissing for a bit."
45,Ross,So that's two of my wives.
46,Ross,Opening Credits
47,Monica,Okay so this is where the band is.
48,Monica,And this is where the bar is.
49,Monica,And all these pins have people's names on them.
50,Monica,"And Rach, here you are."
51,Rachel,Oh wow.
52,Rachel,"Why don't we just take me  and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender."
53,Rachel,These pins aren't for playing are they?
54,Monica,"Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours."
55,Chandler,This is so sad.
56,Chandler,"I mean, I only have like ten pins."
57,Monica,"Chandler, relax it's not a contest."
58,Monica,Certainly not a close one.
59,Joey,Hello!
60,Rachel,Hey!
61,Joey,Hey Rach.
62,Rachel,Stop picturing it!
63,Monica,"Okay, I think that's it."
64,Monica,The seating chart is done.
65,Monica,This is our wedding.
66,Monica,They all look like they're having fun don't they?
67,Joey,"Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?"
68,Monica,Oh!
69,Monica,"Let's see, wellif this is the wedding hall then umm  you're parents will be at home in Queens."
70,Joey,What they're not invited?!
71,Joey,"Oh no, that's terrible!"
72,Joey,They're gonna be crushed!

74,Joey,You got me.
75,Joey,I don't

86,Chandler,Y'know I think we should invite them.
87,Monica,"Oh please, you just want more blue pins."
88,Chandler,Well this is just sad!
89,Monica,"All right, all right."
90,Monica,Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging.
91,Monica,"But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!"
92,Rachel,That is not a problem.
93,Joey,Maybe you'll order a little sangria?
94,Rachel,"Oh, get out of here!"
95,Rachel,"So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal."
96,Rachel,Anything at all.
97,Rachel,But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
98,Chandler,"Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach."
99,Chandler,I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
100,Rachel,I'm Monica's maid of honor.
101,Rachel,Okay?
102,Rachel,Don't try to blue pin me!
103,Chandler,"Well, what's the deal with these?"
104,Chandler,These-these look nice.
105,Rachel,Oh they are nice.
106,Rachel,We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send em back.
107,Chandler,You mean like for award shows?
108,Rachel,Some of them.
109,Chandler,"You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, ""You are you wearing?!"
110,Chandler,"You look fabulous!"""
111,Rachel,"Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!"
112,Chandler,"Okay, who wore those?"
113,Rachel,"Umm, well let's see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw."
114,Chandler,Not bad.
115,Rachel,This one is uh Paul O'Neil.
116,Chandler,Who's that?
117,Rachel,He plays for the Yankees.
118,Rachel,"Seriously, ESPN!"
119,Rachel,"Just once and a while, have it on in the background."
120,Rachel,"Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!"
121,Chandler,Pierce Brosnan?
122,Rachel,Uh-huh.
123,Chandler,Are you serious?
124,Rachel,Yeah.
125,Chandler,007?!
126,Chandler,This is James Bond's tux?
127,Rachel,Yeah.
128,Chandler,"Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux!"
129,Rachel,It's a pretty cool tux.
130,Chandler,"Oh, it's not just that, I would be England's most powerful weapon."
131,Chandler,Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty's secret service.
132,Chandler,A man who fears no one; with a license to kill.
133,Chandler,Would Monica let me wear this?
134,Joey,We should really learn how to play the real way.
135,Phoebe,I like our way.
136,Phoebe,Oh!
137,Phoebe,Chess!
138,Joey,Nice move.
139,Phoebe,Yeah.
140,Rachel,Hey!
141,Joey,Hey!
142,Phoebe,Hey!
143,Rachel,"So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?"
144,Joey,"No, I'm performing the ceremony."
145,Joey,I'm not wearing a tux.
146,Rachel,"Well, what are you going to wear?"
147,Joey,Multi-colored robes!
148,Joey,"Ooh, and maybe a hat."
149,Rachel,Huh.
150,Rachel,Does Monica know about this?
151,Joey,I don't think so.
152,Rachel,Can I please be there when you tell her?
153,Phoebe,"Hey oh, Rach wait!"
154,Phoebe,Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
155,Rachel,"Oh, y'know what?"
156,Rachel,I can't.
157,Rachel,I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
158,Joey,Can I come?!
159,Joey,I won't even talk!
160,Joey,You'll just hear the noise from my video camera.
161,Phoebe,What is this?
162,Phoebe,What's going on?
163,Joey,Oh good!
164,Joey,Can I tell her?!
165,Joey,Can I tell her?
166,Rachel,"Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey's lewd version?"
167,Phoebe,Joey's!
168,Joey,Okay
169,Rachel,"Hey, come on!"
170,Rachel,I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one timeshe and I y'knowkissed a little bit.
171,Phoebe,"Yeah, I'm sure that happened."
172,Rachel,It-it did!
173,Phoebe,Sure!
174,Joey,Hey.
175,Joey,It happened!
176,Rachel,"Yeah, it was senior year in college."
177,Rachel,It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk!
178,Rachel,And we ended up kissing!
179,Rachel,For several minutes!
180,Phoebe,Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
181,Joey,Why are you taking this away from me?
182,Rachel,"Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?"
183,Phoebe,Okay!
184,Phoebe,I justI didn't know that you are a lesbian.
185,Rachel,I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian!
186,Rachel,I'm just saying that this happened!
187,Phoebe,"Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you're soy'know sovanilla."
188,Rachel,Vanilla?
189,Phoebe,Yeah.
190,Rachel,I'm not vanilla!
191,Rachel,I've done lots of crazy things!
192,Rachel,I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
193,Phoebe,To Ross.
194,Rachel,"All right, y'know what?"
195,Rachel,"If you don't want to believe me about this, why don't you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you."
196,Phoebe,Okay!
197,Phoebe,All right!
198,Phoebe,Yeah!
199,Phoebe,Cause I just can't picture it.
200,Joey,"Oh-ho, you should get inside my head."
201,Ross,Hey!
202,Ross,Guess what I got for your wedding!
203,Chandler,A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
204,Ross,No.
205,Ross,Rachel hooked me up with a tux!
206,Ross,"But not just any tux, Batman's tux!"
207,Chandler,What?
208,Ross,That's right!
209,Ross,Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit filmthat Batman film he was in.
210,Chandler,You can't wear that!
211,Chandler,I'm wearing the famous tux!
212,Chandler,James Bond's tux!
213,Ross,So?
214,Chandler,SoIf you wear that you'll make mine less special.
215,Ross,"Well, you need something to make this day special?"
216,Ross,Hello!
217,Ross,You-you-you have the most special thing of all!
218,Ross,You are marrying the woman you love.
219,Chandler,"Please, don't take away my cool thing."
220,Chandler,Please?!
221,Chandler,Pretty please?
222,Ross,Pretty please?
223,Ross,"Not very uh, 007."
224,Chandler,"Look, it's my wedding day okay?"
225,Chandler,If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
226,Ross,When I got married you slept with my sister.
227,Chandler,That was pretty 007.
228,Joey,Hey.
229,Monica,Hey.
230,Monica,Oh good-good you're here!
231,Monica,"All right, I figured it out."
232,Monica,"I'm gonna take two tables of eight, I'm gonna add your parents, and I'm gonna turn them into three tables of six."
233,Monica,Okay?
234,Monica,"And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!"
235,Joey,"Yeah, they're not coming."
236,Monica,What?
237,Joey,Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me.
238,Joey,Theyfeel a little unwanted.
239,Monica,Oh that's too bad.
240,Monica,"It's true, but too bad."
241,Joey,"Look Mon, if you could just call my mom"
242,Monica,Oh Joey!
243,Joey,Come on!
244,Joey,Look just-just telllet her know that you really want them to be there.
245,Joey,"Let's not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years."
246,Monica,No she hasn't.
247,Joey,Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
248,Monica,"Well, what am I going to say?"
249,Joey,I don't know.
250,Joey,"Just uh, just tell em it was a mix-up with the invitations, orNo-no-no!"
251,Joey,Blame it on the post office.
252,Joey,They hate the post office.
253,Joey,And the Irish!
254,Joey,But I don't think you can blame it on them so
255,Monica,Hello?
256,Monica,"Yeah, hi!"
257,Monica,Mrs. Tribbiani?
258,Monica,"Hi, this is Monica Geller."
259,Monica,"Yeah I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding."
260,Monica,"Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered."
261,Monica,"Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office!"
262,Monica,T-Tell me about it!
263,Monica,"Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office?"
264,Monica,"No, more like US lost office!"
265,Monica,What are they Irish?
266,Rachel,Oh.
267,Rachel,"Oh, that's great!"
268,Phoebe,Of course!
269,Phoebe,"Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon."
270,Phoebe,Yeah!
271,Phoebe,"Y'know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning."
272,Rachel,"Anyway, speaking of drinking too much."
273,Rachel,"I was uh, tellin' Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out."
274,Rachel,Remember?!
275,Rachel,"Wecome on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops"
276,Rachel,we went back the house and we got really silly and wewe made out.
277,Phoebe,Really?!
278,Phoebe,Commercial Break
279,Chandler,Ross is Batman!
280,Monica,"Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time."
281,Chandler,Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman.
282,Chandler,Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
283,Monica,What are you talking about?!
284,Monica,007 has all those gadgets!
285,Chandler,Batman has a utility belt!
286,Monica,007 has a fancy car!
287,Chandler,Batman has the Batmobile!
288,Monica,007 gets all the ladies.
289,Chandler,Batman has Robin!
290,Chandler,We get ESPN right?
291,Monica,How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I'll make you a nice martini.
292,Chandler,"Actually, I don't like martinis."
293,Monica,How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
294,Chandler,"Ooh, yum!"
295,Joey,Hey.
296,Monica,Hey.
297,Joey,"Listen, I know the invitation says"

303,Joey,"I mean, weddings start late."
304,Joey,Right?
305,Monica,Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
306,Joey,Ah.
307,Joey,Yeah.
308,Joey,"Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me."
309,Joey,Cause my part's just in the beginning I'm not even in the rest of the showWedding!
310,Monica,The wedding starts at six.
311,Joey,Okay.
312,Joey,"Okay, I totally hear ya."
313,Joey,Oo how about this?
314,Joey,I vamp a little til they get there?
315,Monica,You'll vamp?
316,Joey,Yeah!
317,Joey,"Yeah y'know, like warm up the crowd."
318,Joey,Ask em where they're from.
319,Joey,Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer.
320,Joey,I'm a minis-tainer!
321,Joey,There is no one better!
322,Joey,There is no one greater!
323,Rachel,How can you not remember us kissing?
324,Rachel,Wh Come on!
325,Rachel,Remember?
326,Rachel,We were on the sleeping porch!
327,Rachel,We couldn't stop giggling?
328,Rachel,And our coconuts kept knockin' together?
329,Phoebe,"Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding."
330,Rachel,"Yeahbut come onListen, I'm sorry I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn't believe me."
331,Rachel,No!
332,Phoebe,"Rachel, it's okay."
333,Phoebe,You don't have to do this.
334,Phoebe,I believe you.
335,Phoebe,All right?
336,Phoebe,"Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa."
337,Rachel,Thank you Phoebe.
338,Phoebe,I know.
339,Ross,Hey!
340,Monica,You just carry that around?
341,Ross,Yes.
342,Ross,I find it to be something of a conversation piece.
343,Monica,Between you and
344,Ross,Gunther.
345,Ross,Hey-hey!
346,Ross,Why don't we put them on?
347,Ross,Y'know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
348,Chandler,I would but mine doesn't fit.
349,Chandler,The pants are a little tight.
350,Monica,A little tight?
351,Monica,I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
352,Ross,Well that stinks.
353,Ross,I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
354,Chandler,"Well, does that mean that you're not going to wearing yours?"
355,Ross,What are you kidding?
356,Ross,It's Batman's tux!
357,Chandler,Let me try it on!
358,Ross,"Okay, but just the jacket."
359,Ross,Double-oh and seven are not gettin' in there.
360,Chandler,Okay.
361,Chandler,Holy double-vented comfort Batman!
362,Chandler,What's this?
363,Ross,What?
364,Chandler,An invitation for the At First Sight premiere?
365,Chandler,Oh my God!
366,Chandler,Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman!
367,Chandler,He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
368,Ross,Let me see that!
369,Ross,Oh man!
370,Chandler,The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
371,Joey,Hey!
372,Joey,"Uh, Monica?"
373,Joey,Chandler?
374,Joey,Can I talk to you guys for a second?
375,Monica,"All right that's it, I give up!"
376,Monica,Whatever you want you can have it!
377,Monica,You wanna sing a song?
378,Monica,You wanna do a dance?
379,Monica,You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs?
380,Monica,I don't care!
381,Joey,No!
382,Joey,"No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet."
383,Joey,They're so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
384,Monica,Oh.
385,Chandler,"Well, you're welcome."
386,Chandler,And tell them we're really glad they're coming.

420,Rachel,Oh does it matter?!
421,Rachel,All that matters is that you look so handsome.
422,Chandler,Whose is it?
423,Rachel,I don't want to say.
424,Chandler,"Oh, come on!"

9,Monica,"All right, umm, we're not gonna really keep it this way though."
10,Rachel,No?
11,Phoebe,"No, we're gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette."
12,Rachel,Oh!
13,Phoebe,"And also, we don't know what to do with this."
14,Joey,"Oh yeah, I definitely know her."
15,Joey,Opening Credits

19,Monica,"Wow, Monica!"
20,Monica,What an amazing opportunity to influence dozens of people.
21,Phoebe,"How could you say yes, what about our catering business?"
22,Monica,"Oh no-no-no, it's only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners."

49,Joey,"You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?"
50,Ross,"Joey, you are gonna love this guy."
51,Ross,Gandolf is like the party wizard!
52,Joey,"Well, why do you call him Gandolf?"
53,Ross,Gandolf the wizard.
54,Ross,Hello!
55,Ross,Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
56,Joey,"No, I had sex in high school."
57,Rachel,"Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something."
58,Rachel,There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss
59,Rachel,"Well, actually, I meant for me."
60,Rachel,The hiring committee is meeting people all day and
61,Rachel,"God, I am so glad you don't have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn't even consider applying."
62,Rachel,And that's I'm so glad there's no problem.
63,Rachel,Ohh!
64,Rachel,That's great!
65,Rachel,Really?
66,Rachel,"Well, I, umm"
67,Chandler,Oh man!
68,Chandler,I am so excitedI may vomit!
69,Joey,"Will you calm down, he's just a human guy."
70,Chandler,"Look you don't understand, Gandolf is amazing."
71,Chandler,"Y'know you're never know what's gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!"
72,Joey,Really?
73,Chandler,"Oh yeah, it's beautiful country up there."
74,Ross,Hey!
75,Ross,Okay!
76,Ross,"I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!"
77,Chandler,It's not gonna be exactly like last time.
78,Joey,"All right, I'll see you guys."
79,Joey,Chandler and
80,Ross,Whoa-whoa-whoa!
81,Chandler,Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
82,Joey,"I have an audition, but I'll definitely hook up with you later."

85,Joey,Okay.
86,Chandler,Hello.
87,Chandler,It's Gandolf!!!
88,Chandler,"So, are you in town?"
89,Chandler,"Oh, well, well maybe next time then."
90,Ross,What happened?
91,Chandler,"He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago."
92,Ross,"Ohh, man!"
93,Ross,"Chicago, is sooo lucky!"
94,Chandler,"Stupid, useless Canadian money!"
95,Rachel,Thank you.
96,Rachel,"Well, they uh, they-they do more than that."
97,Rachel,Mrs.
98,Rachel,"Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me."
99,Rachel,"I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that."
100,Rachel,"Yes, I realize that"
101,Rachel,I love working with designers!
102,Monica,Hey!
103,Monica,My first review is out!
104,Phoebe,Ohh!
105,Phoebe,"Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm."
106,Monica,"All right, look at my on the back page."
107,Phoebe,"Oh, okay!"
108,Phoebe,"""Would I go back to Allesandro's?"
109,Phoebe,"Sure, but I'd have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head."""
110,Phoebe,Wow!
111,Phoebe,You really laid into this place.
112,Monica,"Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends."
113,Phoebe,"Ooh, I gotta go."
114,Phoebe,I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.
115,Monica,Oh!
116,Monica,Do you need me to go with you?
117,Phoebe,"No-no, it's okay."
118,Phoebe,But are we sure we don't want the waterbed?
119,Monica,Haven't we made this decision?
120,Phoebe,"Yeah, all right."
121,Monica,Bye!
122,Phoebe,Bye!
123,Monica,Who is it?
124,Monica,Oh my God.
125,Monica,"Oh my God, oh my God."
126,Monica,Call me on the phone!
127,Monica,"Look, I-I'm never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away."
128,Phoebe,"Hey, do you need to get in?"
129,Phoebe,Here you go.
130,Monica,No!
131,Monica,Phoebe!
132,Phoebe,"Hey, Monica!"
133,Phoebe,Commercial Break
134,Monica,I couldn't eat it!
135,Monica,"I had five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books."
136,Monica,The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
137,Monica,"All right, that I'll retract."
138,Monica,"But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it."
139,Monica,You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice!
140,Monica,You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
141,Monica,Oh my God!
142,Monica,You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?!
143,Monica,Where are you even from?
144,Monica,"Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like!"
145,Monica,"Come on, hand me them."
146,Rachel,"Umm, Joanna?"
147,Rachel,I wanna talk about that interview.
148,Rachel,No!
149,Rachel,It didn't!
150,Rachel,That's what I want to talk to you about.
151,Rachel,"Now, just to brief you  I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you."
152,Rachel,There's nobody here!
153,Rachel,Do you want me to quit?
154,Rachel,"Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant."
155,Rachel,Y'know what?
156,Rachel,"I am just gonna pack up my desk,  and I will be gone by the end of the day!"
157,Rachel,"Well, I guess there's no use to me sticking around til the end of the day!"
158,Rachel,What?
159,Rachel,My drinking?
160,Rachel,Said what?
161,Rachel,Exactly.
162,Rachel,Oh my God!!
163,Rachel,"Ohh, that is it!"
164,Rachel,I'm leaving!
165,Rachel,You are just a horrible person!
166,Rachel,Say more things like that.
167,Rachel,I'd need an expense account.
168,Rachel,And an assistant.
169,Joey,Hey!
170,Joey,What are you guys doing here?
171,Joey,I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.
172,Ross,"It's Gandolf, and he's not coming."
173,Joey,So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'?
174,Ross,No!
175,Ross,I balanced my checkbook.
176,Chandler,"Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players."
177,Ross,I can't believe he didn't come!
178,Joey,So what if he didn't come!
179,Joey,We can still go out and party ourselves!
180,Chandler,"Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night!"
181,Ross,Yeah!
182,Ross,"We'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!"
183,Joey,"Well, we could do that!"
184,Ross,There's other stuff too.
185,Joey,"We'll do it all, and better!"
186,Joey,"Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude!"
187,Joey,Come on!
188,Ross,Yeah!
189,Joey,Yeah!
190,Ross,Yeah!
191,Joey,Yeah!
192,Ross,It's not like we don't know how to party!
193,Joey,Yeah!
194,Joey,All right?
195,Joey,Let's go!
196,Chandler,And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
197,Chandler,Joey and
198,Ross,Yeah!!
199,Chandler,All right!
200,Ross,"Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?"
201,Chandler,"Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?"
202,Ross,Yeah.
203,Chandler,"Well, those were seals, man."
204,Rachel,"Hey Mon, little question for ya!"
205,Rachel,How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
206,Monica,"Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!"
207,Rachel,Oh my God!!
208,Rachel,"You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm soo happy!"
209,Monica,Can you believe it?
210,Monica,I finally get to run my own kitchen!
211,Rachel,"Ohh, you've waited soo long."
212,Phoebe,Hey!
213,Rachel,"Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya."
214,Phoebe,Yeah.
215,Rachel,How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?
216,Phoebe,"I don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and  You got the job!"
217,Rachel,Yes!!
218,Monica,You got the job?!
219,Monica,Why didn't you tell me?
220,Rachel,"Ohh, it's gonna be so great!"
221,Rachel,"I'm gonna get to help decide what we sell, I'm gonna have an office with walls and everything."
222,Rachel,I'm gonna have walls!
223,Phoebe,"Okay, is this the day of good news or what?"
224,Phoebe,I got us a job!
225,Phoebe,The wedding reception.
226,Monica,Ohh!
227,Monica,"Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that."
228,Monica,"Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering."
229,Phoebe,But we've only had one job.
230,Monica,"I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it's snowballing, y'know?"
231,Phoebe,Yeah!
232,Phoebe,What are you saying?
233,Monica,I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro's.
234,Phoebe,What?
235,Monica,"It's okay, cause y'know what?"
236,Monica,You don't really need me for the business.
237,Phoebe,You're the cook!
238,Phoebe,With out you it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and asking for money!
239,Monica,All right.
240,Monica,"But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van."
241,Phoebe,For what?
242,Phoebe,I can't believe this!
243,Phoebe,I gotta get out of here.
244,Monica,"Phoebe, wait a minute!"
245,Rachel,I'm an assistant buyer!
246,Joey,"All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out."
247,Chandler,"Yeah, all right."
248,Ross,Okay.
249,Joey,"So, we're having fun, right?"
250,Joey,Chandler and
251,Ross,Yeah.
252,Joey,We don't need that wizard guy.
253,Joey,"We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing."
254,Ross,I'm kinda beat.
255,Chandler,"Actually, me too."
256,Joey,Are you serious?!
257,Joey,Chandler and
258,Ross,Yeah.
259,Joey,Thank God!
260,Joey,I'm exhausted!
261,Joey,"Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf."
262,Ross,"Yeah, me too."
263,Chandler,"Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon?"
264,Chandler,I think I strained my voice screaming in there.
265,Chandler,Does it have to be so loud?
266,Joey,"I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad."
267,Ross,"I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know?"
268,Ross,"I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place."
269,Ross,How sad are we?
270,Joey,"Yeah, I know."
271,Chandler,Y'know what?
272,Chandler,"We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore."
273,Chandler,Y'know?
274,Chandler,"I'm 29 years old, damnit!"
275,Chandler,"And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!"
276,Chandler,Joey and
277,Ross,Yeah!
278,Joey,Yeah!
279,Joey,And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
280,Joey,Chandler and
281,Ross,Yeah!
282,Ross,"And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!"
283,Joey,"We're 29, we're not women."
284,Monica,"Ohh, here you are."
285,Monica,"Y'know, I'm-I'm glad you decided to hear me out."
286,Phoebe,"Okay, I'm hearing."
287,Monica,I've been doing a lot of thinking.
288,Monica,A lot!
289,Monica,"And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van."
290,Monica,"Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person."
291,Phoebe,What?
292,Monica,Or!
293,Monica,A bakery delivery person.
294,Phoebe,I wa-I wa-I wa
295,Monica,Pizza?
296,Phoebe,Monica!
297,Monica,"All right, I've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver."
298,Phoebe,No.
299,Monica,Okay.
300,Monica,"I'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either."
301,Phoebe,No.
302,Monica,"Y'know what, let's do the catering business."
303,Phoebe,Really?!
304,Phoebe,Are you sure?
305,Monica,"Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you."
306,Monica,"Y'know what, it'd be, it'd be fun."
307,Phoebe,Oh!
308,Phoebe,It will be fun!
309,Phoebe,Ohh!
310,Phoebe,Yay!
311,Phoebe,Oh!
312,Phoebe,"Okay, ooh, let's plan the wedding reception."
313,Phoebe,Wow!
314,Phoebe,You really wanted me to do something with this van.
315,Phoebe,"Y'know what, I want you to take the chef job."
316,Monica,Really?
317,Phoebe,Yeah.
318,Phoebe,That's what you really want.
319,Phoebe,"Yeah, I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don't want to be the reason I'm unhappy."
320,Monica,Thank you.
321,Phoebe,"Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team."
322,Rachel,"Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch!"
323,Rachel,Is Joanna in already?
324,Rachel,Mrs.
325,Rachel,Heard what?
326,Rachel,Mrs.
327,Rachel,Oh my God!
328,Rachel,How?!
329,Rachel,Mrs.
330,Rachel,Oh my God!
331,Rachel,"Oh, I cannot believe it!"
332,Rachel,Mrs.
333,Rachel,"Oh, God."
334,Rachel,"Oh, God."
335,Rachel,Oh God.
336,Rachel,Mrs.
337,Rachel,"Yes, so close."
338,Rachel,"Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us."
339,Rachel,But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before it happened.
340,Rachel,Mrs.
341,Rachel,"Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with usnothing about an assistant buyer?"
342,Rachel,Mrs.
343,Rachel,"Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna"
344,Monica,"Umm, I just wanna say, uh  that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe...  Are you gonna kill me?"
345,Monica,End
0,Rachel,"Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left."
1,Monica,"Oh, I ordered mine first."
2,Chandler,"Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster..."
3,Monica,Give it to me.
4,Chandler,No.
5,Monica,Give it to me.
6,Chandler,"Ok, you can have it."
7,Monica,"There you go, enjoy your coffee."
8,Chandler,That was there when I got here.
9,Phoebe,"Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York."
10,Monica,"Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow."
11,Phoebe,"Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy."
12,Rachel,You went out with a guy in the Navy?
13,Phoebe,"Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park."
14,Phoebe,Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.
15,Joey,"Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?"
16,Phoebe,No.
17,Phoebe,"No, he is my submaring guy."
18,Phoebe,He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together.
19,Phoebe,Only this time he's coming for two weeks.
20,Phoebe,"Two whole weeks, which means yay."
21,Rachel,"So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?"
22,Monica,That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
23,Ross,Hiii.
24,Joey,"Oh no, what happened?"
25,Ross,"Well, I just spoke to Carol."
26,Ross,Ben's got the chicken pox.
27,Ross,"Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it."
28,Rachel,Well I've had it.
29,Joey,"Yeah, I've had it."
30,Monica,Had it.
31,Chandler,Had it.
32,Phoebe,"Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out."
33,Phoebe,Oh look!
34,Phoebe,OPENING TITLES
35,Monica,"Honey, you made the bed again."
36,Monica,"I told you, you don't have to do that."
37,Monica,This isn't camp.
38,Monica,Baddest.
39,Monica,Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.
40,Monica,Just waiting for you sweetie.
41,Monica,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
42,Monica,"You know what, the way you did it was just fine."
43,Monica,"If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy."
44,Monica,"Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner."
45,Monica,I'm just easing you in.
46,Monica,"Alright, you see these little flower blossoms?"
47,Monica,"They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be."
48,Monica,You don't love me any more do you.
49,Monica,Really?
50,Monica,"Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point."
51,Chandler,"Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor."
52,Joey,But don't you need experience for a job like that?
53,Chandler,It's not that hard to learn.
54,Chandler,"And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor."
55,Chandler,"Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor."
56,Chandler,Hey thanks.
57,Chandler,"Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni."
58,Chandler,"Joey is a uh, fellow processor."
59,Joey,Oh yeah yeah.
60,Joey,I process.
61,Joey,"People want the processing, I'm the one they call."
62,Joey,"Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things."
63,Joey,You know how it is.
64,Joey,"One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more."
65,Chandler,I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
66,Joey,Ha-ha.
67,Joey,Are all you processors dorks?
68,Rachel,"Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you."
69,Monica,"You look fabulous honey, you really do."
70,Phoebe,Yeah?
71,Phoebe,"Are you sure, really."
72,Rachel,"You see, you look beautiful."
73,Rachel,"For god sakes, dim the lights."
74,Phoebe,"I, I, I'm hideous."
75,Monica,It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water.
76,Monica,He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.
77,Phoebe,Come in.
78,Phoebe,"Hey Ryan, what's up?"
79,Phoebe,"Well, no no, you have to stay back."
80,Phoebe,"I, I have the pox."
81,Phoebe,Chicken.
82,Phoebe,Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
83,Phoebe,"'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox."
84,Phoebe,"Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are."
85,Phoebe,"Ohh, ohh."
86,Phoebe,"Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now."
87,Phoebe,Nope.
88,Phoebe,You don't want to see a face covered with pox.
89,Phoebe,And you hate fish.
90,Phoebe,Oh.
91,Phoebe,"That's so sweet, alright."
92,Phoebe,"Ok, alright, you can see."
93,Phoebe,"This is me...  Oh, I am scary."
94,Phoebe,I hate this.
95,Phoebe,"'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this."
96,Phoebe,"Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had."
97,Joey,Hey.
98,Chandler,"Hey, how's the first day goin'?"
99,Joey,Pretty good.
100,Joey,It's like you said.
101,Joey,It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
102,Chandler,Well there you go.
103,Joey,Hey and everbody is so nice.
104,Joey,"I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie."
105,Chandler,"Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?"
106,Joey,"Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school."
107,Joey,Small world huh?
108,Chandler,Weird world.
109,Chandler,Your kids?
110,Joey,I figure my character has kids.
111,Chandler,Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
112,Joey,"Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that."
113,Joey,"My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany."
114,Joey,Ashley copies everything Brittany does.
115,Chandler,"Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes."
116,Joey,Yeah.
117,Joey,"Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid..."
118,Joey,Ya know what?
119,Joey,Just did.
120,Chandler,Really?
121,Chandler,Wow.
122,Chandler,That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
123,Phoebe,That you don't stop talking about it.
124,Phoebe,"Let's just play, ok. Good, ok."
125,Phoebe,"Here we go, double sixes, here we go..."
126,Phoebe,"Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice..."
127,Phoebe,No.
128,Phoebe,"This is what I do for luck, ok."
129,Phoebe,No.
130,Phoebe,No.
131,Phoebe,Here.
132,Phoebe,There.
133,Phoebe,"Ooh, double sixes."
134,Phoebe,"Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it."
135,Phoebe,It's just so hard.
136,Phoebe,I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body.
137,Phoebe,Give it.
138,Phoebe,"Yeah, come on."
139,Phoebe,"You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on."
140,Phoebe,"Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good."
141,Phoebe,"Now do me, do my back."
142,Phoebe,"Oh come on, harder."
143,Rachel,"Oh, stop that, stop that right now."
144,Ross,"You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man."
145,Joey,You and Milton have to join us on the boat.
146,Joey,"Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it."
147,Joey,"Oh, thanks, thanks."
148,Joey,Bye bye Jeannie.
149,Joey,What a phony.
150,Chandler,"Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing."

152,Joey,Sir.
153,Joey,MR.
154,Chandler,Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
155,Chandler,MR.
156,Joey,"Yeah Bing, what's that about?"
157,Chandler,"It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale."
158,Chandler,"Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday."
159,Chandler,MR.
160,Joey,This company was not built on rough numbers.
161,Joey,Am I right Mr. Douglas.
162,Joey,MR.
163,Chandler,"Uh, if you say so sir."
164,Joey,"Joseph's good, isn't he?"
165,Chandler,"Well, I'm going to kill you."
166,Joey,"Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up."
167,Joey,"Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers."
168,Chandler,Why?
169,Joey,"Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok."
170,Joey,"If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it."
171,Joey,"'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say."
172,Monica,This is for the scratchy twins out there.
173,Monica,I taped oven mits to their hands.
174,Monica,It's for their own good.
175,Monica,Exactly.
176,Monica,"Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now."
177,Monica,Tell me the truth.

179,Monica,Very good.
180,Monica,You know what.

184,Monica,"See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast."
185,Monica,You wanna know why?
186,Monica,"No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now."
187,Monica,No.
188,Monica,See you don't understand.
189,Monica,No.
190,Monica,You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.
191,Monica,Oh yeah.
192,Monica,"Alright, well tell me one of yours."
193,Monica,What if they get mixed up?
194,Monica,You would not.
195,Monica,I can't believe this.
196,Monica,"I hate this, you're too normal."
197,Monica,I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
198,Monica,My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
199,Joey,Hey.
200,Joey,Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
201,Chandler,Why?
202,Chandler,Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
203,Joey,'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
204,Chandler,"Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?"
205,Joey,Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph.
206,Joey,"But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you."
207,Joey,"Anyway, I just thought you should know."
208,Chandler,"Alright, that's it."
209,Chandler,"Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go."
210,Joey,"What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph."
211,Chandler,"I don't, I hate Joseph, ok."
212,Chandler,I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
213,Joey,Oh yeah.
214,Joey,Well you can't fire Joseph.
215,Joey,"You know why, 'cause he's not in your department."
216,Chandler,"Alright, ok, alright."
217,Chandler,"So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife."
218,Joey,Karen.
219,Chandler,"Yeah, Karen."
220,Chandler,I'm thinking about having an affair with her.
221,Chandler,"Oh, you know what?"
222,Chandler,I just did.
223,Joey,Ahh.
224,Joey,What the hell are you doing to me man.
225,Chandler,"Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy."
226,Chandler,Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler.
227,Chandler,"In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer."
228,Joey,Really?
229,Chandler,"No freakshow, she's fictional."
230,Joey,Take it easy.
231,Joey,"If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else."
232,Chandler,Thank you.
233,Joey,"It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph."
234,Joey,I liked him.
235,Joey,"His wife, she was hot."
236,Phoebe,Can I please take these off?
237,Phoebe,I swear I won't scratch.
238,Rachel,"No sorry hon, Monica's orders."
239,Ross,"Ok, dinner's on."
240,Rachel,And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you.
241,Ross,"Alright you kids, bye now."

1,Rachel,Oh myGod!
2,Rachel,Let me see that!
3,Joey,You fall for it every time!
4,Phoebe,Hey!
5,Rachel,Hi!
6,Phoebe,I brought you my old maternity clothes!
7,Rachel,"Oh Pheebs that's so sweetOoh, those are so cute!"
8,Phoebe,Yeah!
9,Phoebe,"And look,  see how they expand as the baby grows?"
10,Phoebe,"And then after the baby's born, they're great for shoplifting melons."
11,Monica,Oh good you're all here.
12,Monica,"Thanksgiving tomorrow, four o'clock."
13,Monica,"Oh, guess who I invited."
14,Monica,Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?
15,Rachel,No.
16,Monica,He was in Ross's classmarching bandkinda overweight?
17,Monica,"Well, really overweight."
18,Monica,I mean I was his thin friend.
19,Rachel,Wow!
20,Rachel,I don't remember him.
21,Rachel,"Honey, are you sure you're not talking about your imaginary boyfriend."
22,Monica,No that was Jarred!
23,Monica,Wow!
24,Monica,"I haven't thought about him in a long time   Anyway, umm Will's, Will's here on business and he didn't have a place to go so I invited him here."
25,Rachel,Oh that's nice.
26,Monica,"Oh, and by the way, he's lost a bunch of weight."
27,Monica,I mean he looks goo-ood!
28,Monica,"Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous!"
29,Monica,I still love Chandler.
30,Joey,I just want you to say it once in a while.
31,Monica,"All right okay, just so you know, I'm not gonna make a turkey this year."
32,Joey,What?
33,Monica,Well Phoebe doesn't eat turkey
34,Joey,Phoebe!
35,Phoebe,"Turkey's are beautiful, intelligent animals!"
36,Joey,No they're not!
37,Joey,They're ugly and stupid and delicious!
38,Monica,All right!
39,Monica,"Okay, it's just Phoebe."
40,Monica,"Will's still on a diet, Chandler doesn't eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel's having her aversion to poultry."
41,Joey,She is?
42,Rachel,Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
43,Joey,Yeah.
44,Joey,But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
45,Monica,"Anyway, it just doesn't seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people."
46,Monica,Okay?
47,Monica,It's a lot of work.
48,Joey,But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving!
49,Joey,"I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie!"
50,Joey,Or Friday with no two pizzas!
51,Monica,All right fine!
52,Monica,If it means that much to you!
53,Monica,But justthere's gonna be a ton left over.
54,Joey,No there won't!
55,Joey,I promise I will finish that turkey!
56,Monica,"All right, you're telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?"
57,Joey,That's right!
58,Joey,Cause I'm a Tribbiani!
59,Joey,And this is what we do!
60,Joey,"I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don't read a lot or run very fast, but damnit!"
61,Joey,We can eat!
62,Joey,Opening Credits
63,Monica,"Hey, isn't weird to think about how next year at this time they'll be a little baby at the table?"
64,Monica,Rachel's!
65,Monica,But good to know where you're at!
66,Phoebe,Hey!
67,Monica,Hey!
68,Phoebe,Happy Thanksgiving!
69,Monica,You too!
70,Phoebe,Anything I can do to help?
71,Monica,Actually there is.
72,Monica,"Chandler usually helps me with this, but he's really into the game so I don't want to bother him."
73,Monica,Could you help me fold these napkins?
74,Phoebe,Sure!
75,Monica,I'm gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.
76,Phoebe,Okay.
77,Monica,No!
78,Monica,No!
79,Monica,No!
80,Monica,No sweetie!
81,Monica,No!
82,Monica,Not like that!
83,Monica,We're not at a barn dance.
84,Monica,You've gottayou wanna fold them like swans.
85,Monica,"Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?"
86,Phoebe,"Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me."
87,Phoebe,So how's the game?
88,Chandler,I have no idea.
89,Phoebe,What?
90,Chandler,Yeah!
91,Chandler,I'm just pretending to watch the game so I don't have to help out with stuff.
92,Phoebe,I don't believe you!
93,Phoebe,That isbrilliant!
94,Phoebe,And Monica has no idea?
95,Chandler,Nope!
96,Chandler,Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.
97,Monica,Is your team winning hon?
98,Chandler,Yeah!
99,Chandler,Anderson just scored again!
100,Chandler,There's no Anderson.
101,Phoebe,Well I want to get in on this.
102,Phoebe,Hey Mon?
103,Phoebe,"I don't think I can help you after all, I didn't realize this game was on."
104,Monica,"Oh, I didn't know you liked football."
105,Phoebe,"Well normally I don't, but y'knowGreen Bay is playing."
106,Monica,You like Green Bay?
107,Phoebe,Well it's only like my favorite bay!
108,Phoebe,"{Actually, it's not bad."
109,Phoebe,"It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to June."

119,Monica,"Chandler, this is Will."
120,Chandler,Oh hey.
121,Chandler,I'd shake your hand but uh; I'm really into the game.
122,Chandler,"Plus, I think it'd be better for my ego if we didn't stand right next to each other."
123,Monica,This is Phoebe.
124,Phoebe,Hey.
125,Phoebe,Wow!
126,Phoebe,Well done.
127,Monica,Wanna give me a hand?
128,Monica,Well you look incredible too!
129,Monica,You're justyou're so fit!
130,Chandler,"I'm watching the game, but I'm not deaf!"
131,Monica,"Oh umm, I meant to tell you, Ross is coming."
132,Monica,Good.
133,Monica,And Rachel Green too.
134,Monica,Is there a problem?
135,Monica,What?
136,Chandler,"Y'know, it's been a while since we've screamed something."
137,Chandler,Maybe we should.
138,Phoebe,Oh okay.
139,Chandler,Oh come on!
140,Phoebe,Noooo!!
141,Phoebe,Damn you ref!
142,Phoebe,You burn in hell!!
143,Monica,"Hey, what are you doing?"
144,Monica,"You gotta save room, you've got almost an entire turkey to eat."
145,Joey,Let me explain to you how the human body works.
146,Joey,I have to warm my stomach first.
147,Joey,Eatin' chips is like stretching.
148,Monica,All right.

163,Ross,Yeah that-that sounds interesting.
164,Ross,Oh!
165,Ross,"Man I don't think I've seen you since uh, Lance Davis' graduation party."
166,Ross,Yeah.
167,Ross,"It would've been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun."
168,Ross,Yeah.
169,Ross,Yeah.
170,Ross,So how long are you in town?
171,Rachel,Hi!

183,Rachel,"He's really got that sexy, smoldering thing going on."
184,Rachel,"Oh my God, he's Look at the way he's just staring at me."
185,Rachel,"I think he's trying to mouth something to me, but I can't make it out."
186,Monica,"Okay, dinner's ready!"

197,Rachel,Hi!
198,Rachel,"Will, right?"
199,Rachel,Hi!
200,Rachel,I'm Rachel Green.
201,Rachel,Really?!

203,Rachel,"I gotta tell you though, I am, I am having the hardest time placing you."
204,Rachel,Oh-oh hang on!
205,Rachel,"Did we umm, did we fool around at Lance Davis' graduation party?"
206,Rachel,Thank you!
207,Monica,Uh Rachel?
208,Monica,"Rachel, why don't you sit here?"
209,Monica,And Will you sit way over there.
210,Joey,That's it?!
211,Joey,Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem.
212,Joey,At least give me a challenge!
213,Monica,This is Chandler's chicken.
214,Monica,This is the turkey.
215,Joey,Oh.
216,Joey,How-how big is that?
217,Monica,About nineteen pounds.
218,Joey,It's like me when I was born.
219,Rachel,"All right, who would uh, like some yams?"
220,Rachel,Will?
221,Rachel,What?
222,Rachel,Oh y'know what?
223,Rachel,Can we please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table?
224,Rachel,The smell is just yuck!
225,Rachel,I'm sorry.
226,Rachel,What?
227,Joey,"Seriously, who is this guy?"
228,Rachel,"Umm, I'm sorry."
229,Rachel,Do you-do you have a problem with me?
230,Phoebe,I think you do.
231,Monica,"Apparently you were umm, a little mean to him in high school."
232,Rachel,I'm-I'mI had no idea.
233,Rachel,I'm sorry.
234,Monica,Oh Will.
235,Monica,But you-you've worked so hard
236,Monica,Okay.
237,Rachel,"Uh Will umm, I just want to say that I'm real sorry for whatever I-I did to you in high school"
238,Rachel,You had a club?
239,Rachel,Whoa!
240,Rachel,My God!
241,Rachel,"So what, you all just joined together to hate me?!"
242,Rachel,Who else was in this club?
243,Ross,"No need to point, she knows who Ross is."
244,Ross,Commercial Break
245,Rachel,So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?
246,Ross,No.
247,Ross,No.
248,Rachel,So who else was in this club?
249,Ross,"Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but I-I don't think he-he knew what it was."
250,Rachel,"So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club."
251,Ross,That was in high school!
252,Ross,It's not like it was binding forever.
253,Rachel,"Okay Monica, did you know about this?"
254,Monica,I swear I didn't.
255,Monica,Hey!
256,Monica,Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?
257,Monica,Ross and
258,Monica,"Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say."
259,Ross,"Look Rach I-I'm sorry, okay?"
260,Ross,"II was a stupid kid, okay?"
261,Ross,The only reason I joined
262,Ross,co-founded.
263,Ross,Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you.
264,Ross,Obviously I didn't handle it very well.
265,Ross,But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.
266,Rachel,Okay.
267,Rachel,So what?
268,Rachel,You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?
269,Ross,No-no!
270,Ross,No-no.
271,Ross,No-no.
272,Phoebe,What?!
273,Phoebe,What else did you do?
274,Rachel,What rumor?
275,Phoebe,"Oh, come on Will!"
276,Phoebe,Just take off your shirt and tell us!
277,Rachel,Ross!
278,Ross,It was no big deal.
279,Ross,We-wesaid that the rumor wasthat ummyou had bothmale and female reproductive parts.
280,Rachel,What?
281,Rachel,Oh my God!
282,Monica,You started that?
283,Rachel,What?!
284,Rachel,You heard that?
285,Monica,Everyone at our school heard it!
286,Chandler,Everybody at my school heard it!
287,Chandler,You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?
288,Rachel,Oh no!!!!
289,Rachel,Oh my God!!
290,Rachel,This is all making so much sense to me now!
291,Rachel,This is why Adam Carter wouldn't go out with me!
292,Rachel,This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region!
293,Ross,"Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now."
294,Ross,So-so that one's not really our fault.
295,Rachel,"Monica, how come you never told me this?"
296,Monica,I thought it might be true.
297,Monica,And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.
298,Rachel,Joey stop staring!
299,Rachel,There's nothing there!
300,Rachel,It's not true!
301,Joey,I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.
302,Rachel,Oh!
303,Joey,You are my Everest.
304,Monica,"Joey, you don't have to finish that."
305,Joey,Oh yes I do.
306,Joey,Otherwise what's next?
307,Joey,"Today I'm just a guy who can't finish a turkey, but tomorrow I'm the guy who eats half a Powerbar, wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge?"
308,Joey,No!
309,Joey,"No, I justI justI gotta change my pants."
310,Joey,Jeans have no give.
311,Rachel,Okay!
312,Rachel,Okay!
313,Rachel,"Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year, ""Dear Rach, you're such a good person."""
314,Rachel,Not girl!
315,Rachel,Person!
316,Ross,"Rach, I think you're reading a little too much into it."
317,Rachel,"""Dear Rach, you're a great person."
318,Rachel,"Sorry about your tiney-wienie."""
319,Ross,"Look, what do you want me to do?"
320,Ross,Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn't true?
321,Rachel,Yes!
322,Monica,Oh!
323,Monica,Me too!
324,Ross,Well look-look I'm not calling anybody!
325,Ross,Okay?
326,Ross,It was like a million years ago!
327,Rachel,I don't care how long ago it was!
328,Rachel,You told people that I was half and half!
329,Rachel,Y'know what?
330,Rachel,I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in high school.
331,Monica,That's not totally true.
332,Rachel,What?
333,Ross,What?
334,Monica,"Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian."
335,Ross,How did you know that?!!!
336,Monica,It's true?!
337,Ross,No.
338,Rachel,Yes it is!
339,Rachel,I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!
340,Chandler,I'm sorry.
341,Chandler,When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?
342,Ross,Hey!
343,Ross,She didn't look 50!
344,Chandler,Did she look 16?
345,Rachel,"Ohh, there's a picture of her in the yearbook actually."
346,Phoebe,Oh!
347,Phoebe,Wow!
348,Ross,She didn't photograph well!
349,Chandler,"Well, she probably wasn't familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!"
350,Phoebe,So how did this happen?
351,Phoebe,"Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?"
352,Ross,I was working late in the library one afternoon.
353,Ross,It was just the two of us.
354,Ross,She needed some help with her word jumble.
355,Ross,And one thing led to another.
356,Ross,"If you must know, Anita was very gentle and tender."
357,Ross,May she rest in peace
358,Monica,Didn't she walk with a cane?
359,Ross,Only when it was damp!!
360,Ross,I can't believe you-you told people about this?!
361,Ross,Everybody knew?!
362,Ross,Y'know what?
363,Ross,I'm back in the club!
364,Phoebe,I wanna join!
365,Rachel,WhPhoebe!
366,Phoebe,I'm sorry.
367,Phoebe,I'm sorry.
368,Phoebe,I never got to be in a club.
369,Phoebe,"I-I didn't go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn French."
370,Phoebe,Bonjour.
371,Rachel,"All right, y'knowFine!"
372,Rachel,"You guys have your stupid little club, but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you!"
373,Rachel,You gave me a tiney-wienie!
374,Monica,"All right, listen you're just being silly."
375,Monica,"Rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you."
376,Monica,One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!
377,Rachel,Wow
378,Monica,"And Ross, if it weren't for Rachel's rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were."
379,Monica,She put you on the map!
380,Ross,As a romancer of the elderly.
381,Monica,Hey!
382,Monica,Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty.
383,Ross,The eyesdid still sparkle.
384,Monica,Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past.
385,Monica,You-you've been through so much since then.
386,Monica,And right now you've got so much more important stuff going on in your life.
387,Monica,Can't you just let this go?
388,Rachel,She's right.
389,Ross,Yeah.
390,Ross,I mean we are having a baby together.
391,Ross,Yeah.
392,Ross,Nope.
393,Phoebe,Okay.

406,Chandler,"Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now."
407,Phoebe,Is there anything we can do for you?
408,Joey,"No just, nobody press on my stomach."
409,Rachel,You can keep those pants by the way.

14,Chandler,Yeah.
15,Joey,You're gonna mess it up let me do it.

61,Monica,"All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?"
62,Chandler,"Wait a minute, all jokes aside?"

72,Ross,"Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it."
73,Ross,You know why?
74,Ross,Because she is very mature.
75,Ross,"Besides, it doesn't really matter to me what you guys think."
76,Ross,"I mean, I'm the one dating Elizabeth, not you!"

231,Rachel,Wh?
232,Joey,"I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!"
233,Rachel,Why would a charity give away a free boat?
234,Joey,I don't know!
235,Joey,Charity?
236,Rachel,Ugh!
237,Phoebe,"Well, just buy the damn boat!"
238,Rachel,"Phoebe, don't you think you've had enough to drink?"
239,Phoebe,I'm just helping the kids!
240,Rachel,How is you drinking helping the kids?
241,Phoebe,"Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink."
242,Phoebe,Mr.
243,Joey,Oh hi!
244,Joey,Mr.
245,Joey,"Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?"
246,Joey,Mr.
247,Joey,"Hey, I was pretty close."
248,Joey,"Uhh, so bad news."
249,Joey,"Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money."
250,Rachel,Joey!
251,Rachel,"Joey, good one!"
252,Rachel,Mr.
253,Joey,"So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now."
254,Rachel,Hey!
255,Rachel,Youcan'tleave Joey!
256,Rachel,"You agreed to buy that boat, all right?!"
257,Rachel,That is a contract!
258,Rachel,"And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!"
259,Joey,"Well, what am I gonna do Rach?!"
260,Joey,I don't have that kind of money!
261,Rachel,I know.
262,Rachel,Okay.
263,Rachel,Okay.
264,Rachel,Okay.
265,Rachel,All right.
266,Rachel,"All right, this is what we're gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference."
267,Joey,Okay.
268,Rachel,Okay.
269,Joey,"Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway!"
270,Joey,Y'know?
271,Joey,They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
272,Rachel,Not great.
273,Monica,"And so, we're hiding in the bathroom."
274,Monica,So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they're going at it right on the bathroom floor.
275,Chandler,"I got a good one, I got a good one!"
276,Chandler,I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
277,Monica,Ohh.
278,Chandler,What?
279,Ross,"Oh my God, you guys!"
280,Chandler,"Before you say anything, have we got a story for you!"
281,Chandler,Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
282,Ross,Who?
283,Chandler,Richard!
284,Ross,What?
285,Ross,A-ohh!
286,Ross,Ohh.
287,Ross,Oh that's right that's right.
288,Ross,That's Richard's favorite place too.
289,Chandler,Oh you knew that.
290,Chandler,Good!
291,Monica,I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
292,Ross,"Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight."
293,Monica,"Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!"
294,Ross,"Y'know, maybe she is too young for me."
295,Ross,"Y'know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter."
296,Ross,I finally started to see what you guys were talking about.
297,Ross,I don't know what to do.
298,Monica,Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff.
299,Monica,I mean that's what I did when I first  weighing stuff.
300,Ross,"Okay umm, bad stuff."
301,Ross,"Well, I'm-I'm 12 years older than she is."
302,Monica,If the school finds out you're fired.
303,Ross,Hmm.
304,Monica,She's leaving for three months.
305,Chandler,For camp!
306,Ross,"Okay, good stuff."
307,Ross,"Umm, well she's-she's sweet and pretty and"
308,Monica,"Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, ""Do you see a future?"""
309,Monica,I mean like do you see yourself marrying her?
310,Monica,Oh my God!
311,Monica,You did it already!
312,Monica,"You married her, didn't you?"
313,Ross,No!
314,Ross,No!
315,Ross,Ididn't do that.
316,Ross,"It's just Okay, honestly no."
317,Ross,"I don't, I don't see a big future with her."
318,Monica,Okay well I thinkthat's your answer.
319,Ross,I've got to talk to her.
320,Ross,"Ugh, I hate this part."
321,Chandler,"Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth."
322,Chandler,I mean if you're not careful you may not get married at all this year!
323,Joey,Rach!
324,Joey,Rachel!
325,Joey,"Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one."
326,Rachel,Oh great!
327,Joey,Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
328,Phoebe,"Oh, okay."

376,Joey,Bowmont!
377,Joey,"Oh my God, you're back!"
378,Phoebe,"Ohh, let me see it!"
379,Phoebe,Let me see your hand!
380,Monica,Why do you want to see my hand?
381,Phoebe,I wanna see what's in your hand.
382,Phoebe,I wanna see the trash.
383,Joey,Yeah.
384,Phoebe,Eww!
385,Phoebe,"Oh, it's all dirty."
386,Phoebe,You should throw this out.
387,Monica,Okay.
388,Chandler,What did you guys just do?
389,Phoebe,What happened?
390,Chandler,Richard was there so I couldn't do it!
391,Joey,What?!
392,Joey,Noooo
393,Chandler,"I'm gonna do it tomorrow y'know, and-and surprise her, but now you've ruined it!"
394,Joey,We didn't ruin it!
395,Chandler,Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?
396,Phoebe,"Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor"
397,Joey,Glove salesman!
398,Phoebe,Good one!
399,Phoebe,Yeah.
400,Chandler,This is terrible.
401,Chandler,What am I going to do?
402,Phoebe,"Look, she only suspects something okay?"
403,Phoebe,"She doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track."
404,Chandler,"That's right, I can throw her off."
405,Chandler,I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
406,Phoebe,Yeah!
407,Phoebe,Yeah!
408,Phoebe,Convince her that-that you're scared of commitment!
409,Phoebe,Convince her that you're a little coward!
410,Chandler,"I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice."
411,Joey,"Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!"
412,Monica,I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
413,Joey,That guy's still doing that?
414,Rachel,Hey!
415,Rachel,"Oh my God you're here, let me see your hand!"
416,Phoebe,"No, you're too late!!!"
417,Phoebe,She already took out the trash!!
418,Ross,Wow!
419,Ross,I have never had such a healthy break-up!
420,Ross,She was such a grown-up about it!
421,Ross,She didn't seem too immature for me!
422,Ross,Did I just make a huge mistake?
423,Ross,"Elizabeth, thank God!"
424,Ross,I was just thinking about
425,Ross,What?
426,Ross,"Okay, break-up's still on!"
427,Chandler,"Okay, okay, here she comes!"
428,Chandler,How do I look?
429,Chandler,Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?
430,Joey,Yeah!
431,Joey,"And also, a little like a French guy."
432,Joey,I never noticed that before.
433,Monica,Hi guys!
434,Joey,Hey!
435,Chandler,Hey!
436,Monica,What are you up too?
437,Chandler,"Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites."
438,Chandler,"Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you."
439,Joey,"Yeah, Big Brother."
440,Monica,Well that's a little crazy.
441,Monica,Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
442,Chandler,"Yeah, well Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?"
443,Monica,Why?!
444,Monica,To celebrate your relationship!
445,Monica,To solidify your commitment!
446,Monica,To declare your love for one another to the world!
447,Chandler,Eh
448,Monica,Okay well that's good to know.
449,Joey,The Mr. Bowmont's here!!
450,Monica,"Sure, I love this part!"
451,Monica,Richard!
452,Monica,"Ohh Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef."
453,Monica,Like I have nothing better to do!
454,Monica,So what's up?
455,Monica,"Oh, good to see you too."
456,Monica,Did you come down here to tell me that?
457,Monica,What uhWhat did youWhat?
458,Monica,Y'know you're really not supposed to be back here!
459,Monica,Oh God  Why don't they put chairs back here?
460,Monica,What the Yes you're too late!
461,Monica,Where was all this three years ago?
462,Monica,What were you doing in Africa?
463,Monica,Ohhh!
464,Monica,What are you doing to me?!
465,Monica,"Oh look, I-I I'm sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen."
466,Monica,Well he is!
467,Monica,"Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about!"
468,Monica,"My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!"
469,Monica,Yeah!
470,Monica,Why?
471,Monica,Because of the government.
472,Rachel,Isn't it incredible?!
473,Rachel,"Monica and Chandler, gettin' married."
474,Phoebe,"I know, they're gonna be so happy together."
475,Rachel,"Ohh I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?"
476,Phoebe,Not that often!
477,Rachel,No!
478,Rachel,I'm so happy for them!
479,Phoebe,Me too!
480,Phoebe,So happy for them!
481,Rachel,I'm so happy and not at all jealous.
482,Phoebe,Oh no!
483,Phoebe,"No God, definitely not jealous!"
484,Rachel,"I mean I'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous."
485,Rachel,And I mean what's 2%?
486,Rachel,That's nothing.
487,Phoebe,Totally.
488,Phoebe,I'm like 90/10.
489,Rachel,Yeah me too.
490,Joey,"Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?"
491,Rachel,"Whno, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille."
492,Monica,"So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?"
493,Chandler,Sure I do.
494,Chandler,"In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural."
495,Chandler,I mean look at pigs.
496,Chandler,Let's take a second here and look at pigs.
497,Chandler,Okay pigs don't mate for life.
498,Chandler,"I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!"
499,Monica,"Yeah, but that's pigs not people!"
500,Chandler,"If marriage worked, I'd be all for it."
501,Chandler,But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is?
502,Chandler,97%.
503,Monica,Wait a minute.
504,Monica,Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
505,Chandler,"Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never."
506,Monica,Oh my God!
507,Monica,Then-then-then what are we even doing?!
508,Monica,What is this?
509,Chandler,Whoa!
510,Chandler,Whoa!
511,Chandler,Whoa!
512,Chandler,What is all this pressure?!
513,Chandler,Is this some new kind of strategy?
514,Chandler,Why don't you put down your copy of The Rules' huh mantrap?
515,Monica,Y'know what?!
516,Monica,I gotta go!
517,Monica,Ugh!
518,Chandler,"It's okay, I got a plan."
519,Rachel,We're gonna find love!
520,Phoebe,Definitely!
521,Rachel,"Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that."
522,Rachel,That's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler!
523,Rachel,It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
524,Phoebe,What do you mean?
525,Rachel,"Well y'know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they're 40, they marry each other."
526,Phoebe,You mean a backup?
527,Rachel,Exactly!
528,Phoebe,"Yeah, yeah I got that."
529,Rachel,You do?
530,Phoebe,Hm-mmm.
531,Rachel,Who?
532,Phoebe,Joey.
533,Rachel,Joey?
534,Phoebe,Yeah!
535,Rachel,Are you serious?
536,Phoebe,"Yeah, I locked him years ago!"
537,Rachel,"Wh So If neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry Joey."
538,Phoebe,"Yep, we shook on it."
539,Phoebe,Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
540,Rachel,"Oh, seriously?"
541,Phoebe,"Ohh, yeah."
542,Phoebe,I think his exact words were
543,Rachel,Charming.
544,Phoebe,"Well hey, it's just a backup."
545,Rachel,Yeah.
546,Joey,Hey Monica!
547,Monica,Have you seen Rachel?
548,Monica,Or a mirror?
549,Joey,"This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?"
550,Monica,"Yeah, it's great."
551,Joey,"Whoa-whoa, what's the matter?!"
552,Joey,Talk to the captain!
553,Monica,I'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead-end relationship!
554,Joey,Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
555,Monica,It's not like I want to get married tomorrow!
556,Monica,"It's just that I-I'd like to believe that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time!"
557,Joey,"Well, you know Chandler."
558,Monica,No I don't know Chandler!
559,Monica,Not anymore!
560,Monica,It's like it's like something's changed.
561,Joey,Maybe you changed?
562,Monica,I didn't change!
563,Joey,Maybe that's the problem.
564,Monica,What?
565,Joey,"Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife."
566,Monica,Is that some kind of boat talk?
567,Joey,I don't know!
568,Joey,I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
569,Monica,What does he think?
570,Monica,Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?
571,Joey,"Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage."
572,Joey,And-and always will be!
573,Monica,Well there's some people who do want to marry me.
574,Joey,There are?
575,Monica,Yeah!
576,Monica,Richard!
577,Joey,R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?!
578,Joey,And-and Chandler's tellin' ya how much he hates marriage?
579,Monica,That's right.
580,Joey,Chandler loves marriage!
581,Monica,You just told me that he hates marriage!
582,Monica,That-that he's a-a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife!
583,Monica,That-that he's against marriage and always will be!
584,Joey,You got that from what I said?
585,Ross,What happened you guys?
586,Ross,Rach!
587,Rachel,Hey you!
588,Ross,"Hey, come on in."
589,Rachel,Oh thank you.
590,Rachel,"Hey y'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth."
591,Ross,"Oh, thanks."
592,Ross,"Yeah, I really thought we'd be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn't meant to be."
593,Rachel,"Yeah, love."
594,Rachel,It's a tricky business isn't it?
595,Ross,I guess so.
596,Rachel,So what do you say we make a pact?
597,Rachel,"If you and I are both single by the time we're 40, we get married."
598,Rachel,"I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we've-we've already slept together so y'know there'll be no surprises there!"
599,Rachel,You know what I mean?
600,Rachel,"No like, ""What's that?!"""
601,Ross,Right.
602,Ross,Ohh!
603,Ross,You-you want me to be your backup.
604,Rachel,Exactly.
605,Ross,"Ohh, yeah I already have one."
606,Rachel,What?
607,Rachel,Who?
608,Ross,Phoebe.
609,Rachel,Phoebe?!
610,Rachel,"Wait abut-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup."
611,Ross,"Ohh, I don't think so."
612,Rachel,Ross!
613,Rachel,"I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!"
614,Ross,That's impossible!
615,Ross,I mean we have had a deal for years!
616,Ross,"We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that."
617,Joey,Where the hell have you been?
618,Chandler,I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
619,Joey,Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
620,Chandler,What?
621,Joey,Yeah!
622,Joey,"Yeah, I've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these  damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!"
623,Chandler,MyOh my God!
624,Joey,I know!
625,Joey,They suck!
626,Chandler,He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him!
627,Chandler,I'm supposed to do that!
628,Joey,I know!
629,Chandler,Well what Y'know what I'm gonna do?
630,Chandler,I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass!
631,Chandler,Will you help me?
632,Joey,"Look, Chandler I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution."
633,Joey,Okay?
634,Joey,Just go and find Monica!
635,Chandler,You're right.
636,Joey,Yeah!
637,Chandler,Okay.
638,Chandler,I'm gonna get the ring!
639,Chandler,I'm gonna get the ring!
640,Chandler,I'm gonna go find her and  I'm just going to propose!
641,Joey,Okay.
642,Chandler,Okay great.
643,Joey,Dude-dude-dude!
644,Chandler,What?
645,Joey,"Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat."
646,Joey,Commercial Break
647,Monica,Hi.
648,Monica,I don't know why I'm here.
649,Monica,I don't know.
650,Monica,Chandler is such an idiot!
651,Monica,"Yeah, I'll have a scotch"
652,Monica,Still smoking cigars?
653,Monica,"No that's, that's okay."
654,Monica,"Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago."
655,Monica,Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don't like my new eye doctor.
656,Monica,Edward Nevski?
657,Monica,No.
658,Monica,But getting over was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do.
659,Monica,And I never let myself think about you.
660,Rachel,Phoebe!
661,Rachel,You picked Joey and Ross?!
662,Rachel,You can not have two backups!
663,Phoebe,Of course I can!
664,Phoebe,It's just good sense to backup your backup!
665,Phoebe,"Look, I've already lost Chandler!"
666,Rachel,What?
667,Joey,Hey!
668,Ross,Hey!
669,Joey,Phoebe!
670,Joey,We're both  your backup?
671,Ross,"Phoebe, how could you do this to me?"
672,Phoebe,I don'tLook I don't know what you're complaining about now?
673,Phoebe,You were both aware of the situation!
674,Joey,No we weren't!
675,Ross,I was not!
676,Phoebe,"Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we're married!"
677,Rachel,Phoebe you can't have both of them!
678,Rachel,You have to pick one!
679,Joey,Pick me!
680,Ross,No!
681,Ross,Pick me!
682,Ross,I don't want to end up an old maid!
683,Phoebe,"All right well let's see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boatThis is hard!"
684,Joey,This is crazy!
685,Joey,"Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!"
686,Ross,"Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!"
687,Phoebe,No wait!
688,Phoebe,JustOkayJust wait!
689,Phoebe,You guys!
690,Phoebe,Wait you guys!
691,Phoebe,"Don't make any rash decisions, okay?"
692,Phoebe,"Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week."
693,Rachel,"Oh God, Phoebe!"
694,Phoebe,I'm talking about massages.
695,Rachel,Oh.
696,Rachel,"Okay, y'know what?!"
697,Rachel,I know-I know how to settle this!
698,Rachel,"All right here, this is what we're gonna do!"
699,Rachel,I'm gonna write Joey on one napkin  and I'm gonna right Ross on the other napkin  and we are going to pick one!
700,Rachel,And that person is going to be our backup!
701,Rachel,Okay?
702,Joey,Okay that's fair.
703,Ross,All right.
704,Phoebe,Good!
705,Rachel,Pick one.
706,Phoebe,Left!
707,Phoebe,Thank you.
708,Rachel,You're welcome.
709,Phoebe,Ross!
710,Rachel,Joey!
711,Rachel,We should just switch.
712,Phoebe,Yeah absolutely!
713,Joey,Yeah.
714,Monica,"I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!"
715,Monica,Oh!
716,Monica,Him.
717,Monica,I missed this apartment!
718,Monica,"Now, this is a grown-up's apartment!"
719,Monica,"Y'know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?"
720,Monica,"Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore!"
721,Monica,I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do!
722,Monica,"I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that!"
723,Monica,"Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!"
724,Monica,Fair?
725,Monica,Please don't even talk to me about fair!
726,Monica,Fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then!
727,Monica,Or fair would've been Chandler wanting to marry me now!
728,Monica,"Believe me, nothing about this is fair!"
729,Monica,Nothing!
730,Monica,Nothing!
731,Monica,Nothing!
732,Monica,Nothing!
733,Monica,Nothing!
734,Monica,Nothing!
735,Monica,Nothing!
736,Monica,Nothing!
737,Monica,Nothing!
738,Monica,Nothing!
739,Monica,Nothing.
740,Monica,I don't knUmm.
741,Monica,I don't know.
742,Monica,Umm
743,Monica,"Y'know, I-I I have to figuresome stY'know, some stuff before I can"
744,Chandler,Where is she?
745,Chandler,I'm not scared of you!
746,Chandler,"Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster?"
747,Chandler,"Ha-ha, Monica!"
748,Chandler,Monica!
749,Chandler,Well where did she go?
750,Chandler,"Oh my God, I can't believe this!"
751,Chandler,"Y'know, I thoughtI thought you were a good guy."
752,Chandler,Nothing happened?
753,Chandler,Nothing?
754,Chandler,So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her?
755,Chandler,Y'know what?
756,Chandler,I can't believe this!
757,Chandler,Do you know what you did?
758,Chandler,My girlfriend is out there thinking things over!
759,Chandler,You made my girlfriend think!
760,Chandler,And what does she have to think about?
761,Chandler,I love her!
762,Chandler,But I am willing to offer her all those things.
763,Chandler,"This was just a plan, y'know?"
764,Chandler,"A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!"
765,Chandler,"It was working until you showed up, you big tree!"
766,Chandler,"I mean, this isn't fair."
767,Chandler,You had your chance with her!
768,Chandler,You had your chance and you blew it!
769,Chandler,And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other!
770,Chandler,And this is all just been one stupid mistake!
771,Chandler,I was gonna propose tonight.
772,Chandler,Yeah I even  got a ring.
773,Chandler,Did you get a ring?
774,Chandler,Y'know Richardyou are a good guy.
775,Joey,Dude!
776,Chandler,"I can't talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!"
777,Joey,She's gone.
778,Chandler,What?
779,Joey,She's gone.
780,Joey,She had a bag and she left.
781,Chandler,What are you talking about?
782,Joey,She was all crying.
783,Joey,"She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think."
784,Chandler,Well why didn't you stop her?!
785,Chandler,Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan?
786,Joey,I-I did!
787,Joey,"I told her everything, Chandler!"
788,Joey,But she wouldn't believe me.
789,Chandler,Well where Where did she go?
790,Joey,To her parent's I think and she said you shouldn't call her.
791,Joey,But if I were you I would.
792,Chandler,I can't believe I ruined this.
793,Joey,I am so sorry man.
794,Monica,You wanted it to be a surprise.
795,Chandler,Oh my God.
796,Monica,Chandler In all my life I never thought I would be so lucky.
797,Monica,As tofall in love with my bestmy best There's a reason why girls don't do this!
798,Chandler,Okay!
799,Chandler,Okay!
800,Chandler,Okay!
801,Chandler,"Oh God, I thought  Wait a minute, I-I can do this."
802,Chandler,I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it.
803,Chandler,"Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you,  you make me happier than I ever thought I could be."
804,Chandler,"And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way."
805,Chandler,"Monica, will you marry me?"
806,Monica,Yes.
807,Monica,I knew you were likely to take a wife!
808,Joey,Can we come it yet?!
809,Joey,We're dying out here!
810,Monica,Come in!
811,Monica,Come in!
812,Monica,We're engaged!!
813,Rachel,"Ohhh, this is the least jealous I've ever been!"
814,Phoebe,"Oh no wait no, this is wrong!"
815,Phoebe,Ross isn't here!
816,Monica,Oh
817,Rachel,"Oh hell, he's done this three times!"
818,Rachel,He knows what its about!
819,Joey,Yeah!
820,Joey,Ending Credits
0,Joey,Hey.
1,Chandler,"Hi, my name's Chandler."
2,Chandler,I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?
3,Joey,"Sure, neighbor come on in."
4,Chandler,"So, is Janine around?"
5,Joey,"Uh, no, she's at dance class."
6,Chandler,Can I check out what she did to my room?
7,Joey,"Yeah, but, hey look, don't go through her stuff."
8,Joey,She gets really mad.
9,Chandler,Oh my God.
10,Chandler,What is th it's like a guy never lived in here.
11,Chandler,"Look, you've got to be careful."
12,Chandler,This girl thing is dangerous.
13,Chandler,It's spreading already.
14,Joey,It is??
15,Chandler,"Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?"
16,Joey,No.
17,Chandler,"Is that your tiny little box, that's too small to put anything in?"
18,Joey,No.
19,Chandler,No!
20,Chandler,"Ok, this is not good."
21,Chandler,You are a guy.
22,Chandler,Ok?
23,Chandler,This is a guys place.
24,Chandler,"If you let this go, you're going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff."
25,Joey,"All right, you're right."
26,Joey,I'll talk to her.
27,Chandler,Yes talk to her.
28,Chandler,Be a man.
29,Joey,I'm a man.
30,Chandler,Defend yourself.
31,Joey,Hmm.
32,Monica,Chandler come on.
33,Monica,We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
34,Chandler,Be right there sweetums.
35,Chandler,A totally different situation.
36,Chandler,Opening Credits
37,Monica,Hey guys.
38,Chandler,"Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?"
39,Monica,It was okay.
40,Monica,She's still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
41,Chandler,"Ohh, yeah."
42,Ross,"Well, is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary?"
43,Monica,Yeah.
44,Ross,The one that always stares at me when I come in?
45,Monica,"No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way."
46,Ross,Still I could tell.
47,Ross,She was into me.
48,Ross,"Well, why don't you set us up?"
49,Rachel,"Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone?"
50,Rachel,Does she have a wedding dress?
51,Phoebe,Hey.
52,Rachel,Hey.
53,Phoebe,Rachel?
54,Rachel,Yeah.
55,Phoebe,"I'm, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients."
56,Phoebe,"So, can I come to Bloomingdale's and use the copy machine."
57,Rachel,"Well, sure, but they might think it's kinda weird considering I don't work there anymore."
58,Phoebe,Oh my God.
59,Phoebe,What happened?
60,Rachel,"I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren."
61,Phoebe,Well that's great!
62,Phoebe,Congratulations!
63,Rachel,Yeah.
64,Rachel,A year ago..
65,Phoebe,You've lasted a whole year.
66,Phoebe,Good for you.
67,Rachel,"But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work."
68,Rachel,"But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn't see you."
69,Rachel,Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn't like me very much.
70,Chandler,That's weird.
71,Chandler,I don't think my boss likes me either.
72,Monica,I don't think mine likes me either.
73,Ross,Maybe it's a universal thing?
74,Joey,"Or maybe, it's because you're hanging around here at"
75,Chandler,Yeah let's head off to work.
76,Monica,We should go.
77,Phoebe,Thank you.
78,Rachel,Sure.
79,Phoebe,Now you will not believe this.
80,Phoebe,"But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in."
81,Rachel,Oh my God.
82,Rachel,Did you talk to him?
83,Phoebe,Yeah a little.
84,Phoebe,He seems really nice.
85,Phoebe,Good kisser.
86,Rachel,What?
87,Rachel,What!?!
88,Rachel,You kissed him?
89,Phoebe,Totally.
90,Rachel,Phoebe are you serious?
91,Phoebe,Yeah.
92,Phoebe,I was just in there.
93,Phoebe,"He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we're making out."
94,Phoebe,You know.
95,Rachel,"Phoebe, I mean, you do know he's married?"
96,Phoebe,No!
97,Rachel,Phoebe
98,Phoebe,What am I supposed to do?
99,Phoebe,Ask every guy I make out with if he's married?
100,Phoebe,"No, yeah, I should."
101,Joey,Hey.
102,Joey,"Uh, can I talk to you for a second?"
103,Joey,"This, uh, kid in this picture."
104,Joey,"Do you, uh, know this kid?"
105,Joey,Is that like a relative or something?
106,Joey,"Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.."
107,Joey,"Okay, uhhLook Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff."
108,Joey,It'stoo girly.
109,Joey,Like this.
110,Joey,Pictures of cute babies we don't know.
111,Joey,We..we can't have that.
112,Joey,Look I don't know this baby.
113,Joey,I don't know if she's a famous artist or not.
114,Joey,"You know, and I don't want to be a jerk but you're changing too much around here."
115,Joey,Yeah but it's too much stuff.
116,Joey,"You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can."
117,Joey,"I'm sure it's a famous watering can, okay."
118,Joey,"But, come onand what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?"
119,Joey,"Ohh, well, that's ok then."
120,Joey,"But, okay my towels for instance."
121,Joey,I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it.
122,Joey,It's up here on some hook..andsmells different.
123,Joey,"Yeah, well, it feels different."
124,Joey,"Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towelsAlso what is with these chips you bought?"
125,Joey,Well that's like summer in a bowl.
126,Rachel,"Oh, Kim, Hi."
127,Rachel,"So you know, II handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought."
128,Rachel,"Ahh.SoWowThe spring line, it's really going to be great this year, huh?"
129,Rachel,So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room.
130,Ross,Hey guys.
131,Ross,Chandler and
132,Monica,Hey.
133,Ross,What's up?
134,Chandler,You knowOh My God.
135,Monica,What happened to your teeth.
136,Ross,I whitened them.
137,Chandler,Really.
138,Ross,Yeah.
139,Ross,What do you think.
140,Monica,"Well, I think I shouldn't look directly at them."
141,Ross,"Come on, seriously."
142,Monica,"Ross they're really, really, really white."
143,Chandler,"Yeah, what was wrong with your oldhuman teeth."
144,Ross,"Ahh, I-I did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to."
145,Monica,How much longer?
146,Ross,A-A day.
147,Monica,Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
148,Ross,I know.
149,Ross,That's why I did it.
150,Ross,"Come on, are they really that bad?"
151,Chandler,"No, no no no."
152,Chandler,You'll be fine.
153,Chandler,"Hillary's bind, right?"
154,Monica,She will be after tonight.
155,Chandler,Yeah.
156,Ross,"Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh"
157,Rachel,Yeah.
158,Rachel,Your teeth?
159,Rachel,"Yes, I saw them from outside."
160,Rachel,You guys are never going to believe this.
161,Rachel,"But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren."
162,Chandler,What??
163,Monica,Oh my god.
164,Rachel,Yeah I know.
165,Rachel,She ran into him at my office and they justmade out.
166,Rachel,"And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she'd heard all year."
167,Chandler,I am proud of all my friends today.
168,Monica,"My God, Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren."
169,Monica,"Ohh, I'm so jealous."
170,Chandler,"Hi, I'm Chandler."
171,Chandler,Your live-in boy
172,Monica,"Chandler, please, come on."
173,Monica,Look at him.
174,Chandler,"Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish."
175,Phoebe,Hey.
176,Phoebe,Here.
177,Phoebe,"Ohh, who's the silver fox?"
178,Rachel,That-that is your make out buddy.
179,Rachel,Don't you recognize him?
180,Rachel,Oh wait.
181,Rachel,"Ohh, Phoebe I love you."
182,Rachel,Kiss me please.
183,Phoebe,That's not Ralph Lauren.
184,Phoebe,Sounds like him though.
185,Rachel,What?
186,Phoebe,"Yeah, no, Ralph doesn't look anything like that guy."
187,Phoebe,He's-he's young and he's got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.
188,Rachel,"Oh My God, Phoebe, that's not Ralph Lauren."
189,Rachel,That's Kenny the copy guy.
190,Phoebe,What?
191,Rachel,Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren.
192,Rachel,"If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more."
193,Rachel,Phoebe!
194,Phoebe,Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?
195,Rachel,To get you to make out with him!!
196,Phoebe,Ohhh.
197,Monica,"Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white."
198,Monica,Nope.
199,Monica,"Okay, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple."
200,Ross,I don't know what I'm going to do.
201,Ross,That date starts in like an hour.
202,Monica,"Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter."
203,Monica,Your teeth wouldn't look so bright.
204,Ross,Oh great.
205,Ross,So all I need to do is get some new skin.
206,Ross,Thank you.
207,Monica,"I'm just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you."
208,Ross,Whoa.
209,Ross,Whoa.
210,Ross,Whoa.
211,Ross,We're not 13 anymore.
212,Monica,Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
213,Ross,"But, won't she notice I have makeup on?"
214,Monica,Please.
215,Monica,Half the guys out there have makeup on.
216,Ross,What?
217,Monica,"All right, half the people."
218,Monica,"I mean, just try it and see."
219,Ross,No.
220,Ross,I am not putting on makeup.
221,Phoebe,Hello.
222,Phoebe,Oh good.
223,Phoebe,Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me?
224,Phoebe,OH!!
225,Phoebe,Demon!!
226,Phoebe,Demon!
227,Monica,Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
228,Chandler,"Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear."
229,Chandler,You-you know what?
230,Chandler,I'm going to go over to Joey's.
231,Monica,"Wait, we're supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer."
232,Chandler,"Yes, but I feel like I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today."
233,Chandler,You know.
234,Chandler,In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
235,Monica,You know what?
236,Monica,This has been kind of a girlie day.
237,Monica,"You're right, I'm sorry."
238,Chandler,"Nah, Nah, it's okay."
239,Chandler,I feel like I need to be in guy place.
240,Chandler,"You know, do kind of like a man thing."
241,Monica,Yeah.
242,Monica,Go over to Joey's.
243,Monica,Go over to Joey's and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
244,Chandler,You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
245,Monica,"When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear."
246,Monica,I'm sorry.
247,Monica,We do.
248,Monica,We do.
249,Monica,I don't know why I said that.
250,Joey,Hey Chandler.
251,Joey,Come on in.
252,Joey,We're knitting pot holders.
253,Chandler,"No thanks, Josephine."
254,Chandler,"Hey Ross, I was wondering if Oh my God!!"
255,Chandler,Where are all the men??
256,Rachel,"Ohh, hi, Kim."
257,Rachel,"Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday?"
258,Rachel,Well it didn't happen.
259,Rachel,"Okay, two things didn't happen."
260,Rachel,Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room?
261,Rachel,"Well, it turns out that's not true."
262,Rachel,No.
263,Rachel,"Oh no, no, no."
264,Rachel,"Oh God, you think I made out with him."
265,Rachel,I-I don't want your job.
266,Rachel,I-I don't.
267,Rachel,Ohh this is such a mistake.
268,Rachel,I did not make out with him.
269,Rachel,Nobody made out with him.
270,Rachel,I did not use my keycard yesterday.
271,Rachel,I don't even know how to use my keycard.
272,Ross,Mmm-Hmm.
273,Ross,Mmm.
274,Ross,Mm-Hmm.
275,Ross,Hmm-Hmm.
276,Ross,Mmm-Unmm.
277,Ross,Hmm-Hmm-Hmm.
278,Ross,Okay.
279,Ross,"I, uh, am from Long Island."
280,Ross,I-I came to the city for college.
281,Ross,"Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels."
282,Ross,"But, but, let's talk more about you."
283,Ross,Hmm.
284,Joey,So what's really neat.
285,Joey,"If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer."
286,Monica,"Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip."
287,Chandler,"Monica, could you excuse us for a second?"
288,Chandler,I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
289,Monica,Okay.
290,Monica,"Oh but Joey, come over later because I'm going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter."
291,Joey,"Ohh, I love birds."
292,Chandler,What is the matter with you ?!
293,Joey,What?
294,Chandler,You're arranging flowers!
295,Chandler,You got dead flowers!
296,Chandler,"You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers!"
297,Chandler,This is not Joey!
298,Joey,Hey.
299,Joey,"Hey look I am still Joey, okay."
300,Joey,"Flowers they're just, you know, they're nice to look at."
301,Joey,And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist.
302,Joey,Of a famous baby.
303,Chandler,You're turning into a women.
304,Joey,No I'm not.
305,Joey,Why would you say that?
306,Joey,That's just mean.
307,Chandler,Now I've upset you?
308,Chandler,What did I say?
309,Joey,It's not what you said.
310,Joey,"It's the way you said it.Oh My God, I'm a women!!"
311,Rachel,"Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job."
312,Phoebe,But why didn't you just tell her the truth.
313,Rachel,I did but she doesn't think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
314,Phoebe,"Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company?"
315,Phoebe,You know.
316,Phoebe,What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man?
317,Phoebe,"Huh, did she ever think of that?"
318,Rachel,"You were with Kenny today, weren't you?"
319,Phoebe,Just for a second.
320,Rachel,"Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?"
321,Phoebe,"Well, the only thing you can do."
322,Phoebe,Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
323,Rachel,I'm not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren.
324,Rachel,"I mean, I could, but I wouldn't."
325,Phoebe,"Ohh, sleep with Kenny."
326,Rachel,That wouldn't help me.
327,Phoebe,"Ohh, yes it would."
328,Ross,Mmm.
329,Ross,Hmm-Hmm-Hmm.
330,Ross,"Me, neither."
331,Ross,"I've had a really good time too, you know."
332,Ross,"Ohh, I just like the smell."
333,Ross,Mmmm.
334,Ross,Hmm-Hmm.
335,Ross,Mmm-Hmm.
336,Ross,How about all the way.
337,Ross,"Wow, cool poster."
338,Ross,Or should I say groovy poster?
339,Ross,"So, ahh, where were we?"
340,Ross,"Ohh, you can see them, huh?"
341,Ross,"I-I, did that for you."
342,Ross,What's a matter with me?
343,Ross,You've got a black light.
344,Ross,It's 1999!
345,Rachel,"Kim, hi."
346,Rachel,Okay..Okay..
347,Rachel,Look.
348,Rachel,I'm sorry that I lied to you before.
349,Rachel,You were right.
350,Rachel,Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
351,Rachel,"Yeah, he dumped me."
352,Rachel,"He said, ""Rachel, I can't do this."
353,Rachel,"Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women."
354,Rachel,I can't do this.
355,Rachel,"I'm married and I'm sorry."""
356,Rachel,"And then I don't know why but he said, ""and you will never get promoted."
357,Rachel,"Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."""
358,Rachel,Of course it's true and it hurts so bad.
359,Rachel,You and Ralph?
360,Joey,"Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you."
361,Joey,I'm sorry but we've got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here.
362,Joey,"I, uh, I got to be a man!"
363,Joey,Okay.
364,Joey,"The living room has to remain a guy place, okay?"
365,Joey,That's just the way it has to be.
366,Joey,GreatGreatand thanks for being so understanding.
367,Joey,"I mean, I didn't want to make a big deal out of this, you know."
368,Joey,"You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room."
369,Joey,"I mean, if you want to."
370,Joey,"And, uhh, maybe the watering can there."
371,Joey,And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
372,Joey,Okay.
373,Joey,End
0,Phoebe,"I'm fine, thanks."
1,Chandler,"Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?"
2,Monica,No.
3,Monica,I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident.
4,Monica,I'm gonna get some tea.
5,Chandler,Okay.
6,Chandler,Hiya doin' pumpkin?
7,Phoebe,Nope.
8,Monica,"So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?"
9,Monica,Oh my God!
10,Monica,I think that is so great!
11,Monica,When are you gonna ask her?
12,Monica,"I swear, I promise."
13,Monica,I promise.
14,Monica,"Oh my God, I'm so excited!"
15,Monica,{And I just can't hide it!
16,Monica,I'm about to lose control and I think I like it!
17,Monica,"Sorry, just couldn't resist it.}"
18,Monica,"All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers."
19,Monica,Okay?
20,Monica,"Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral"
21,Phoebe,Okay.
22,Phoebe,Bye!
23,Phoebe,"So, what movie should we see?"
24,Monica,Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!
25,Phoebe,What?!
26,Phoebe,Really?
27,Monica,He just told me at the counter.
28,Monica,"He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!"
29,Phoebe,I can't believe this!
30,Chandler,"Right, because it's fast."
31,Chandler,"Because, it's so fast."
32,Chandler,It's fast!
33,Monica,Relax!
34,Monica,It's Phoebe!
35,Monica,Not you!
36,Chandler,Oh!
37,Chandler,"Good for you Pheebs, way to go!"
38,Phoebe,"No, but it is fast."
39,Phoebe,Isn't it?
40,Monica,Ohhhh!
41,Phoebe,"No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!"
42,Chandler,"So, what are you gonna do?"
43,Phoebe,I don't know.
44,Phoebe,I'll just handle itI'll ask you to talk to him!
45,Chandler,Me?!
46,Chandler,Why me?
47,Phoebe,Because you are so afraid of commitment!
48,Phoebe,"You talk to him, make him scared like you!"
49,Phoebe,Make him aman!
50,Chandler,"I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know?"
51,Chandler,Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
52,Monica,That is so sweet!
53,Chandler,"Still terrified, I'll take care of it."
54,Chandler,No problem.
55,Chandler,Opening Credits
56,Joey,"Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?"
57,Ross,"Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island."
58,Joey,Ohhh.
59,Joey,I thought it was like Long Island.
60,Ross,Also an island.
61,Joey,"Hey, what time is it?"
62,Joey,Wow!
63,Joey,"You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?"
64,Ross,Are you serious?
65,Joey,Yeah.
66,Joey,I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
67,Ross,Wow!
68,Ross,We are pretty good at this!
69,Ross,Hey!
70,Ross,We totally forgot about lunch!
71,Joey,"Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!"
72,Joey,"Yeah, my pants are a little loose!"
73,Rachel,"Hey, you guys"
74,Joey,Hey!
75,Rachel,Is Monica here?
76,Rachel,Joey and
77,Ross,No.
78,Rachel,"All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl."
79,Ross,You bought Shawn Cassidy!
80,Rachel,Noo!
81,Rachel,I wish!
82,Rachel,"Okay, you ready?"
83,Rachel,Joey and
84,Ross,Yeah!
85,Rachel,Okay!
86,Rachel,Check it out!
87,Ross,What-what is it?
88,Joey,What the hell is that?!
89,Rachel,"It's a, it's a cat!"
90,Joey,"That, is not a cat!"
91,Joey,{I have to agree with Joey on this one.}
92,Rachel,Yes it is!
93,Ross,Why is it inside out?
94,Rachel,Excuse me!
95,Rachel,"But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!"
96,Ross,How much did you pay for that?
97,Rachel,"Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal."
98,Ross,Yeah?
99,Ross,How much?
100,Rachel,A thousand bucks.
101,Ross,ON A CAT??!!!
102,Joey,It's not a cat!
103,Rachel,All right listen ball boys!
104,Rachel,My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing!
105,Rachel,"I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!"
106,Ross,"Free cats do that too, y'know."
107,Ross,"{Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter."
108,Ross,"Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half."
109,Ross,"If you want a leash, go to the pet shop."
110,Ross,"If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life."
111,Ross,Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
112,Joey,It's not a cat!
113,Rachel,Ugh!
114,Rachel,"Look you guys, I'm really excited about this!"
115,Rachel,Okay?
116,Rachel,I don't care what you think!
117,Rachel,I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson.
118,Rachel,"Well, what am I gonna call her?"
119,Rachel,Fluffy?
120,Ross,"Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth?"
121,Ross,Huh?
122,Joey,"Uhh, the ball thing."
123,Ross,Yeah?
124,Joey,"Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?"
125,Ross,"Uhh, yeah it would!"
126,Ross,Let's do it!
127,Joey,Okay!
128,Joey,Uh-oh.
129,Ross,What?
130,Joey,I have to pee.
131,Joey,And Rachel's in the bathroom!
132,Joey,"Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!"
133,Ross,I know!
134,Ross,"Don't switch hands, okay?"
135,Chandler,Hey ladies!
136,Chandler,What are you in here for?
137,Chandler,"Gary, I'm here to report a crime."
138,Chandler,It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
139,Chandler,"Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk."
140,Chandler,"Man to uh, me."
141,Chandler,"Uh, are you crazy?"
142,Chandler,Are you insane?
143,Chandler,"If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!"
144,Chandler,You mean scared.
145,Chandler,Scared?
146,Chandler,Happy?
147,Chandler,"I am trying to open your eyes, my man!"
148,Chandler,"Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there."
149,Chandler,"You're gonna get home, she's there."
150,Chandler,"You go to bed, she's there."
151,Chandler,"You wake up and oh yes, she's there!"
152,Chandler,"Were you're parents happy, or something?"
153,Chandler,"Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary."
154,Chandler,"Yeah, I think I do!"
155,Chandler,Y'know what?
156,Chandler,You move in with her!
157,Chandler,You move in with her right now!
158,Chandler,Maybe I should in with Monica!
159,Chandler,"Yeah, you're right about that."
160,Ross,now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws!
161,Ross,How did it get there?!
162,Ross,"{Y'know, sometimes I think the script writers throw in a line like that to try to trip me up."
163,Ross,But it won't work.
164,Ross,I'll always have the last laugh!
165,Ross,"<manical_laugh.wav> Okay, so maybe I'm a little deluded, it's probably just my spellchecker."
166,Ross,"But, I must admit I did get Mesozoic and Paleozoic on the first attempt."
167,Ross,Yay me!
168,Ross,Anyhoo}
169,Joey,Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
170,Joey,"{Oh, all right!"
171,Joey,"Geez, I can't have any fun!}"
172,Monica,Hey guys!
173,Joey,Hi!
174,Monica,"Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night."
175,Monica,"It was right here, where is it?"
176,Joey,I don't know.
177,Monica,"All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!"
178,Ross,How do you know?
179,Ross,You don't have a watch.
180,Monica,"Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!"
181,Joey,"Oh, I don't know."
182,Joey,"Yeah, can't do it."
183,Monica,What?
184,Ross,"Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!"
185,Joey,"Yeah, we haven't dropped it in"
186,Ross,"2 hours, 27 minutes."
187,Monica,Really?
188,Monica,"I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good."
189,Monica,Yes!!
190,Monica,Wow!
191,Monica,"Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not."
192,Ross,Hey Rach!
193,Rachel,Hey.
194,Ross,Check it out!
195,Ross,Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
196,Rachel,"Oh, wow!"
197,Rachel,"Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time."
198,Monica,Rach?
199,Rachel,Yeah?
200,Monica,"You have scratches all over you, what happened?"
201,Rachel,"Well, it's my cat."
202,Monica,What?
203,Rachel,"Oh yeah, I got a cat."
204,Monica,I don't want a cat!
205,Joey,"Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat."
206,Ross,Yeah.
207,Rachel,You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat.
208,Rachel,"I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me."
209,Rachel,"And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, ""Rachel!"""
210,Ross,Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
211,Monica,What?!
212,Monica,You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!
213,Rachel,"Well, I was gonna let you play with it."
214,Chandler,Hi!
215,Phoebe,"Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?"
216,Chandler,"Yes I did, and I think you should do it."
217,Phoebe,What?
218,Chandler,"He's a great guy, y'know?"
219,Chandler,"And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady."
220,Phoebe,You are useless!
221,Phoebe,Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do!
222,Phoebe,The one thing!
223,Phoebe,And you can't even do that right!
224,Phoebe,God!
225,Chandler,I'm sorry.
226,Chandler,"If you ask me, I'd move in with him."
227,Phoebe,Ohh!!
228,Phoebe,God!
229,Phoebe,Ooh!
230,Phoebe,"Get out of here, good for nothing."
231,Chandler,Hey Gar!
232,Phoebe,Yeah!
233,Phoebe,Okay.
234,Phoebe,Thanks!
235,Phoebe,Okay.
236,Phoebe,Yeah?
237,Phoebe,Uh-hmm.
238,Phoebe,No that's not true.
239,Phoebe,"If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still."
240,Phoebe,And staying still is good.
241,Phoebe,Watch this.
242,Phoebe,Yeah?
243,Phoebe,That is so sweet.
244,Phoebe,But don't you think it's a little too soon?
245,Phoebe,I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.
246,Phoebe,I justI don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.
247,Phoebe,I really don't want to mess up what we have.
248,Phoebe,I'm justI'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
249,Phoebe,Which is why my answer is yes!
250,Phoebe,Uh-huh!
251,Phoebe,I'm sohappy.
252,Phoebe,Commercial Break
253,Ross,Monica!
254,Ross,Stop throwing it so hard!
255,Ross,We're on the same team!
256,Chandler,Four hours?
257,Chandler,You guys have been doing this for four hours?
258,Joey,That's right baby.
259,Chandler,"All right, let me in."
260,Monica,No-no!
261,Monica,Don't do it!
262,Monica,Don't!
263,Chandler,What?
264,Monica,He's a dropper!
265,Joey,"Oh yeah, that's right!"
266,Chandler,I'm not a dropper!
267,Ross,"It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?"
268,Chandler,It's throwing and catching!
269,Ross,All right.
270,Chandler,Oh!
271,Chandler,Oh!
272,Chandler,That's so hard.
273,Joey,"Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!"
274,Monica,Oh myOh good God!
275,Rachel,"I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!"
276,Ross,"Baking it didn't help, huh?"
277,Monica,"So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?"
278,Rachel,I tried!
279,Rachel,They won't take her back.
280,Chandler,Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
281,Monica,"Rach, why won't they take it back?"
282,Rachel,"Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit."
283,Rachel,"I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?"
284,Monica,"Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it."
285,Rachel,No Mon that's not the point.
286,Rachel,"I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!"
287,Monica,"Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water!"
288,Monica,Don't-don't throw it to me!
289,Monica,My vision's been compromised!!
290,Monica,Oh God!
291,Monica,Okay.
292,Monica,Okay.
293,Monica,It's okay.
294,Monica,"Man, that was close."
295,Chandler,"Yeah, you almost overreacted to something."
296,Chandler,Phoebe and
297,Phoebe,We're moving in together!
298,Phoebe,Isn't it great!
299,Phoebe,Yay!
300,Phoebe,"I know, I'm so excited!"
301,Phoebe,"Well, you're not more excited than I am!"
302,Phoebe,No way!
303,Phoebe,I'm the most excited!
304,Phoebe,"Okay, yeah, I'll see you later!"
305,Phoebe,Don't forget about the moving in!
306,Monica,So you're moving in with him.
307,Monica,What happened?
308,Phoebe,I couldn't tell him no.
309,Phoebe,He got so sad.
310,Phoebe,Maybe it'll be all right.
311,Phoebe,"I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps."
312,Monica,"Why, do you write him a lot?"
313,Phoebe,"No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps."
314,Phoebe,Don't they?
315,Phoebe,"Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out."
316,Phoebe,"No, nothing."
317,Phoebe,Yeah.
318,Phoebe,"No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in."
319,Phoebe,"Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool."
320,Phoebe,Uh-huh!
321,Phoebe,"Yeah, I feel great."
322,Phoebe,'Cause we're moving in together.
323,Phoebe,"Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing."
324,Phoebe,Can I get some water?
325,Phoebe,"Umm, yeah!"
326,Phoebe,Today's.
327,Phoebe,Are these for rent!
328,Phoebe,I thought people were just bragging!
329,Phoebe,Yes.
330,Phoebe,Yes!
331,Phoebe,Fine!
332,Phoebe,I am someone!
333,Phoebe,You want me to say it?
334,Phoebe,I have doubts!
335,Phoebe,I'm sorry!
336,Phoebe,Yeah?
337,Phoebe,That's so sweet.
338,Phoebe,Living with you would make me happy.
339,Phoebe,"No, I really wanna live with you!"
340,Phoebe,I wanna move in with you!
341,Phoebe,Yes.
342,Phoebe,Definitely!
343,Phoebe,Yes!
344,Phoebe,Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!
345,Phoebe,"Oh wait, one sec."
346,Phoebe,One sec.
347,Phoebe,Hey you!
348,Phoebe,Behind the glass!
349,Phoebe,Who are you looking at!
350,Phoebe,"I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms,  which was never!"
351,Rachel,Show cat!
352,Rachel,Quality show cat!
353,Rachel,Show cat!
354,Rachel,Woman No.
355,Rachel,It's not a baby!
356,Rachel,It's a cat!
357,Rachel,Woman No.
358,Rachel,Oh no!
359,Rachel,No!
360,Rachel,It's actuallyit's very sweet.
361,Rachel,It's very sweet.
362,Rachel,Look!
363,Rachel,"Yeah, do you want it?"
364,Rachel,Woman No.
365,Rachel,"Well, so then what are you doing to me?"
366,Rachel,Okay?
367,Rachel,Just get out of here!
368,Rachel,All right?
369,Rachel,Move on!
370,Rachel,Woman No.
371,Rachel,Yes!
372,Rachel,Thank you!
373,Rachel,Exactly!
374,Rachel,You want it?
375,Rachel,Woman No.
376,Rachel,"Oh, terrific!"
377,Rachel,"That'll be $2,000."
378,Rachel,Woman No.
379,Rachel,"Okay, a thousand."
380,Rachel,Woman No.
381,Rachel,"Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat."
382,Rachel,Woman No.
383,Rachel,"Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on."
384,Rachel,Okay?
385,Rachel,So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind!
386,Rachel,Blind!
387,Rachel,"Just take cat, leave the money, and run away!"
388,Rachel,Run away!
389,Rachel,Damnit!
390,Rachel,"Cat, can't you at least smile or something?!"
391,Rachel,"Okay, did anybody just hear that?"
392,Rachel,Anybody?
393,Ross,I'm starving!
394,Monica,Come on guys!
395,Monica,Suck it up!
396,Monica,We're closing in on ten hours!
397,Monica,It's gut-check time!
398,Joey,I don't know who made you the boss?
399,Joey,All right?
400,Joey,We  invented this game!
401,Monica,Please!
402,Monica,I made this game what it is.
403,Chandler,Not fun anymore?
404,Ross,I'm still hungry!
405,Monica,"All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right?"
406,Monica,Are you with me?
407,Ross,I am!
408,Monica,All right!
409,Monica,Let's go!
410,Monica,Let's go Team Monica!
411,Monica,"All right, we can work out the name later."
412,Monica,Rachel!
413,Monica,What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!
414,Rachel,It's not!
415,Rachel,I'm defrosting a chicken.
416,Rachel,"Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson."
417,Ross,"Oh, thank God!"
418,Joey,Did you get your money back?
419,Rachel,"Yeah, 15 hundred dollars."
420,Monica,Wow!
421,Monica,You made a profit!
422,Rachel,"Oh yeah, there you go."
423,Rachel,"Oh good, great!"
424,Rachel,I'll-I'll keep that in mind.
425,Phoebe,I like waking up with you too.
426,Phoebe,Oh!
427,Phoebe,It's such a beautiful morning.
428,Phoebe,"Oh, I can stay here all day."
429,Phoebe,We could have breakfast in bed
430,Phoebe,Okay.
431,Phoebe,Oh!
432,Phoebe,Oh no.
433,Monica,All right!
434,Monica,Come on Monica!
435,Monica,Look alive!
436,Monica,"Come on, look alive!"
437,Phoebe,"Oh good, you're all up."
438,Rachel,Phoebe!
439,Rachel,It's 6 o'clock in the morning!
440,Rachel,Why aren't you at Gary's?
441,Phoebe,"Oh yeah, that's over."
442,Chandler,Come on!
443,Chandler,Gary's such a great guy!
444,Chandler,"Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!"
445,Phoebe,He shot a bird!
446,Chandler,Oh that is over!
447,Rachel,"Phoebe, are you okay?"
448,Phoebe,Yeah.
449,Phoebe,"Yeah, I'll be alright."
450,Joey,"Oh hey, here Pheebs."
451,Phoebe,"Nah, I don't feel like playing."
452,Monica,It's okay.
453,Monica,It's okay.
454,Monica,Just pretend that it didn't happen!
455,Monica,Okay?
456,Monica,No one needs to know!
457,Monica,"I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer!"
458,Monica,"I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!"
459,Rachel,"Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?"
460,Phoebe,Yeah!
461,Monica,Okay!
462,Monica,"Okay, let's race!"
463,Monica,First one there wins!
464,Monica,Ha-ha!
465,Chandler,You guys wanna eat here?
466,Joey,Man that was great!
467,Joey,Huh?
468,Joey,Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
469,Rachel,"Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long."
470,Ross,I know.
471,Ross,My arm is killing me.
472,Rachel,"No, I meant with the dropper over here."
473,Chandler,"Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper?"
474,Chandler,Okay?
475,Chandler,I'm anything but a dropper.
476,Chandler,End
0,Monica,"It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night?"
1,Monica,I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
2,Ross,"Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok?"
3,Ross,But SURPRISE!
4,Chandler,"I missed most of the party  Charlie's a girl, right?"
5,Ross,"Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did    not kiss."
6,Rachel,I don't know why Joey had to kiss her!
7,Rachel,"I mean, of all the girls    at the party, GOD!"
8,Ross,Why do you care so much?
9,Monica,"Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?"
10,Rachel,Be-cause Ross is the father of my child!
11,Rachel,You know...    and I... want him to hook up with lots of women!
12,Rachel,I just... All I'm saying    is...
13,Rachel,I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.
14,Ross,"Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each    other's tonsils..."
15,Phoebe,"Wow, Joey and a professor!"
16,Phoebe,"Can you imagine if they had kids    and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh,    those nerds will get laaaaaid!"
17,Rachel,"All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this?"
18,Rachel,I mean...
19,Ross,"Yeah, it's no big deal."
20,Ross,"I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with    it..."
21,Ross,"Oh, God."
22,Ross,I forgot how hot she was!
23,Joey,Hey!
24,Ross,I'm gonna get some more coffee.
25,Ross,Ok.
26,Chandler,"So, a professor, uh?"
27,Joey,Yeah!
28,Joey,"She is cool, and she's so smart!"
29,Joey,Her mind is totally acrimonious    .
30,Joey,That's not    how she used it...?
31,Ross,Uhm no!
32,Ross,Think less of you!
33,Ross,"No, I don't think less of you."
34,Ross,"I mean,    you saw someone you liked and you kissed them."
35,Ross,"I mean, those people who like    someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people."
36,Ross,"Yeah, I know the type."
37,Joey,"Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious."
38,Joey,No?
39,Joey,Am I getting close?
40,Joey,Opening credits
41,Phoebe,Hey!
42,Monica,Hey!
43,Phoebe,Hey you guys!
44,Phoebe,Look what I just got.
45,Rachel,"Oh, OH!"
46,Rachel,"Wow, I love those!"
47,Rachel,Where did you get them?
48,Phoebe,I bought them off Ebay!
49,Phoebe,They used to belong to the late Shania    Twain.
50,Rachel,"Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!"
51,Phoebe,Oh... then I overpaid.
52,Monica,"Hey, what's this?"
53,Rachel,"Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO."
54,Monica,"Oh, you can't show Phoebe this!"
55,Monica,She hates those corporate massage    chains.
56,Rachel,"Ah, why, now I can't get a massage?"
57,Rachel,There are so many things    that she disapproves of!
58,Rachel,"I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting..."
59,Monica,Do you wanna go hunting?
60,Rachel,"Well, I would like to have the option!"
61,Phoebe,What's up?
62,Phoebe,"Hey, Rachel!"
63,Rachel,Oh!
64,Phoebe,"No, you can't go there!"
65,Phoebe,"You know how I feel about these ""big    massage places""!"
66,Phoebe,They're putting people like me out of business!
67,Monica,"And she wants to go hunting, too!"
68,Rachel,"Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it!"
69,Rachel,It would be like throwing    away a hundred bucks!
70,Phoebe,"Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok?"
71,Phoebe,It's about... it's    about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.
72,Rachel,I don't care about any of that!
73,Phoebe,"Well, do you care about friendship?"
74,Rachel,Oh!
75,Phoebe,"I feel really strongly about this, Rachel."
76,Phoebe,"Please, don't use    this gift certificate."
77,Phoebe,I'm asking you as a friend.
78,Rachel,"Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!!"
79,Rachel,"Fine, I won't use it!"
80,Phoebe,Promise?
81,Rachel,I promise.
82,Phoebe,Thank you.
83,Rachel,But I am going hunting!
84,Monica,Hey honey!
85,Monica,I missed you today!
86,Chandler,"Oh, yeah?"
87,Monica,Yeah.
88,Monica,What d'you wanna do tonight?
89,Chandler,"Oh, well... Maybe we could..."
90,Monica,"Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess?"
91,Monica,Know your audience!
92,Monica,"Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need    to keep your tadpoles in the tank."
93,Chandler,We really need to take those tests?
94,Monica,"Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year."
95,Monica,I think    it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.
96,Chandler,But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
97,Monica,What is the big deal?
98,Chandler,It's weird!
99,Chandler,In a doctor's office?
100,Monica,It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do    it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?
101,Chandler,I cannot believe Ross told you that!
102,Chandler,"And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!"
103,Monica,"Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think    it's a good idea!"
104,Chandler,"Yeah, ok."
105,Chandler,I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than    on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!
106,Monica,OH!
107,Chandler,"Oh, yeah!"
108,Chandler,RACHEL TALKS TOO!
109,Joey,Who says that wine has to cost    more than milk!
110,Joey,Heeey!
111,Joey,"Come on in, how are ya?"
112,Joey,Can I offer you a drink?
113,Joey,Uh-oh.
114,Joey,"I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to    open a door and go  ohhhh!"
115,Joey,"Hey, if you need a tour guide..."
116,Joey,"Yeah, definitely, definitely."
117,Joey,"Ok, what do you wanna see first?"
118,Joey,Ok!
119,Joey,"I know, yeah!"
120,Joey,"Ok, let me stop you right there."
121,Joey,"The Mets suck, ok?"
122,Joey,You wanna    see the Yankees.
123,Joey,"Which one, they all suck!"
124,Joey,I don't think so.
125,Rachel,Hi there!
126,Rachel,"Oh, hi."
127,Rachel,"I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and    here is my gift certificate."
128,Rachel,And... taped back together.
129,Rachel,Ok
130,Rachel,through the glass doors.
131,Rachel,Alright-y then.
132,Phoebe,Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around?
133,Phoebe,"Oh, no, no!"
134,Phoebe,"Listen, is there someone    who can fill in for me?"
135,Phoebe,But that woman can't know I work    here.
136,Phoebe,She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this    massage chains are.
137,Phoebe,'Cause it's good money!
138,Phoebe,But that doesn't change the fact that    this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
139,Phoebe,"Ok, are they listening?"
140,Joey,Ross!
141,Ross,Hi!
142,Joey,I need to talk to you about Charlie.
143,Ross,"Oh, do you, do you really?"
144,Joey,"Yeah, I'm..."
145,Joey,I'm kind of having a little problem.
146,Ross,"Look, if you don't know what the word ""acrimonious""    means, just don't use it!"
147,Joey,"No, look, you know Charlie, right?"
148,Joey,"She's cool, she's funny, her    body is soo..."
149,Ross,Get to the problem!
150,Joey,Yes.
151,Joey,It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've    ever dated!
152,Joey,Combined!
153,Joey,I don't want her to think I'm stupid!
154,Ross,Are you wearing two belts?
155,Joey,"EH, what do you know!"
156,Ross,You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.
157,Joey,"Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural    places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff."
158,Joey,You gotta help me out!
159,Ross,"You know, I really don't want to    get involved in you guy's relationship."
160,Joey,"Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really    like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her."
161,Ross,Fine.
162,Joey,Thanks.
163,Ross,Ok. Let's see.
164,Ross,"Oh, you should take her to the MET!"
165,Joey,The Metsss!
166,Ross,"Oh, no!"
167,Ross,The MET!
168,Ross,The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
169,Joey,"Oh, that's what she meant!"
170,Joey,"You know, if they're    gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE!"
171,Joey,"You know, short for museum,    and avoid all the confusion!"
172,Ross,"Yeah, most of it it's a place  packed with confused angry    baseball fans!"
173,Joey,"Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET."
174,Ross,"Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore    on Madison Avenue."
175,Ross,You know what?
176,Ross,"She loves architecture,    you know what you should do?"
177,Ross,You should take a walk down fifth to the    Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that    she'd love.
178,Joey,"Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!"
179,Ross,But I'm not!
180,Ross,You know what if you're in the mood for    Thai food...
181,Joey,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
182,Joey,"Slow down, you go way too    fast."
183,Joey,Ok?
184,Joey,"Just go back to the MET, ok?"
185,Ross,Ok.
186,Joey,You got to tell me exactly what to do there.
187,Ross,"Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities    wing."
188,Ross,"Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire."
189,Joey,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
190,Joey,"So, I walk in the door and make    the right"
191,Chandler,I have a weird feeling about this place.
192,Chandler,How do I    know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
193,Monica,"Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody    is gonna wanna watch that."
194,Chandler,Deposit my specimen?
195,Chandler,"You know,    usually I have to call a  900 number for that kind    of talk."
196,Chandler,"Thanks, got it."
197,Monica,"Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going    to be ok?"
198,Chandler,"Yeah, I guess!"
199,Monica,"I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares!"
200,Monica,No one here even    knows you!
201,Chandler,"Oh, Come on!"
202,Chandler,Commercial Break
203,Monica,"Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!"
204,Chandler,Why are you here?
205,Chandler,No no no...
206,Chandler,"I mean, why?"
207,Chandler,why is    she here?
208,Chandler,What!
209,Monica,This was fun!
210,Monica,But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!
211,Chandler,"I'd love to stay, but I have eh...  got    a hot date..."
212,Chandler,I think it just fell off.
213,Phoebe,"Hello ""ja"", it's time    for your massage, ja!"
214,Phoebe,Put your face in the hole.
215,Rachel,"Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person."
216,Phoebe,"Okay, then I'm Swedish..."
217,Monica,"So, what's your name?"
218,Phoebe,It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...
219,Rachel,Oh... what an interesting name.
220,Phoebe,Ja!
221,Rachel,You know I...
222,Phoebe,Time for your scalp massage!
223,Rachel,Wow...
224,Rachel,I really love    your...
225,Phoebe,Is something wrong?
226,Rachel,"No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea...     Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?"
227,Phoebe,Uhm... Stockholm.
228,Rachel,Damn!
229,Rachel,I wish I knew if that was right!
230,Joey,Note the painterly    lines and subtle impasto on this canvas.
231,Joey,Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors    as his elusive subject was light itself.
232,Ross,"Now, do you have any idea what you just said?"
233,Joey,(shaking his head as if to
234,Ross,"Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt    M-O-N-A-Y."
235,Ross,I just...
236,Ross,I wrote that out phonetically for you.
237,Joey,Phonetically?
238,Ross,"Yeah, yeah that means... you know?"
239,Ross,We just... we don't have time    for this.
240,Joey,Ok.
241,Ross,"Ok, but you know what?"
242,Ross,"I gotta say,    I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!"
243,Joey,Ah!
244,Joey,I'm an actor!
245,Joey,I can memorize anything!
246,Joey,"Last week on ""Days""    I had to say ""Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy""."
247,Ross,Wow.
248,Ross,What does that mean?
249,Joey,No idea!
250,Joey,"But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I    guess it means ""you're gonna get eaten by a bear""."
251,Ross,Ok!
252,Ross,So let's move on to the Renaissance?
253,Joey,"Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish    of the central figure."
254,Joey,"Touch it, it's really bumpy!"
255,Ross,Nah ah!
256,Ross,Nah ah!
257,Ross,No no no!
258,Ross,"No ad-libbing    and dude, you can't touch the paintings."
259,Joey,Come on!
260,Joey,you...
261,Ross,No!
262,Chandler,My specimen is in the    room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.
263,Chandler,Really helped speed the process along!
264,Chandler,Janice!
265,Chandler,You're not... gone?
266,Chandler,Yeah!
267,Chandler,yeah...
268,Chandler,The hard part is over!
269,Chandler,I haven't...
270,Chandler,I haven't even thought about the results yet...
271,Chandler,I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
272,Chandler,"Yeah, but what if it's not?"
273,Chandler,What if there    is a reason why we can't have a baby?
274,Chandler,"oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks."
275,Chandler,I can't believe    I didn't even think of that.
276,Chandler,I guess I was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... 'that'...
277,Chandler,"It was a ""Wendy's!!    """
278,Phoebe,"""Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! """
279,Phoebe,And that is    the Swedish National Anthem!
280,Phoebe,Thank you for asking!
281,Rachel,"Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture."
282,Rachel,"Uhm, you know what?"
283,Rachel,I have    a friend who is a masseuse.
284,Phoebe,"Oh, Ja!"
285,Phoebe,Ja!
286,Rachel,Yah!
287,Rachel,She's... uhm... not very good though...
288,Phoebe,"Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?"
289,Rachel,I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy    fingers from playing crummy guitar...
290,Phoebe,Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're    such a high maintenance tight ass!
291,Rachel,Phoebe!
292,Phoebe,You know it's me?
293,Rachel,For like a half an hour!
294,Rachel,"Man, you can lie about Sweden!"
295,Phoebe,How can you come here?
296,Rachel,How could you not tell me you worked here?
297,Phoebe,I don't have to tell you everything!
298,Rachel,"Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting    a free massage!"
299,Phoebe,Tips not included.
300,Rachel,Oh!
301,Rachel,"Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?"
302,Phoebe,Because I was ashamed ok?
303,Phoebe,I sold out for the cash!
304,Phoebe,"And then    they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K."
305,Phoebe,But you know...    you pay a price.
306,Phoebe,Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh!
307,Phoebe,paying taxes!
308,Rachel,"Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there    right now and quit!"
309,Rachel,Be true to what you believe in!
310,Rachel,"Honey, you have principles    and I so admire that!"
311,Rachel,I don't have any!
312,Phoebe,You know what?
313,Phoebe,You are right.
314,Phoebe,I am gonna quit.
315,Phoebe,It's time    I took my life back!
316,Rachel,Good for you Pheebs!
317,Phoebe,Ok.
318,Phoebe,"Okay  If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any    of that."
319,Phoebe,I love you.
320,Ross,Haha!
321,Ross,Got ya!
322,Ross,"Die, die, die!"
323,Ross,"Respectfully, professor    R. Geller."
324,Ross,Hey!
325,Ross,"Hey, how was the Met?"
326,Ross,Yeah?
327,Ross,"Joey really knows his art, huh?"
328,Ross,What do you mean?
329,Ross,"Wait a minute... when you guys walked    into the Met, did you go to the right?"
330,Ross,"Oh Joey, Joey!"
331,Ross,"But still, I mean, it seems like    you guys are having a great time together."
332,Ross,What?
333,Ross,"What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on."
334,Ross,Yeah.
335,Ross,But you know what?
336,Ross,I think you should give Joey    a chance.
337,Ross,"I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about    art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else."
338,Ross,"And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all    that stuff is because he thought it was important to you."
339,Ross,"You    know, that's the kind of guy Joey is."
340,Ross,That was going to be my next argument.
341,Joey,Hey!
342,Ross,Hey!
343,Joey,You're ready?
344,Joey,Hey Ross!
345,Joey,"That art stuff worked, you hooked me    up."
346,Ross,Glad I could help man.
347,Joey,"Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna    be, but..."
348,Joey,I made it work.
349,Chandler,It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.
350,Chandler,Hello?
351,Chandler,"Oh hi, Doctor Connelly."
352,Chandler,"No, she's not here    but, you know, I can tell her."
353,Chandler,Should I be sitting down for this?
354,Chandler,Oh.
355,Chandler,"Well, so what does that mean?"
356,Chandler,"Ok. Ok, thank you."
357,Chandler,Thanks.
358,Monica,Hey sweetie.
359,Chandler,Doctor Connelly just called.
360,Monica,With good news?
361,Monica,"Of course    it is not good news, you just said  ""Doctor Connelly just called""."
362,Monica,"If it was good news you would have said  ""Doctor Connelly just    called! """
363,Monica,But so what is it?
364,Monica,"Is there a problem, uh?"
365,Monica,Is there a problem    with me or with you?
366,Chandler,Actually it's both of us.
367,Monica,What?
368,Chandler,Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable    environment.
369,Monica,Oh... what does that mean?
370,Chandler,It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers    and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do.
371,Chandler,It    means...
372,Monica,Chandler?
373,Chandler,"It means that we can keep trying, but there's    a good chance this may never happen for us."
374,Monica,Oh my God!
375,Chandler,I'm sorry.
376,Monica,I'm sorry too.
377,Chandler,"Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out."
378,Monica,I know.
379,Monica,Closing credits
380,Phoebe,Good morning receptionist.
381,Phoebe,Rachel Green?
382,Phoebe,"Son of a bitch, she came back?"
383,Phoebe,Are you ready for    your Scottish massage?
384,Phoebe,"Put your face in the hole, lassy."
385,Phoebe,End
0,Chandler,Hey Eddie.
1,Chandler,Daahh!!
2,Chandler,What're you doin' here?
3,Chandler,Why?
4,Chandler,I can't sleep now.
5,Chandler,"No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now."
6,Chandler,Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.
7,Chandler,I didn't realize that.
8,Chandler,GET OUT NOW!
9,Chandler,Yes please.
10,Chandler,I want you out.
11,Chandler,Where did you hear it from before?
12,Joey,Hey.
13,Monica,Hey.
14,Rachel,Hey.
15,Rachel,"Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh?"
16,Joey,"Seriously, you like it?"
17,Joey,"This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?"
18,Monica,A mirror?
19,Joey,"Fine, make fun."
20,Joey,I think it's jaunty.
21,Monica,"Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood."
22,Joey,"Hey, I'll be alright."
23,Joey,I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one.
24,Joey,I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives.
25,Joey,Heh?
26,Joey,I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.
27,Monica,Cache?
28,Monica,Jaunty?
29,Joey,Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper.
30,Joey,I'm gonna get some coffee.
31,Phoebe,Hey.
32,Monica,Hey.
33,Rachel,Hey.
34,Phoebe,"Oooh, so so so, did you read the book?"
35,Monica,"Oh my God, it was incredible."
36,Phoebe,Didn't it like totally speak to you?
37,Rachel,"Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?"
38,Monica,Rachel you have to read this book.
39,Monica,It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper.
40,Monica,It's about how women need to become more empowered.
41,Phoebe,"Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses."
42,Phoebe,But you know who takes out wind?
43,Phoebe,"Men, they just take it."
44,Rachel,Men just take out wind?
45,Phoebe,"Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers."
46,Rachel,Wow.
47,Phoebe,Yeah.
48,Rachel,"Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit."
49,Monica,It is nothing like the Hobbit.
50,Monica,"It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard."
51,Phoebe,"Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind."
52,Monica,No.
53,Phoebe,"No, 'cause he's yummy."
54,Monica,Yes.
55,Monica,But all the other ones.
56,Phoebe,Oh yes.
57,Phoebe,"Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip."
58,Joey,Anybody want a croan.
59,Phoebe,"Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing."
60,Phoebe,"Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'"
61,Joey,"So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?"
62,Joey,"No, can we get back to me?"
63,Joey,Alright.
64,Joey,Cab driver number two?
65,Joey,But I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
66,Joey,How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
67,Joey,"But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards."
68,Joey,I'm not gonna do this.
69,Joey,I'm sorry.
70,Joey,See ya.
71,Rachel,"Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so."
72,Monica,Isn't it.
73,Rachel,"Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life."
74,Rachel,I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.
75,Phoebe,I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.
76,Ross,Hey you guys.
77,Monica,Hey.
78,Ross,"Uh, sweetie we've gotta go."
79,Rachel,NO!
80,Ross,No?
81,Rachel,"No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?"
82,Ross,Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule.
83,Ross,So you don't miss the beginning.
84,Rachel,"No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind."
85,Monica,You go girl.
86,Monica,I can't pull that off can I?
87,Ross,"Excuse me, your, your, your wind?"
88,Rachel,"Yes, my wind."
89,Rachel,How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?
90,Ross,"You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that."
91,Rachel,"Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now."
92,Rachel,I'm sorry.
93,Phoebe,"Um-um, um-um."
94,Rachel,"You're right, I don't have to apologize."
95,Rachel,Sorry.
96,Rachel,Damnit!
97,Joey,What is it?
98,Ross,"I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it."
99,Ross,"I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it."
100,Joey,"See, this is why I don't date women who read."
101,Joey,Uh-oh.
102,Ross,"What, what's that?"
103,Joey,It's my VISA bill.
104,Joey,Envelope one of two.
105,Joey,That can't be good.
106,Ross,"Open it, open in."
107,Joey,Oh my God.
108,Ross,Woah.
109,Joey,"Look at this, how did I spend so much money?"
110,Ross,"Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due."
111,Joey,Ahh.
112,Ross,"What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?"
113,Joey,My animals.
114,Joey,"Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused."
115,Joey,I don't know what I'm gonna do.
116,Ross,Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.
117,Joey,What?
118,Ross,That audition.
119,Joey,That's a two line part.
120,Ross,"Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite."
121,Joey,So what.
122,Ross,"So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money."
123,Joey,"Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic."
124,Ross,Toilet paper?
125,Joey,Yeah.
126,Ross,"Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic."
127,Joey,"Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend."
128,Ross,I am your friend.
129,Joey,"Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'"
130,Ross,But I don't know it.
131,Ross,What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
132,Joey,"Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe."
133,Ross,"Ok, well then get some sense."
134,Ross,"I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another."
135,Joey,"Look, I don't wanna hear this right now."
136,Ross,"Huh, I'm just saying..."
137,Joey,Well don't just say.
138,Ross,"Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go."
139,Joey,Ok.
140,Ross,Ok.
141,Ross,I'll see ya later.
142,Ross,"Just think about it, ok."
143,Joey,I don't need to think about it.
144,Joey,I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
145,Joey,That was huge.
146,Joey,"Big things are gonna happen, you'll see."
147,Joey,"Ross, you still there?"
148,Chandler,Ahhhh-gaaaahhh.
149,Chandler,Eddie what're you still doin' here?
150,Chandler,"Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?"
151,Chandler,Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm.
152,Chandler,"Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?"
153,Chandler,Look you have to help me out here.
154,Chandler,I thought we had a deal.
155,Chandler,I thought by the time...
156,Chandler,Your last roommate's kidney?
157,Joey,"Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go."
158,Joey,"Ah, it's career stuff."
159,Joey,I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show.
160,Joey,I fell down an elevator shaft.
161,Joey,What?
162,Chandler,Daaahhhh!
163,Monica,Aaahhhhhhh!
164,Monica,Aaahhhh!
165,Chandler,Why must everybody watch me sleep?
166,Chandler,"There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching."
167,Monica,I wa-

170,Chandler,"Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out."
171,Chandler,"You, move out."
172,Chandler,"Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!"
173,Chandler,Uh-huh.
174,Chandler,"This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue."
175,Chandler,You want some help.
176,Joey,All the way to the airport huh?
177,Joey,"You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks."
178,Joey,CASTING
179,Joey,What?
180,Joey,CASTING
181,Joey,"Ohh, you know what it is?"
182,Joey,It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages.

18,Phoebe,"Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?"
19,Chandler,"No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room."
20,Phoebe,Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him.
21,Phoebe,"Let's remedy that, shall we?"
22,Chandler,We don't need to remedy that.
23,Phoebe,"Oh yeah, it'll be fun."

71,Joey,"Uh, well, kinda yeah."
72,Joey,"Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident?"
73,Joey,"Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.'"
74,Joey,"But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'"
75,Phoebe,"Ohh, ok, I see what you did there."
76,Phoebe,"Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?"
77,Joey,Huh?
78,Joey,Never really thought about the writers.
79,Joey,The scripts just kinda come to my house.
80,Joey,But you know what?
81,Joey,"This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?"

84,Joey,DELIVERY
85,Joey,"They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son."

90,Joey,How can they do this to me?
91,Joey,DELIVERY
92,Monica,Well it wasn't that many guys.
93,Monica,"I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage."
94,Rachel,"Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious."
95,Ross,G'night.
96,Monica,"Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with."
97,Monica,Two?
98,Monica,TWO?

100,Monica,"I mean, have you seen you?"
101,Monica,Two it is.
102,Monica,"Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth."
103,Monica,"Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark."
104,Rachel,"Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now."
105,Ross,Tell me about it.
106,Ross,"So what, what's your magic number?"
107,Rachel,Uhhhooo.

113,Ross,"Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini."
114,Rachel,"Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo?"
115,Rachel,"Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him."
116,Ross,Really?
117,Rachel,Oh please.
118,Rachel,That Paolo thing was barely a relationship.
119,Rachel,"All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex."
120,Rachel,"Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head."
121,Chandler,"Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend."
122,Chandler,This is nuts.
123,Chandler,This is crazy.
124,Chandler,"She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story."
125,Chandler,Buddy?
126,Chandler,There was no fish when she dropped it off.
127,Chandler,Hey I didn't kill your fish.
128,Chandler,Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here.
129,Chandler,That can't be smart.
130,Chandler,So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket.
131,Chandler,Tangellon?
132,Monica,Well yeah.
133,Monica,You really ok with it?
134,Monica,"Oh, yay."
135,Monica,Ok about that two.
136,Monica,"Well, it just seems like a really small number."
137,Monica,"And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew?"
138,Monica,Or is that what you're doing with me?
139,Monica,"Oh my God, am I an oat?"
140,Monica,But you've only slept with two people.
141,Monica,Wow.
142,Monica,Oh wow.
143,Monica,"You know I love you too, right."
144,Rachel,"Ross, Ross, please listen to me."
145,Rachel,"Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was."
146,Rachel,"I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh."
147,Ross,"Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes."
148,Rachel,"God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was..."
149,Ross,"Animal sex, animal sex?"
150,Ross,"So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all."
151,Ross,"I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?"
152,Rachel,"Ok, Ross, try to hear me."
153,Rachel,"Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you."
154,Rachel,"Ok, it was good with Paolo."
155,Ross,Knock-knock.
156,Rachel,"But, what you and I have is so much better."
157,Rachel,"Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect."
158,Rachel,"Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had."
159,Ross,Until now.
160,Rachel,"Oh, hi."
161,Monica,Hi.
162,Monica,Richard just told me he loves me.
163,Rachel,"Oh my God, honey that's great."
164,Monica,I know.

169,Rachel,Ooooh yeah.
170,Monica,There's only one.
171,Monica,Hi.
172,Monica,"Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something."
173,Ross,Rachel.
174,Ross,Hey.
175,Ross,"Good, good, good."
176,Ross,"So, is uh, was your moustache, did, used to be different?"
177,Ross,Oh.

179,Ross,Oh.

181,Rachel,"Ok, I, I will do your laundry for one month."
182,Monica,No.
183,Rachel,"Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months."
184,Monica,"Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan."

195,Ross,John Voit was...
196,Rachel,Honey.
197,Ross,"What, what oh...."
198,Monica,It's not gonna happen.
199,Monica,"They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow."
200,Chandler,"So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes."
201,Monica,Why?
202,Chandler,Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.
203,Phoebe,Why would you kill his fish?
204,Chandler,"Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish."
205,Rachel,"Chandler honey, I'm sorry."
206,Rachel,"Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please?"
207,Ross,Yeah.
208,Monica,"Wait, he's not here yet."
209,Rachel,"So, he's on the show, he knows what happens."
210,Ross,Yeah.
211,Monica,Alright.
212,Chandler,"Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way."
213,Rachel,Oh good.
214,Rachel,DR.

220,Ross,Open up.
221,Ross,We want to talk to you.
222,Joey,I don't feel like talkin.
223,Rachel,"Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you."
224,Chandler,We're worried about you.
225,Monica,And some of us really have to pee.
226,Monica,Sorry Joey
227,Joey,Hey.
228,Phoebe,"Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks."
229,Chandler,We came over as soon as we saw.
230,Ross,How could you not tell us?
231,Joey,"I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out."
232,Rachel,"Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back."
233,Joey,"Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me."
234,Joey,Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.
235,Phoebe,"But Joey, you're gonna be fine."
236,Phoebe,"You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera."
237,Joey,"Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me."
238,Phoebe,"Yes, I was going to incorporate that."
239,Phoebe,"Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say."
240,Monica,"Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew."
241,Monica,What?
242,Monica,To me that's nice.
243,Chandler,It's gonna be ok. You know that?
244,Joey,"No, I don't."
245,Joey,"It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be."
246,Joey,But this so was.
247,Joey,"Ya know, it changed everything."
248,Joey,"Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved."
249,Joey,Huh?
250,Joey,I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.
251,Chandler,I'm sorry man.
252,Rachel,"Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us."
253,Joey,"No, that means nothin to me."
254,Chandler,Uhhhaahh.
255,Chandler,Yeah alright.
256,Chandler,"What're these, raisins?"
257,Chandler,"Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?"

43,Rachel,"I don't know, what were the names I just said?"
44,Monica,"Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated."
45,Rachel,"All right, all right, you're right, I won't do anything with Joey, I just thought that we  Ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion?"

53,Ross,There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.
54,Monica,What's so bad about that?
55,Ross,It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
56,Ross,These aren't suede.
57,Ross,Charlie
58,Ross,"Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller."
59,Ross,"Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice."

61,Monica,Is he gonna introduce us?
62,Chandler,"No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now."
63,Ross,"Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute."
64,Monica,Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
65,Ross,"We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover."
66,Ross,I don't think so.
67,Ross,"Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is ""if you can't come on time, then don't come at all""."
68,Ross,An option that many of my students use.
69,Ross,Shall we?
70,Ross,"You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?"
71,Ross,Professor
72,Ross,"Oh, damn it!"
73,Joey,Hey!

81,Joey,Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.
82,Rachel,And you weren't going to tell us?
83,Rachel,How did you think you were gonna get away with that?
84,Joey,I do it every year.
85,Rachel,You do that every year?
86,Joey,I didn't have to tell you that!!
87,Joey,I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!
88,Rachel,"Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us?"
89,Joey,Yeah...
90,Rachel,And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?
91,Joey,Yeah...
92,Rachel,OH!
93,Rachel,"And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?"
94,Joey,I can't believe you guys went for that one!
95,Rachel,"Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?"
96,Joey,"You're fine, ok?"
97,Joey,But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!

132,Phoebe,"Ah, ah."
133,Ross,Ranion's theory of species variegation?
134,Phoebe,"Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!"
135,Monica,"So, did you two have fun?"
136,Ross,"Oh my God, she's great!"
137,Ross,"I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny..."

144,Ross,Really?
145,Ross,Wh-what's wrong?
146,Rachel,I don't know!
147,Rachel,I think it's kind of serious!
148,Rachel,"Oh, you know..."
149,Rachel,I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!
150,Rachel,"... Ok, who is this?"
151,Ross,"I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue."
152,Rachel,"Oh, hi!"
153,Rachel,I would check your hand but...

173,Rachel,Ok professor or detective?
174,Phoebe,Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?
175,Rachel,"Yeah, and he does it every year!"
176,Rachel,That's why he's sending you to that play!

196,Monica,Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
197,Phoebe,Hey!
198,Monica,"Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this?"
199,Monica,I can barely control myself.
200,Phoebe,"Monica, you might want to remember that you are married."
201,Phoebe,Where is Chandler anyway?
202,Monica,Oh my God!
203,Monica,Chandler!
204,Chandler,Where the hell is everybody?
205,Chandler,Bitter

214,Rachel,Matthew
215,Rachel,Ok Monica
216,Monica,Look at you with all the guys!
217,Rachel,Yeah!

219,Rachel,"Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!"
220,Monica,Please... Chandler is the love of my life... ... oooh leather pants!
221,Monica,Have Mercy!
222,Monica,Ross
223,Ross,Ooh... so sad...
224,Ross,"Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard?"
225,Ross,Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?
226,Ross,You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?
227,Ross,... And you called him Alby!?
228,Ross,I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...
229,Ross,"Eh, you think?"
230,Ross,"I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!"
231,Ross,Oh!
232,Ross,like what?!
233,Ross,"Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch ""Access Hollywood""."
234,Ross,Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?
235,Ross,Two?
236,Ross,Wha...?
237,Ross,Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart
238,Ross,Oh my God!
239,Ross,Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?
240,Ross,Oh yeah?
241,Ross,"no, no Nobel Prizes for him?"
242,Ross,Huh... huh... what a loser!
243,Ross,Some more wine?
244,Phoebe,Hey Ross!
245,Rachel,How is it going with Charlie?
246,Ross,Oh Great!
247,Ross,After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh.
248,Ross,average-sized brains out.
249,Phoebe,"Oh, What's the matter?"
250,Ross,She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners.
251,Ross,"Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth."
252,Rachel,I always loved that!
253,Ross,"Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!!"
254,Ross,"Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league!"
255,Ross,oh my God!
256,Phoebe,Worse?
257,Ross,"Oh much, much worse."
258,Ross,"I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians...  ""Can we walk""?"
259,Ross,"Oh, you... you like that?"
260,Phoebe,No.
261,Ross,What?
262,Rachel,Come on!
263,Rachel,I think this is funny!
264,Chandler,"oh yes, God yes!!"
265,Chandler,Bitter
266,Chandler,I...

268,Joey,"Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk."
269,Joey,"Dirk, this is my good friend Ross."
270,Ross,Nice to meet you.
271,Ross,"Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology."
272,Ross,Joey
273,Ross,"Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys."
274,Ross,I'd lead with that.
275,Ross,Monica
276,Joey,Monica!
277,Monica,"Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!"
278,Monica,Joey
279,Ross,Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
280,Joey,"Ah, let me see!"
281,Joey,"Damn, that's a lot of guys!"
282,Joey,Are you a little slutty?
283,Rachel,I think I am.
284,Joey,Let me see if I approve any of these clowns.
285,Joey,This guy wears a rug .
286,Joey,This guy's Canadian .
287,Joey,"And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different."
288,Joey,Joey
289,Rachel,"Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?"
290,Joey,"Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best."
291,Rachel,"Joey, you're so sweet."
292,Joey,That's true.
293,Joey,"But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight."
294,Rachel,Who ?
295,Rachel,Joey
296,Rachel,What?
297,Rachel,Really?
298,Joey,"Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!"
299,Rachel,Oh!
300,Rachel,"Screw it, I didn't get it!"
301,Joey,Gotcha.
302,Rachel,"Oh, Very funny... Joey."
303,Rachel,Chandler
304,Monica,"Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry."
305,Chandler,Well you should be.
306,Chandler,You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
307,Monica,You really liked it?
308,Chandler,Oh yeah!
309,Chandler,"I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained  not to listen!"
310,Chandler,But after chapter
311,Monica,Oh really!
312,Chandler,"Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman!"
313,Chandler,"Tell me, tell me about your first period!"
314,Monica,No!
315,Chandler,Did somebody sign your bra?
316,Monica,So I got it when I was 13...
317,Phoebe,Hey Ross!
318,Phoebe,"So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off?"
319,Phoebe,"What is that, come on, a piece of paper?"
320,Ross,"It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize."
321,Phoebe,Go Charlie!
322,Phoebe,"But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them."
323,Phoebe,"Maybe she's looking to, you know,  slum it with some average Joe Phd."
324,Ross,"Yeah, maybe."
325,Ross,I do have my whole career in front of me.
326,Ross,"I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize."
327,Ross,Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.
328,Phoebe,You're so much more than just brains!
329,Phoebe,"You're sweet, and kind, and funny..."
330,Ross,And sexy.
331,Phoebe,Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
332,Ross,"Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her."
333,Phoebe,Good for you!
334,Phoebe,"And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!"
335,Ross,Stop going through my stuff !
336,Ross,Rachel
337,Monica,Hey!
338,Rachel,I just wanted to let you know I've changed my
339,Monica,"No, you can't!"
340,Monica,Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
341,Rachel,"Please, what about you and Chandler?"
342,Monica,That's different!
343,Monica,I was drunk and stupid!
344,Rachel,Well hello !
345,Monica,What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from?
346,Monica,Why don't you just kiss one of them?
347,Rachel,"I could, I could but I don't want to!"
348,Rachel,I want to kiss Joey!
349,Monica,Alright .
350,Monica,I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.

353,Rachel,No.
354,Rachel,Ross
355,Phoebe,"Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler."
356,Chandler,"Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you."

358,Monica,Bitter
359,Chandler,"Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death ."
0,Monica,"Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it."

159,Rachel,Oh no!
160,Rachel,No!
161,Rachel,God no!
162,Rachel,He should not get back together with her.
163,Rachel,I know that!
164,Rachel,You know that!
165,Rachel,Even Ross knows that!
166,Rachel,But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!
167,Monica,"I'm his sister, okay?"
168,Monica,I love him!
169,Monica,I don't want to see him get hurt!
170,Monica,Come on!
171,Monica,Doesn't that give me the right to control himhelp him?
172,Rachel,I don't think he's the one who needs help.
173,Monica,"No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay?"
174,Monica,I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day.
175,Monica,"Okay, fine!"
176,Monica,"But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in!"
177,Monica,What's he gonna do?
178,Monica,Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?!
179,Monica,"I mean, who would do that?!"
180,Monica,"Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different!"
181,Monica,Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
182,Rachel,Ugh!
183,Monica,"Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him."
184,Rachel,"Okay, you are crazy!"
185,Rachel,"I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset!"
186,Rachel,"I mean, listen!"
187,Rachel,Answering
188,Rachel,Noooooooo!
189,Chandler,"Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right?"
190,Chandler,I mean nothing bad can go down!
191,Ross,What is it?
192,Chandler,"Oh, hurry up."
193,Chandler,I want to sign that.
194,Ross,What?
195,Ross,What?
196,Ross,What?
197,Ross,What is it?
198,Joey,Is everything okay?
199,Chandler,What's going on?
200,Joey,You okay man?
201,Ross,Uh-huh.
202,Ross,Thank Joey!
203,Chandler,"Uh, HELLO!"
204,Joey,Hi.
205,Joey,Commercial Break
206,Monica,"All right, I guess we should go."
207,Rachel,"No, wait."
208,Rachel,Wait.
209,Monica,Oh yeah right!
210,Rachel,"No, Monica!"
211,Rachel,Monica!
212,Rachel,We have to fix this!
213,Monica,There's nothing we can do.
214,Monica,You erased the message!
215,Rachel,Yeah well unless we tell him.
216,Monica,"Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you!"
217,Monica,All right?
218,Monica,"Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him."
219,Monica,I just don't want to be a part of it.
220,Rachel,"Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message."
221,Ross,Hey Ross!
222,Ross,It's you!
223,Ross,I just want you to remember this feeling.
224,Ross,You are lucky to be alive!
225,Ross,So live everyday to the fullest.
226,Ross,"Love yourself, okay?"
227,Ross,Okay.
228,Ross,"Oh, and also get stamps."
229,Ross,Bye!
230,Monica,Wow!
231,Monica,Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
232,Rachel,Right?
233,Phoebe,John Glenn is here?
234,Ross,"Pheebs, we had the most incredible night!"
235,Ross,"Okay, so, we're in the car"
236,Phoebe,Hi!
237,Ross,"Okay, okay, so we're in the car."
238,Ross,Right?
239,Ross,And bang!
240,Ross,A shot was fired.
241,Ross,And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
242,Phoebe,"My God, Joey!"
243,Chandler,It was a car backfire!
244,Ross,"Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!"
245,Joey,"Yeah, I didn't know that."
246,Ross,And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
247,Chandler,Who jumps at loud noises!
248,Ross,Wow!
249,Ross,I could've died tonight.
250,Chandler,Yeah!
251,Chandler,If the car that backfired had run over you!
252,Chandler,"Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life."
253,Ross,I do have a newfound respect for life.
254,Chandler,Oh my God!
255,Phoebe,Yeah!
256,Phoebe,Sure!
257,Phoebe,Yep!
258,Phoebe,"Oh, y'know what?"
259,Phoebe,"If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you."
260,Phoebe,Okay!
261,Phoebe,Bye!
262,Phoebe,Ross and
263,Joey,Bye!
264,Joey,Cut it out Ross!
265,Joey,I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
266,Joey,Dude!
267,Joey,How come you took off?
268,Chandler,"Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room."
269,Chandler,Whatever
270,Joey,Is something wrong?
271,Chandler,No.
272,Chandler,No I'm just tired.
273,Chandler,"Y'know, from-from the walk."
274,Joey,Okay.
275,Chandler,You dove in front of Ross!
276,Chandler,Ross!
277,Joey,That's what this is about!
278,Joey,"Oh my God, you hate Ross!"
279,Chandler,I do not hate Ross!
280,Joey,Of course you do!
281,Joey,I saved him!
282,Joey,You're mad at me!
283,Joey,It all adds up!
284,Joey,You want Ross out of the picture.
285,Chandler,What picture?
286,Joey,"I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!"
287,Chandler,"Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!"
288,Joey,"Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you!"
289,Joey,No!
290,Joey,Iknewyou could take care of yourself.
291,Joey,"Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help."
292,Joey,He's not street like us!
293,Chandler,"When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me."
294,Chandler,That's the bottom line.
295,Joey,"Well, no, not exactly!"
296,Joey,"All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross."
297,Joey,Okay?
298,Joey,My sandwich was next to Ross.
299,Joey,All right?
300,Joey,"I was, I was trying to save my sandwich."
301,Chandler,From a bullet!
302,Joey,I know it doesn't make much sense
303,Chandler,Much sense?
304,Joey,"Look Chandler, it was instinct!"
305,Joey,Okay?
306,Joey,I just went for it!
307,Chandler,"So you risked your life, for a sandwich!"
308,Joey,"I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world!"
309,Chandler,"So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me."
310,Joey,No!
311,Joey,I would never do that!
312,Joey,You-you're like my brother!
313,Chandler,Really?
314,Joey,Yeah!
315,Joey,"In fact, to prove how much you mean to me,  here."
316,Chandler,Thanks.
317,Joey,"No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!"
318,Joey,How good is that?
319,Chandler,"Oh-oi-ho, yeah!"
320,Joey,See?
321,Chandler,Hm-hmm.
322,Joey,"Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?"
323,Chandler,I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
324,Joey,Yeah.
325,Joey,With a bite!
326,Joey,Gee-e-e-eez!
327,Rachel,Hey!
328,Rachel,Hi!
329,Ross,"Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?"
330,Rachel,Hey!
331,Rachel,Y'know what?
332,Rachel,You are in our apartment all the time!
333,Rachel,Okay?
334,Rachel,"This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!"
335,Ross,"Y'know, it-it doesn't matter."
336,Ross,The important thing is that you're here.
337,Ross,"You're my friend, and you're here."
338,Ross,Oh!
339,Rachel,"Okay, just a little scared."
340,Rachel,What's going on Ross?
341,Ross,The most amazing thing happened tonight.
342,Ross,I thought my number was up.
343,Ross,I had an actual near death experience!
344,Rachel,What?!
345,Rachel,What?
346,Rachel,What happened?
347,Ross,"Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?"
348,Rachel,Yeah!
349,Ross,And somebody took a shot at me!
350,Rachel,Really?
351,Ross,"No, a car backfired, but  I thought somebody was taking a shot at me."
352,Ross,"And Rach, II survived!"
353,Ross,And I was filled with this-this great respect for life.
354,Ross,Y'know?
355,Ross,I-I want to experience every moment.
356,Ross,I want to seize every opportunity.
357,Ross,I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
358,Rachel,Because a car backfired?
359,Ross,"Okay, why are you here?"
360,Rachel,"Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole ""seizing"" thing but um, Emily called you today."
361,Ross,You talked to her?
362,Rachel,"No, she left a message."
363,Rachel,But it-it kinda got erased.
364,Rachel,There's just  something wrong with your machine.
365,Ross,"Well, okay, what-what did she say?"
366,Rachel,"Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her."
367,Ross,Wow!
368,Rachel,"Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?"
369,Ross,Huh?
370,Ross,Yeah!
371,Ross,"Yes, of course!"
372,Rachel,Okay.
373,Rachel,Thank you!
374,Rachel,Thank you!
375,Rachel,"BecauseI'm sorry, all right."
376,Rachel,Because y'know what?
377,Rachel,She didn't want menot important.
378,Rachel,"The point is, I was right."
379,Rachel,Your decision.
380,Rachel,Okay?
381,Rachel,I was right.
382,Rachel,Your decision.
383,Ross,Right.
384,Ross,"I guess, I guess I should call Emily."
385,Rachel,"Okay, no, that's not the right decision."
386,Rachel,"That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on!"
387,Rachel,"I mean, that woman made you miserable!"
388,Rachel,"Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?"
389,Ross,"Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience."
390,Ross,"I mean, that-that has got to mean something!"
391,Rachel,"Ugh, Ross!"
392,Rachel,That was not a near death experience!
393,Rachel,That was barely an experience!
394,Ross,You weren't there!
395,Ross,"Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize!"
396,Ross,Y'know?
397,Rachel,"Okay, y'know what?"
398,Rachel,"Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff."
399,Rachel,Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
400,Ross,Huh.
401,Rachel,"I mean, look-look today you escaped   death, y'know?"
402,Rachel,And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?
403,Ross,That does make sense.
404,Ross,"Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her."
405,Rachel,"Well, there you go!"
406,Ross,Yeah.
407,Ross,"Maybe today is just, close call day."
408,Rachel,Close call day.
409,Ross,"Hey, thanks Rach."
410,Rachel,"Ohh, honey no problem."
411,Rachel,Okay.
412,Ross,Oh wait-wait-wait!
413,Ross,The message is blinking.
414,Ross,Maybe you didn't erase it.
415,Rachel,Oh?
416,Ross,"""Hey Ross, it's you!"""
417,Ross,"Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that."
418,Rachel,No.
419,Ross,"Hey umm, was-was Monica here?"
420,Rachel,Yeah.
421,Ross,"Yeah, I want my money back."
422,Rachel,"Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?"
423,Rachel,Ending Credits
424,Ross,"Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?"
425,Phoebe,Yes.
426,Phoebe,Once.
427,Phoebe,"Yeah, a little."
428,Phoebe,He kinda did it to himself.
429,Phoebe,It's not really a good story.
430,Ross,"I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know?"
431,Ross,"And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something."
432,Monica,"Man, I would be great in a war!"
433,Monica,"I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader."
434,Monica,I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
435,Chandler,Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
436,Ross,I know where Joey would be.
437,Ross,He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
438,Chandler,"Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches."
439,Joey,"Yeah, hero sandwiches."
440,Phoebe,Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way.
441,Phoebe,But y'know what?
442,Phoebe,"When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all."
443,Phoebe,Not you Joey.
444,Phoebe,End
0,Monica,"Okay, great!"
1,Monica,Bye.
2,Monica,So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
3,Chandler,Sydney Portier?
4,Chandler,Hehheh.
5,Monica,I miss Rachel.
6,Monica,"No, my parents."
7,Chandler,Oh!
8,Chandler,"That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!"
9,Monica,"Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great!"
10,Monica,", I was thinking we would eat around four."
11,Chandler,Why can't I tell them that we live together?
12,Monica,Because they don't know we're dating.
13,Monica,Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
14,Chandler,Why haven't you told them?
15,Monica,"Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was."
16,Monica,"But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't."
17,Chandler,Why haven't you told them?!
18,Chandler,Wouldn't they be happy?
19,Monica,So!
20,Monica,Dinner in the kitchen around four!
21,Monica,I'll see you then.
22,Chandler,Why wouldn't they be happy?
23,Monica,"Well, um, because mainly, um, they don't like you."
24,Monica,I'm sorry.
25,Chandler,What?
26,Chandler,What?
27,Chandler,Why?
28,Monica,"Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you're really sarcastic, or that, y'know, you joke around all the time."
29,Monica,Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
30,Chandler,Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
31,Monica,"Look, I know that I should've told them."
32,Monica,I know I shouldn't care what they think.
33,Monica,I'm sorry.
34,Chandler,"Y'know, it'll be okay."
35,Chandler,It'll be okay.
36,Chandler,"Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell em."
37,Monica,You really think that'll work?
38,Chandler,"Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn't I?"
39,Monica,I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk!
40,Monica,Opening Credits
41,Chandler,Hey!
42,Chandler,"Oh, good, Ross!"
43,Chandler,"You're parents like me, right?"
44,Ross,"Yes, of course they like you!"
45,Chandler,Well Monica just told me that they don't.
46,Ross,"Yeah, they don't like you."
47,Chandler,Do you know why?
48,Ross,"I dunno, maybe it's because you're really sarcastic."
49,Ross,Or maybe it's cause you uh-
50,Chandler,Well if people don't know they shouldn't just guess!
51,Chandler,"This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for."
52,Joey,"Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin' up, eh?"
53,Chandler,Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
54,Joey,Well maybe I love ya'.
55,Chandler,Janine
56,Chandler,Hey.
57,Ross,"No I don't want to play video games, Joey!"
58,Joey,Yeah!
59,Joey,"Yeah, why?"
60,Joey,What's up?
61,Ross,For real?
62,Joey,"Ye-ye, we go to yours!"
63,Ross,"Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it's my sister."
64,Ross,"But, uh, uh y'know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women."
65,Ross,"Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that."
66,Joey,"How you got three women to marry you, I'll never know."
67,Phoebe,Hey!
68,Rachel,Hey!
69,Rachel,"Hey, Pheebs, check it out."
70,Rachel,"Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English truffle!"
71,Phoebe,"Wow, that sounds great!"
72,Phoebe,"And what are you making Monica, in case Rachel's dessert is... so good that I eat all of it."
73,Phoebe,There's none left for anybody else!
74,Monica,Nothing.
75,Rachel,Nothing?
76,Monica,"No, sweetie, I-I trust you."
77,Rachel,"So, if-if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?"
78,Monica,You're not gonna mess it up.
79,Rachel,"Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me."
80,Rachel,Thank you.
81,Rachel,"Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter's done?"
82,Monica,"Well, it's done about two minutes before it looks like that."
83,Monica,Joey and
84,Ross,Hey!
85,Joey,"Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!"
86,Ross,And the place looks so nice!
87,Joey,"Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!"
88,Ross,Happy Thanksgiving!
89,Ross,The
90,Joey,"Well, this has been great!"
91,Ross,See ya!
92,Monica,Whoa whoa whoa!
93,Monica,Where're you goin'?
94,Ross,"Oh, oh, we did say we'd stop by this little thing Joey's roommate is having."
95,Monica,"Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?"
96,Ross,"Some would say she's attractive, yes."
97,Phoebe,And who else is going to be there?
98,Joey,"Uh, some of her friends, yeah."
99,Rachel,Her dancer friends?
100,Joey,"Yes, all right?"
101,Joey,"All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they're gonna be, be drinkin' and dancin, and we really wanna go!"
102,Ross,"Dude, we were good!"
103,Monica,"You're not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you're gonna eat here!"
104,Phoebe,"Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy."
105,Ross,"Oh, but-but it is, uh, it's just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner."
106,Joey,"Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!"
107,Joey,Mrs.
108,Monica,"Dad , Mom ."
109,Monica,Look!
110,Monica,Look who it is it's Chandler!
111,Monica,Mrs.
112,Chandler,"Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!"
113,Chandler,"Whoa, snowing out there?"
114,Chandler,Mr.
115,Monica,"Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke."
116,Monica,Mr.
117,Phoebe,"Rach, Rach, I just remembered."
118,Phoebe,I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
119,Rachel,Really?
120,Phoebe,"Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong!"
121,Phoebe,And it's making me look at him totally differently.
122,Phoebe,"Y'know, I mean he used to be just, y'know Jack Geller Monica and Ross's dad and now he's he's Jack Geller, dream hunk."""
123,Rachel,I dunno.
124,Rachel,"Y'know to me he'll always be Jack Geller, walks in while you're changing."
125,Monica,"Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!"
126,Chandler,"Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y'know I've always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father."
127,Chandler,Mr.
128,Chandler,He's the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
129,Joey,"Rach, you're killin' us here, will ya serve the dessert already?"
130,Joey,Those drunken dancers are waiting!
131,Rachel,"Look at it, isn't it beautiful?"
132,Ross,"Yeah, yeah, what is it?"
133,Rachel,It's a truffle.
134,Rachel,It's got all of these layers.
135,Rachel,"First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch,  then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions,  then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!"
136,Ross,W-What was the one right before bananas?
137,Rachel,The beef?
138,Rachel,"Yeah, that was weird to me, too."
139,Rachel,"But then, y'know, I thought well, there's mincemeat pie, I mean that's an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y'know."
140,Rachel,Oh!
141,Rachel,"by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?"
142,Joey,Y-sure!
143,Rachel,And while I'm gone don't you boys sneak a taste.
144,Rachel,Joey and
145,Ross,Okay.
146,Ross,Beef in a dessert?!
147,Ross,"I- no no no, there is no way!"
148,Joey,"I know, and only one layer of jam?!"
149,Joey,What is up with that?
150,Ross,"Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!"
151,Joey,Chandler!
152,Ross,"Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd's Pie!"
153,Joey,Oh man!
154,Joey,Now she's gonna start all over!
155,Joey,We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
156,Ross,"No, no, we will."
157,Ross,We just won't tell her she messed up.
158,Joey,Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
159,Ross,"Yeah, it'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!"
160,Joey,Vomiting stories are funny...
161,Rachel,"Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!"
162,Joey,Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
163,Rachel,No!
164,Joey,Still not hot enough!
165,Phoebe,Rachel?
166,Rachel,Yeah?
167,Phoebe,"Okay, look at him."
168,Phoebe,Look at those strong hands.
169,Phoebe,Oh what I wouldn't give to be that can of  condensed milk.
170,Monica,"Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is."
171,Monica,Mrs.
172,Chandler,"Oh, yes."
173,Chandler,Well it's very beautiful.
174,Chandler,"It's cream-colored and tight  I don't mean tight, I mean it's not too tight, not that I was looking at- Mr."
175,Chandler,What?
176,Monica,What?
177,Ross,"Dude, I need to talk to you a sec."
178,Ross,"Okay, I think I might know why my parents don't like you."
179,Chandler,You do?
180,Chandler,Why?
181,Ross,"Okay, remember, we were young."
182,Ross,"Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window."
183,Chandler,What?!
184,Chandler,Why did you do that?
185,Ross,"I don't know, aheh, your's was the first name that-that popped into my head, I'm I'm sorry."
186,Ross,I-I didn't think it would matter.
187,Chandler,How could it not matter?
188,Ross,"How was I supposed to know we'd end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?"
189,Chandler,What about all that friends forever stuff?
190,Ross,"I don't know, I-I was all high."
191,Ross,Commercial Break
192,Monica,Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you  were trying to get Ross stoned!
193,Chandler,Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
194,Monica,"Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!"
195,Chandler,"The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay?"
196,Chandler,So will you fix this?
197,Ross,"Okay, okay, I'll tell em it wasn't Chandler who got high."
198,Ross,Now who should I say it was?
199,Monica,You!
200,Monica,It's not like it's a big deal!
201,Monica,You-you don't still do it or anything!
202,Ross,"Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?"
203,Monica,"Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here!"
204,Monica,"Alright, and if you're gonna put your feet up, why don't you sit on the-"
205,Phoebe,"Monica, leave him alone!"
206,Joey,Will you hurry up?
207,Joey,Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?!
208,Joey,And that they're going to be drinking alot!
209,Rachel,"No, I did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic."
210,Joey,Well you're whippin' so slow!
211,Joey,Can't you do it any faster?
212,Rachel,Joey!
213,Rachel,Come on!
214,Rachel,"I don't wanna make any mistakes, alright?"
215,Rachel,"This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"
216,Rachel,"So why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?"
217,Joey,Oh I am!
218,Monica,"Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will!"
219,Ross,"Okay, fine!"
220,Joey,Ross!
221,Joey,Can I talk to you for a second?
222,Ross,"Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey?"
223,Ross,I have to tell my parents something.
224,Ross,No it can't?
225,Ross,Okay.
226,Joey,"Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert."
227,Ross,What?!
228,Ross,What is with everybody?
229,Ross,"It's Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!"
230,Joey,"Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they're all gonna' make fun of her, do you want that?"
231,Ross,"Okay, okay, we'll just get everyone to act like they like it."
232,Ross,That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!
233,Joey,"Dude, they're not objects."
234,Joey,"Just kiddin,' I'll talk to them, you distract Rach."
235,Ross,"Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?"
236,Rachel,Okay...
237,Rachel,"What's up, Ross?"
238,Ross,So um...Thanksgiving.
239,Ross,"The holiday season is upon us, hm?"
240,Rachel,Yeah!
241,Ross,And um...You look nice today.
242,Rachel,Oh no.
243,Rachel,"No Ross, don't do this."
244,Ross,What?
245,Rachel,I just- I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
246,Ross,Eh?
247,Rachel,I thought this might happen today.
248,Rachel,"Ross, I know the holidays can be rough."
249,Rachel,Y'know?
250,Rachel,And it's probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
251,Ross,You're alone.
252,Rachel,"No, I-I live with Phoebe."
253,Rachel,"I mean you're  alone, alone."
254,Rachel,And I just-it's just not the time for us.
255,Rachel,I'm sorry.
256,Ross,"Ah well, can't blame a guy for trying!"
257,Joey,"Oh and  Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach  or uh, or saying mmm and uh, oh oh!"
258,Joey,"And smiling , okay?"
259,Chandler,"Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore."
260,Joey,"Rachel, there you are!"
261,Joey,"Come on, let's serve that dessert already!"
262,Rachel,"Joey, you're gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what?"
263,Rachel,You don't get any dessert.
264,Joey,Really?
265,Rachel,"No, I'm just kidding I would never do that to you!"
266,Rachel,"Okay, everybody, it's trifle time!"
267,Phoebe,"So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?"
268,Rachel,It sure is.
269,Phoebe,Wow.
270,Phoebe,So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?
271,Rachel,Beef.
272,Phoebe,I can't have any.
273,Phoebe,You know I don't eat meat.
274,Phoebe,Ohhh no.
275,Rachel,"Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste."
276,Monica,Really?
277,Rachel,"Oh oh oh, wait!"
278,Rachel,You only got whipped cream in there!
279,Rachel,Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!
280,Monica,Okay.
281,Rachel,Op!
282,Rachel,"Wait, you dropped a pea."
283,Rachel,Well?
284,Monica,Mmmm!
285,Monica,It's good!
286,Rachel,Really?
287,Rachel,How good?
288,Monica,"It's so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is."
289,Monica,Especially Ross.
290,Chandler,"Yeah, this is so good, that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert."
291,Chandler,Mrs.
292,Monica,"I'm gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it."
293,Rachel,"Okay, now what was that all about?"
294,Rachel,Is it-does it not taste good?
295,Rachel,Let me try it.
296,Ross,Wha?
297,Ross,No no!
298,Ross,Ah!
299,Ross,All gone!
300,Ross,So good!
301,Ross,Maybe Chandler has some left.
302,Ross,It tastes like feet!
303,Joey,I like it.
304,Ross,Are you kidding?
305,Joey,What's not to like?
306,Joey,Custard?
307,Joey,Good.
308,Joey,Jam?
309,Joey,Good.
310,Joey,Meat?
311,Joey,Gooooood.
312,Rachel,"...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?"
313,Chandler,"Yes, but if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it."
314,Phoebe,"Rachel, come here."
315,Phoebe,"Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack."
316,Rachel,"Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?"
317,Phoebe,"I dunno, let's see!"
318,Phoebe,"So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire."
319,Phoebe,"And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl."
320,Rachel,"Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!"
321,Phoebe,"Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me!"
322,Phoebe,It was soo cool!
323,Phoebe,"Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen."
324,Phoebe,Mr.
325,Phoebe,"Five minutes ago, a line like that would've floored me."
326,Phoebe,Now nothing.
327,Phoebe,"Well, not nothing, I am still a woman."
328,Monica,Ross?
329,Monica,Let's go.
330,Ross,"Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter."
331,Monica,"Alright, you know what?"
332,Monica,That's it.
333,Monica,You've had your chance.
334,Ross,Wha-what?
335,Monica,Mom!
336,Monica,Dad!
337,Monica,Ross smoked pot in college!
338,Monica,Mr. and Mrs.
339,Ross,You are such a tattletale!
340,Ross,"Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?"
341,Ross,Mr. and Mrs.
342,Ross,Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me.
343,Ross,I'm sorry.
344,Ross,Mrs.
345,Monica,"And Dad, y'know that mailman that you got fired?"
346,Monica,He didn't steal your Playboys!
347,Monica,Ross did!
348,Ross,"Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing, Monica did!"
349,Monica,Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year!
350,Ross,Monica and Chandler are living together!
351,Monica,Ross married Rachel in Vegas!
352,Monica,And got divorced!

366,Rachel,I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad!
367,Monica,"Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine."
368,Monica,It's still in the bathroom.
369,Joey,"No it isn't, I ate that."
370,Joey,Mrs.

3,Phoebe,Sure.
4,Phoebe,"Yeah, he's kinda sexy."
5,Rachel,"Oh no, no, I'll be there too."
6,Phoebe,"Okay so, we'll just come up with some kind of signal if it's going well you can take off."
7,Rachel,No Phoebe!
8,Rachel,I just need you there for support.
9,Rachel,I haven't told him I'm pregnant yet.
10,Phoebe,Oh.
11,Phoebe,Why not?
12,Rachel,Cause I know he's gonna flip out and I hate it when he's angry.
13,Phoebe,"Oh Rachel, this is all so Papa don't preach.'"
14,Rachel,What Phoebe?
15,Rachel,Wait!
16,Rachel,One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw me doing that again he'd make me eat the entire pack.
17,Phoebe,Wow!
18,Phoebe,"Oh well, I will be there!"
19,Rachel,Thank you.
20,Phoebe,Gosh.
21,Phoebe,I'm not gonna let that man make you eat your baby.
22,Phoebe,Oh.
23,Phoebe,Hey!
24,Phoebe,Who is that guy?
25,Phoebe,I think I know him.
26,Monica,No you don't!
27,Rachel,No you don't.
28,Phoebe,Oh my God!!!
29,Phoebe,Monica!!
30,Phoebe,He's the stripper from your bachelorette party!
31,Chandler,Her what?!
32,Phoebe,Your secret bachelorette party
33,Chandler,You had a bachelorette party?
34,Phoebe,She untied his G-string with her teeth.
35,Phoebe,Somebody stop me!
36,Chandler,I thought we weren't gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties!
37,Chandler,"Y'know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition."
38,Joey,It's a grand tradition!
39,Monica,"I'm sorry, they surprised me."
40,Monica,There was nothing I could do!
41,Rachel,Well you could've untied it with your hands.
42,Joey,This is so unfair!
43,Joey,"The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasn't allowed to."
44,Joey,All I got was a stupid steak dinner!
45,Chandler,You went home with the waitress.
46,Joey,"Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night."
47,Chandler,I can't believe you didn't tell me!
48,Chandler,You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!

58,Rachel,This was such a huge mistake.
59,Rachel,I can't tell him Phoebe.
60,Rachel,"I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't"
61,Phoebe,Rachel!
62,Rachel,"No it's okay, this is what's gonna happen."
63,Rachel,I'm gonna wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him.
64,Phoebe,"Why, so he can get mad at the baby?"
65,Rachel,"Hey, that is thebaby's problem."
66,Rachel,"Oh, everything okay with the waiter?"
67,Rachel,Dr.
68,Rachel,"Well Umm, I got TiVo."
69,Rachel,Dr.

93,Ross,"Okay, I-I'll see you tonight."
94,Ross,"Okay, bye."
95,Chandler,My God!

97,Joey,"So uh, you and Mona, been a while now."
98,Joey,How's it going?
99,Ross,"Ah, it's good."
100,Ross,It's going good.
101,Ross,"I mean, we get along great."
102,Ross,"She's, she's so"
103,Joey,Hot?
104,Ross,"Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!"
105,Chandler,She's okay with Rachel and the baby?
106,Ross,Well II haven't actually told her yet.
107,Ross,"I don't want to scare her off, y'know?"
108,Chandler,"Well, you have to honest with her!"
109,Chandler,"Otherwise you may think that you're going down the same path, but you're really going down different ones."
110,Joey,I'm gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.
111,Monica,Oh my God!
112,Monica,You are gonna love me so much!
113,Monica,"I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight you're gonna have a bachelor party."
114,Chandler,What?
115,Monica,"Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you."
116,Monica,Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?
117,Chandler,Honey!
118,Chandler,That's crazy!
119,Chandler,I don't want you to get me a stripper
120,Joey,Will you let the lady talk?
121,Monica,Come on!
122,Monica,"Come on, it'll be fun!"
123,Monica,It'll make me feel so much better.
124,Chandler,"Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it's a little creepy."
125,Chandler,Y'know?
126,Chandler,I'm not a bachelor anymore.
127,Monica,"So don't think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as aa two month anniversary present."
128,Ross,"Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance!"
129,Monica,Please!
130,Monica,I feel so bad!
131,Monica,Just watch the hot woman get naked!
132,Chandler,All right fine!
133,Chandler,But I'm only doing this for you!
134,Joey,Yeah!
135,Chandler,And Joey.
136,Monica,Thank you.

141,Ross,I'm seeing Mona again tonight.
142,Joey,I'm sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby
143,Phoebe,"I'm sorry I won't be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but I'm really busy that day."
144,Phoebe,"Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah."
145,Rachel,I know.
146,Rachel,I know.
147,Rachel,"I panicked, I panicked."
148,Rachel,I didn't want him to start yelling at me like I was some '74 Latour.
149,Phoebe,It's Lafite.
150,Phoebe,The '74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
151,Rachel,All right here he comes.
152,Rachel,"I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna tell him, I'm gonna be strong."

173,Joey,"So you uh, nervous about getting married?"
174,Chandler,What are you doing?
175,Joey,"Look, look let's pretend it's a real bachelor party."
176,Joey,Okay?
177,Joey,Y'know?
178,Joey,Before your wedding.
179,Joey,"Come on, it'll be fun."
180,Chandler,Okay.
181,Chandler,I can't believe tomorrow's the big day.
182,Joey,How does it feel knowing you're never gonna be with another woman again huh?
183,Joey,Knowing you're gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.
184,Chandler,"You're right, this is more fun."
185,Joey,That's her!
186,Joey,"Okay, come on!"
187,Chandler,Hi.
188,Joey,"Uh, that-that's-that's me!"
189,Chandler,That's me.
190,Joey,"Joey Tribbiani, a big fan."
191,Chandler,"Yeah, yeah right over there."
192,Chandler,That was weird.
193,Joey,Why-why would she go in the bedroom?
194,Chandler,So she's a
195,Joey,"Yeah, that's one naked hooker!"
196,Ross,Uh that's an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.
197,Ross,So much more.
198,Ross,"Aw forget it, it's from Pier One."
199,Ross,Sorry.
200,Ross,Dr.
201,Ross,Y'know this is actually not a great time for me.
202,Ross,Commercial Break
203,Ross,Who did?!
204,Ross,Dr.
205,Ross,Yes.
206,Ross,"Yes, yes I did."
207,Ross,"But-but it was, it was just a one night thing."
208,Ross,It meant nothing.
209,Ross,Dr.
210,Ross,No!
211,Ross,"No sir umm, she means a lot to me."
212,Ross,"I mean, I careI-I love Rachel."
213,Ross,Oh but not that way.
214,Ross,I meanI mean I'm not in love with her.
215,Ross,"I love her like a, like a friend."
216,Ross,Dr.
217,Ross,Hey!
218,Ross,I offered to marry her!
219,Ross,But I didn't want to.
220,Ross,Dr.
221,Ross,I'm sorry.
222,Ross,"Dr. Green, Mona."
223,Ross,"Mona, Dr. Green."
224,Chandler,I can't believe there is a naked hooker in there!
225,Joey,Wait!
226,Joey,Wait!
227,Joey,"Maybe she's a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she's supposed to do."
228,Chandler,Could be.
229,Chandler,"I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it."
230,Chandler,"Ma'am, are you also a stripper?"
231,Joey,Maybe Monica's playing a joke on ya.
232,Joey,Y'know?
233,Joey,"Getting her own husband a hooker, that's pretty funny."
234,Chandler,"That is funny, maybe for my birthday she'll murder someone."
235,Joey,I bet Ross was in on it too.
236,Joey,I mean he was conveniently busy.
237,Chandler,"Oh actually, I'd rather youYeah, go ahead."
238,Chandler,We're gonna have to burn that room down anyway.
239,Ross,"I was going to tell you, but Dr."
240,Ross,Hey!
241,Ross,I did not dump Rachel!
242,Ross,Nor are we still together.
243,Ross,Can I just  Why don't we just let the machine get that?
244,Joey,Hey Ross.
245,Joey,It's Joey.
246,Joey,There's a hooker over here and we thought maybe you'd know something about it.
247,Ross,No!
248,Ross,No!
249,Ross,No!
250,Ross,No!
251,Ross,No!
252,Ross,"I-I-I-II need to, I need to lie down."
253,Monica,Yeah!
254,Monica,Hey!
255,Monica,Thanks for getting me that girl's number.
256,Monica,My husband.
257,Monica,She's a stripper.
258,Monica,"Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?"
259,Monica,Oh my God Stu!
260,Monica,I-I can't believe you did this!
261,Monica,Now are you absolutely sure she's a hooker?
262,Joey,Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
263,Chandler,Why would she do that?
264,Joey,Maybe she wants you to learn something.
265,Joey,Huh?
266,Joey,"Now is there anything you're really bad at y'know, sexually?"
267,Chandler,This is the worst bachelor party ever!
268,Joey,In a minute!
269,Chandler,In a minute?
270,Chandler,What's gonna happen in a minute?
271,Joey,"All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave."
272,Chandler,Why me?
273,Joey,Hey!
274,Joey,It's your bachelor party.
275,Chandler,Which is why you should do it.
276,Joey,I don't want to.
277,Joey,You do it!

283,Chandler,I don't think we've actually done this before!
284,Joey,"No, I-I miss hanging out with you."
285,Chandler,Well wewe still hang out.
286,Joey,Not like we used to.
287,Joey,Remember?
288,Joey,You and me used to be inseparable.
289,Joey,Y'know now it's likethings are different.
290,Chandler,"Well y'know, things are different."
291,Chandler,I'mI'm married now.
292,Joey,"Oh sureAnd hey, don't get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys."
293,Joey,"I justI misshanging outjust-just us, y'know?"
294,Chandler,"Yeah, I miss that too."
295,Chandler,I tell you what; from now on we'll make time to hang out with each other.
296,Joey,You got it.
297,Joey,Come here.
298,Monica,She's a hooker!
299,Monica,She's a hooker!
300,Monica,She's a  Hi!
301,Monica,"Uh, we spoke on the phone."
302,Ross,So your dad dropped by.
303,Ross,He's a pleasant man!
304,Rachel,Oh no
305,Phoebe,I'd better go.
306,Phoebe,Just over
307,Rachel,Ross I'm so sorry.
308,Rachel,Okay.
309,Rachel,"I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail."
310,Ross,I don't care about your dad!
311,Ross,I care about Mona!
312,Ross,She was there and now she's totally freaked out!
313,Rachel,"Oh okay, I'll fix that to."
314,Rachel,What's her e-mail address?
315,Ross,Rachel!
316,Rachel,"All right, I promise."
317,Rachel,I'll fix this.
318,Rachel,I swear.
319,Rachel,I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll talk to her.
320,Ross,Okay!
321,Rachel,Okay.
322,Ross,Thank you!
323,Phoebe,That's it?!
324,Phoebe,You call that a fight?
325,Phoebe,Come on!
326,Phoebe,"""We were on a break!"""
327,Phoebe,"""No we weren't!"""
328,Phoebe,What happened to you two?
329,Ross,Thank you so much for coming back over.
330,Rachel,"I know Mona, just hear me out."
331,Rachel,"First of all, I'm so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own."
332,Rachel,You're gonna have to tell me how you did that.
333,Ross,Focus.
334,Rachel,Okay.
335,Rachel,"UmButOkay, yes Ross and I used to date."
336,Rachel,And yes we are gonna have a baby.
337,Rachel,But we are definitely not getting back together.
338,Rachel,Oh we justwe drove each other crazy!
339,Ross,Yeah.
340,Rachel,"I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go!"
341,Ross,Trying to date this woman.
342,Rachel,Right!
343,Rachel,"But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is."
344,Ross,Probably shouldn't touch me.
345,Rachel,"I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated?"
346,Rachel,I mean we all have our baggage!
347,Rachel,You must too!
348,Rachel,Why else would you still be single?
349,Rachel,I am so gonna leave right now.
350,Ross,Should I leave this open for you too?
351,Ross,Because what's going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you.
352,Ross,"I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel's father."
353,Ross,"Look II made a mistake, but it's only because I really, really like you."
354,Ross,Really!
355,Rachel,Forgot my purse!
356,Rachel,"Oh, you guys made up."
357,Rachel,He's a good kisser isn't he?
358,Rachel,I'm going!
359,Monica,I swear I didn't know she was a hooker!
360,Monica,I mean whDid you let her smoke in here?
361,Chandler,"Her ass print is still on your grandmother's quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?"
362,Monica,Y'know what?
363,Monica,I'm gonna make this up to you.
364,Monica,"I promised you a stripper , and you're gonna get a stripper."
365,Chandler,Monica!
366,Chandler,Wait!
367,Monica,What?
368,Chandler,Carry on.
369,Monica,"Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight."
370,Monica,I think I'll take them off.
371,Chandler,Could you not narrate?
372,Monica,Gotcha sailor.
373,Monica,Closing Credits
374,Phoebe,"Wow, you told your dad the truth."
375,Rachel,About an hour ago.
376,Phoebe,Wanna go see a movie?
377,Rachel,Yes!
378,Rachel,Bye daddy.
379,Rachel,Dr.
380,Joey,Hey!
381,Joey,I do too think about the consequences of my decisions!
382,Joey,What gives you the right to  Go to hell!
383,Joey,Stupid guy on my phone.
384,Joey,End
0,Monica,"So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon."
1,Monica,What?
2,Ross,Question.
3,Ross,Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
4,Monica,You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
5,Ross,Question two.
6,Ross,Why do we always have to have parties with committees?
7,Joey,Really.
8,Joey,Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
9,Ross,Yeah.
10,Phoebe,"Yeah, I agree."
11,Phoebe,"Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are."
12,Monica,Alright.
13,Monica,"If you guys don't want it to be special, fine."
14,Monica,You can throw any kind of party you want.
15,Monica,Joey they're not real.
16,Monica,"I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake."
17,Monica,See  honk honk.
18,Chandler,"Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns."
19,Chandler,OPENING TITLES
20,Ross,"I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come."
21,Monica,"Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper."
22,Joey,"Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper."
23,Phoebe,Why not her?
24,Joey,"Cause she uh, she steals stuff."
25,Chandler,Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
26,Monica,Joey that is horriable.
27,Joey,"Hey I liked her, alright."
28,Joey,"Maybe, maybe too much."
29,Joey,I don't know I guess I just got scared.
30,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, I didn't know."
31,Joey,"I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok."
32,Ross,"Hi honey, how did it go?"
33,Rachel,"Agh, it was the graduation from hell."
34,Chandler,"Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship."
35,Rachel,"Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion."
36,Rachel,"My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would."
37,Rachel,It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.
38,Monica,So what happened?
39,Rachel,My parents happened.
40,Rachel,"All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce."
41,Rachel,"But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address."
42,Rachel,Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them.
43,Rachel,"But you know what, you know what the good news is?"
44,Rachel,I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.
45,Phoebe,"Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents."
46,Monica,"Well, how bout just her mom?"
47,Chandler,Why her mom?
48,Monica,Cause I already invited her.
49,Phoebe,"Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?"
50,Joey,"Oh no, can't invite her."
51,Joey,She also steals.
52,Phoebe,"Ok, here are the birthday candles."
53,Phoebe,Where's the birthday cake?
54,Monica,"Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan."
55,Chandler,Excuse me?
56,Monica,It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.
57,Joey,Oh that's nice.
58,Joey,"Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo."
59,Monica,Dr. Greene.
60,Monica,Oh my God it's Rachel's dad.
61,Monica,What're you doing here?
62,Monica,MR.
63,Monica,"No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok."
64,Monica,So bye-bye.
65,Monica,MR.
66,Monica,"No, no, not a party."
67,Monica,Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows.
68,Monica,"Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey."
69,Monica,MR.
70,Chandler,"This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?"
71,Chandler,MRS.
72,Monica,Chinese menu guy.
73,Monica,Forgot the menus.
74,Chandler,"So, basically just a Chinese guy."
75,Joey,"Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed."
76,Joey,MR.
77,Monica,"Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet."
78,Monica,MRS.
79,Chandler,"Yes because uh, you look so young."
80,Phoebe,"And because you're both, you know, white women."
81,Phoebe,MRS.
82,Chandler,NO!
83,Chandler,"No, I'll take that for ya."
84,Chandler,MRS.
85,Phoebe,"Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha."
86,Phoebe,"I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me."
87,Phoebe,"Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt."
88,Phoebe,"Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon."
89,Monica,"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God."
90,Chandler,"Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?"
91,Joey,"Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-,  oh, ok we can come back out in the living room."
92,Monica,"So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place."
93,Chandler,"Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um."
94,Chandler,Why again?
95,Monica,Because that's where the party is you goon.
96,Monica,See this is just the staging area.
97,Joey,Right this is staging.
98,Chandler,"Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area."
99,Joey,This is clearly in the wrong apartment.
100,Chandler,"Alright you guys are off to party number one  and you, you are off to party number two  Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin."
101,Monica,Chandler could you at least send some women to my party?
102,Monica,Alright that's Ross.
103,Chandler,"Ok, they're coming, shhh."
104,Rachel,"Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner."
105,Ross,Thanks for being born.

130,Chandler,"Well, we could count again."
131,Rachel,I can't believe this is happening.
132,Ross,"You know what, this is ridiculous, ok."
133,Ross,"This is your birthday, this is your party."
134,Ross,"I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares."
135,Rachel,I do.
136,Ross,That's who.
137,Chandler,"Look, are you gonna be ok?"
138,Rachel,"Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes."

152,Rachel,"Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while."
153,Ross,"Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?"
154,Rachel,"Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok."
155,Monica,"Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory."
156,Monica,"Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out."
157,Ross,Hi Dr. Greene.
158,Ross,"So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?"
159,Ross,MR.
160,Ross,I'm sorry.
161,Ross,See that's the good thing about my job.
162,Ross,All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.
163,Monica,"Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on."
164,Monica,You wanna push the caps until you hear them click.
165,Monica,"Gunther, where're you going?"
166,Monica,No.
167,Monica,No you can't go.

202,Ross,MR.
203,Ross,All righty roo.
204,Ross,What a great moment to say that for the first time.
205,Monica,"Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.'"
206,Monica,Very funny.
207,Phoebe,"Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?"
208,Monica,What?

246,Monica,"Ya know, my party is fun."
247,Monica,"I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance..."
248,Rachel,You want me to see a therapist?
249,Rachel,MRS.
250,Rachel,"Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing."

264,Rachel,"Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?"
265,Chandler,"Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed."
266,Rachel,"Ya know, I just, so weird."
267,Rachel,I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.
268,Chandler,Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
269,Rachel,It's just this thing.
270,Rachel,Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks.
271,Rachel,Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big.
272,Rachel,My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong.
273,Rachel,"But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket."
274,Rachel,It never occured to anybody to bring another one.
275,Rachel,And now it's just...
276,Chandler,"I, I know."
277,Monica,"Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun."
278,Monica,MRS.
279,Monica,Ok will do.
280,Monica,So glad you came.

285,Rachel,Ok.
286,Joey,"Ahh, you drive safe."
287,Joey,MRS.

289,Ross,How are you doing?
290,Chandler,"Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?"
291,Chandler,MR.
292,Chandler,"Sorry, we're on a major flan high."
293,Phoebe,"Oh no, you're not supposed to be here."
294,Phoebe,"This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out."
295,Phoebe,Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.
296,Phoebe,MR.
297,Phoebe,"Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway."
298,Joey,Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene.
299,Joey,"Well, ok, you take care."
300,Joey,MRS.
301,Monica,Thank you.
302,Monica,CLOSING CREDITS
303,Monica,"Ok everybody, it's time for flan."
304,Chandler,"Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun."
305,Joey,Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
306,Monica,"Ok, that's enough."
307,Phoebe,"Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish."
308,Rachel,"Ok, I've got one."
309,Rachel,"Wow, those things almost never come true."
310,Rachel,END
0,Joey,Hello.
1,Chandler,"Hey, it's me."

10,Chandler,Aww!
11,Phoebe,"Look everyone, it's the spirit of Thanksgiving!"
12,Rachel,So are things with you and Joey any better?
13,Chandler,They couldn't be worse.
14,Chandler,"I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me."
15,Rachel,"Oh wow, eight hours?"
16,Rachel,So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
17,Ross,Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
18,Rachel,You shouldn't.
19,Phoebe,"Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift."
20,Phoebe,And-and there's the added mystery of who gets who.
21,Ross,Who gets whom.
22,Ross,I don't know why I do that.
23,Rachel,"Well, I'm gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy."
24,Monica,We haven't eaten yet!
25,Rachel,"I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, I just"
26,Chandler,"Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, cause I wanna trade for her."
27,Phoebe,I picked her!
28,Phoebe,Oh thank God you want her!
29,Phoebe,Ooh!
30,Chandler,Wow!
31,Chandler,Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
32,Phoebe,"Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes."
33,Phoebe,"Come on, let's trade!"
34,Chandler,Oh that's not true!
35,Chandler,That's not true!
36,Chandler,I got her that backpack and she loved it!
37,Chandler,"I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it  Oh, there was no big dog."
38,Chandler,All right this sucks!
39,Chandler,"I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G."
40,Chandler,put on it  Her initials
41,Phoebe,Ohh.
42,Monica,"Well, maybe you could give to somebody else."
43,Monica,"Ooh, like Ross Geller."
44,Chandler,"Op, y'know what though, it's kind've a girlie briefcase."
45,Monica,Who cares?
46,Monica,He works in a museum!
47,Chandler,"Hey, what time is it?"
48,Chandler,The big game is about to start!
49,Phoebe,"You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here, you can watch the parade if you want."
50,Chandler,Thanks.
51,Monica,What is wrong with this freezer?!
52,Monica,Ow!
53,Monica,Ow!
54,Phoebe,"God, what happened?"
55,Monica,"Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!"
56,Rachel,People are trying to sleep in here!
57,Chandler,"Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts."
58,Phoebe,"Open it up, let me see."
59,Monica,"Oh, y'know what, I can't, it really kills."
60,Chandler,Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
61,Phoebe,"Ooh, God it looks bad."
62,Rachel,"Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor."
63,Monica,"No, my eye doctor is Richard!"
64,Monica,I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend!
65,Chandler,He's really picky about his patients.
66,Phoebe,"Honey, you've got to go."
67,Phoebe,What's his office number?
68,Monica,Like I remember his office number!
69,Monica,Speed dial 7.
70,Phoebe,Hi!
71,Phoebe,"Yeah, I'm calling on behalf of Monica Geller's eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today."
72,Phoebe,"He's out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?"
73,Monica,Yes!
74,Phoebe,Yes!
75,Phoebe,She's very excited about that.
76,Phoebe,"This is so cool, til Monica gets back, it's like I'm head chef and I get to make all the decisions."
77,Ross,"Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!"
78,Phoebe,"Okay, get out of my kitchen!"
79,Chandler,All right!
80,Chandler,Okay!
81,Chandler,"I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once!"
82,Chandler,"I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it."
83,Phoebe,All right I I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
84,Ross,"So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch."
85,Chandler,"Oh y'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you."
86,Ross,Really?!
87,Ross,Wow!
88,Ross,"That's-that's so nice, what are you gonna get me?"
89,Chandler,"I don't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office."
90,Ross,"Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me."
91,Chandler,"Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets."
92,Ross,"Oh, that's not true!"
93,Ross,I've got her lots of stuff she never took back.
94,Chandler,Like?
95,Ross,"Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year."
96,Chandler,When was the last time you saw her wear it?
97,Ross,"Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh"
98,Chandler,Big dog?
99,Ross,Hey!
100,Joey,Hey!
101,Ross,What are you doing?
102,Joey,I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
103,Ross,Everything?
104,Ross,Even the TV?
105,Joey,No!
106,Joey,I'm putting that in my room.
107,Ross,"Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?"
108,Joey,"Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?"
109,Ross,That's a good point.
110,Ross,"So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?"
111,Joey,Five years.
112,Ross,You've sentenced him?
113,Joey,Hey!
114,Joey,Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
115,Ross,"Joey, the guy's your best friend."
116,Joey,"No, was my best friend."
117,Joey,"Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard."
118,Joey,"With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open."
119,Ross,"Oh, who?"
120,Ross,Me?
121,Joey,Yeah!
122,Ross,Wow!
123,Ross,I'm honored!
124,Ross,And y'know what I'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
125,Joey,What?
126,Ross,I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
127,Joey,All right.
128,Joey,But if you weren't my best friend.
129,Chandler,"I walk into a room and he won't even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian."
130,Chandler,And I know he only knows the bad words.
131,Joey,"Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?"
132,Chandler,Hey Joe.
133,Monica,Oh my God!
134,Monica,How cute is the on-call doctor?
135,Rachel,"Ooh, so cute, that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye."
136,Monica,"Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke."
137,Monica,Dr. Burke is out of town.
138,Monica,The-the on-call doctor will see me now.
139,Chandler,Hey!
140,Chandler,I'm sorry!
141,Chandler,That where are you going?
142,Joey,My folks.
143,Chandler,"Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?"
144,Joey,I don't know.
145,Joey,I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
146,Chandler,What?
147,Joey,"Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I"
148,Chandler,"Hey, look, what do you want me to say?"
149,Chandler,Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
150,Joey,"Look, it's not about her."
151,Joey,Okay?
152,Joey,But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did.
153,Joey,And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend.
154,Joey,"So, I'll see ya."
155,Chandler,"Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!"
156,Joey,Yeah!
157,Joey,You did!
158,Joey,And that's why I'm leaving.
159,Chandler,"All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them!"
160,Chandler,"Okay, they have had a very difficult year!"
161,Chandler,What with the robbery and all!
162,Joey,"When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time?"
163,Joey,I was thinking about how I let you down!
164,Chandler,What?
165,Joey,Yeah!
166,Joey,"But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much!"
167,Joey,See you around!
168,Chandler,"All right, wait!"
169,Chandler,Come on!
170,Chandler,Just wait one second!
171,Chandler,There has to be something that I can do!
172,Chandler,Something!
173,Chandler,If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down.
174,Chandler,What?
175,Joey,We've got a box.
176,Joey,Commercial Break
177,Monica,I was probably waiting for it to open.
178,Monica,You look great too.
179,Monica,So how does it look?
180,Monica,Like a pirate?
181,Monica,"Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad?"
182,Monica,"Come on, one of us had to mention him."
183,Monica,Oh.
184,Monica,Big family dinner tonight?
185,Monica,No way!
186,Monica,Oh.
187,Monica,Oh.
188,Monica,Oh.
189,Monica,So you made her walk the plank?
190,Monica,"Aye, matie?"
191,Monica,I know.
192,Ross,He's coming here for Thanksgiving!
193,Rachel,"I know, it's sick."
194,Monica,Why is it sick?
195,Rachel,Because it's Richard's son!
196,Rachel,It's like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
197,Monica,"Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don't you?"
198,Phoebe,"Yeah, I can see where I'd be your best shot but, no."
199,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted."
200,Ross,Yeah.
201,Joey,What's twisted?
202,Monica,Me going out with Richard's son.
203,Joey,Ewwwww!!
204,Joey,Ew!
205,Joey,Ew!
206,Joey,Ew!
207,Chandler,Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
208,Rachel,Is he okay in there?
209,Joey,He's fine!
210,Ross,"Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather."
211,Monica,Fine!
212,Monica,"Judge all you want to but,  married a lesbian,  left a man at the altar,  fell in love with a gay ice dancer,  threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire,  livin' in a box!"
213,Rachel,"So now, what exactly is the point of the box?"
214,Joey,Chandler?
215,Chandler,The meaning of the box is three fold.
216,Chandler,"One , it gives me the time to think about what I did."
217,Chandler,"Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey."
218,Chandler,"And three , it hurts!"
219,Ross,Oh hey!
220,Ross,"Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year?"
221,Ross,Can I see it?
222,Rachel,Why?
223,Ross,I just wanna check something.
224,Rachel,Okay.
225,Ross,"Now, we'll see."
226,Chandler,Air hole!
227,Chandler,Air hole!
228,Rachel,Here it is!
229,Rachel,I love it.
230,Rachel,I wear it all the time.
231,Ross,"The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver."
232,Rachel,"Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed."
233,Ross,Oh my God!
234,Ross,You actually exchanged it!
235,Rachel,Well isn't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?
236,Ross,What did you get?
237,Rachel,Credit.
238,Monica,I'll get it!
239,Monica,I'll get it!
240,Monica,I'll get it!
241,Monica,I'll get it!
242,Monica,I'll get it!
243,Monica,I'll get it!
244,Monica,I'll get it!
245,Monica,I'll get it!
246,Monica,I'll get it!
247,Monica,I'll get it!
248,Monica,I'll get it!
249,Monica,I'll get it!
250,Monica,I'll get it!
251,Monica,I'll get it!
252,Monica,"Hi, Tim."
253,Monica,Thank you.
254,Monica,Come meet my friends.
255,Monica,"This is uh, Phoebe."
256,Monica,And Joey.
257,Joey,Hey!
258,Monica,"My brother, Ross."
259,Ross,Hey.
260,Monica,And Rachel.
261,Monica,And that's Chandler.
262,Chandler,How do ya do.
263,Monica,"Umm, well, he's"
264,Joey,He's doin' some thinkin'!
265,Chandler,What happened?
266,Chandler,What happened?
267,Joey,You kissed my girlfriend!
268,Rachel,"Ooh, I like those sunglasses."
269,Ross,"Like em, like em?"
270,Ross,"Or, I'd like to get store credit for that amount like em?"
271,Monica,"All right everybody, this turkey is ready!"
272,Monica,"Here, let me show you."
273,Monica,"Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap."
274,Rachel,Fancy soap?
275,Rachel,I thought we were savin' that for the Pope!
276,Monica,See he's nice.
277,Monica,Right?
278,Phoebe,"Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, ""That's not how your dad used to do it."""
279,Monica,I saved you a seat.
280,Rachel,Sick-sick-sick-sick.
281,Phoebe,"Oh, I'll get it."
282,Chandler,Gotcha!
283,Joey,That doesn't sound like thinking to me!
284,Chandler,Sorry!
285,Joey,Y'know I don't think you should be talking at all in there!
286,Joey,I think you've got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
287,Chandler,"Okay, okay, you got it!"
288,Rachel,"Ross, can you pass me the yams?"
289,Ross,Sure!
290,Ross,"Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them."
291,Rachel,Would you stop?!
292,Rachel,What is the matter with you?
293,Monica,"Oh-ho-ho, we've got company."
294,Ross,There's nothing the matter with me.
295,Ross,"See, I'm not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings."
296,Rachel,"Okay, fine."
297,Chandler,"You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!"
298,Joey,"All right, look!"
299,Joey,"If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?!"
300,Joey,This means something to me!
301,Joey,"And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box!"
302,Chandler,"You're right, and I'm sorry!"
303,Chandler,This means a lot to me!
304,Chandler,I want you to be my friend again!
305,Chandler,"I swear, I won't say another word tonight."
306,Joey,So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
307,Chandler,Absolutely!
308,Joey,That sounds like another word to me!
309,Joey,Are you gonna take this seriously?
310,Joey,Okay.
311,Rachel,Don't say that I have no sentiment!
312,Rachel,This is a movie stub from our first date!
313,Rachel,This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed!
314,Rachel,This is from the museum from the first time we were together.
315,Rachel,"Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!"
316,Ross,"I don't know what to say, I'm sorry."
317,Ross,"Though, you're not supposed to take these."
318,Ross,"It's like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that."
319,Monica,"Ooh, this always happens."
320,Monica,Thank you.
321,Monica,Y'know all my friends think this is weird.
322,Monica,I know!
323,Monica,"I mean it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing."
324,Monica,We're just two people who find each other very attractive.
325,Monica,Right?
326,Monica,Nothing.
327,Monica,Nothing.
328,Monica,"No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss"
329,Monica,Don't say it!
330,Monica,Yeah!
331,Monica,I know!
332,Joey,I'll get it.
333,Joey,Hey.
334,Joey,That's okay.
335,Joey,Chandler's the one I'm mad at.
336,Joey,In the box.
337,Phoebe,"Oh, he-he can't talk right now."
338,Phoebe,He's just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
339,Rachel,"Joey, had reasons."
340,Phoebe,They were threefold.
341,Joey,Open the box!
342,Rachel,What?
343,Joey,He can still catch her!
344,Joey,"Come on, get out of there!"
345,Joey,Get out of there!
346,Chandler,So?
347,Joey,"Yeah, we're gonna be fine!"
348,Joey,Get out!
349,Chandler,Yeah?
350,Joey,"Yeah, you did some real good thinkin' in there."
351,Chandler,"Man, this is"
352,Joey,Now go!
353,Joey,Cause you can still catch her!
354,Joey,And Merry Christmas from you're secret Santa!
355,Joey,"All right, who got Chandler?"
356,Joey,"Cause I uh, need to trade."
357,Joey,Closing Credits
358,Rachel,"Oh, he sees her!"
359,Monica,"Oh, he's catching up to her!"
360,Phoebe,"Oh, she sees him!"
361,Phoebe,"Oh, they're hugging!"
362,Ross,He's taking her purse!
363,Joey,"Uhh, that's not them."
364,Joey,I'm gonna go call the police.
365,Phoebe,"Oh, there they are!"
366,Phoebe,"All right, get a room."
367,Phoebe,End
0,Monica,Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married?
1,Monica,Four weeks baby!!
2,Monica,Four weeks!!
3,Chandler,Do you realize you get louder each week?
4,Monica,There's still so much to do.
5,Monica,Have you written your vows yet?
6,Chandler,I figured I'd buy those.
7,Chandler,"Pat, I'd like to buy a vow."
8,Monica,"Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding."
9,Chandler,Right.
10,Chandler,"So uh, have you written yours yet?"
11,Monica,No!
12,Monica,But I know exactly what I'm going to say.
13,Chandler,Do you happen to know what I'm going to say?
14,Monica,Let's just do it right now.
15,Monica,Okay?
16,Monica,It won't be hard.
17,Monica,Just say what's in your heart.
18,Chandler,Look at her go!
19,Chandler,She must love me more than I love her!
20,Chandler,What's wrong with me?
21,Chandler,"Ooh, don't open that door."
22,Chandler,Opening Credits
23,Chandler,"Monica, there are no words  There are no words!"
24,Chandler,This should not be this hard!
25,Joey,"All right, uh  Oh hey, you've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?"
26,Ross,"Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die."
27,Ross,She made no such promise.
28,Chandler,I'm so pathetic!
29,Chandler,Monica knows what she wants to say!
30,Chandler,You should've seen her.
31,Chandler,"Writing, writing, writing!"
32,Rachel,Monica what?
33,Phoebe,What?
34,Rachel,What is the emergency?
35,Monica,You have to help me!
36,Monica,I'm supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this!
37,Rachel,"Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress."
38,Monica,Thank you.
39,Phoebe,"Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small."
40,Monica,Those are my eyes!
41,Monica,Those are my breasts.
42,Phoebe,Oh!
43,Phoebe,Yeah!
44,Ross,"Well, why don't you just start with something simple."
45,Ross,"Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you."
46,Chandler,"Yeah, I'm not sure I can do that."
47,Ross,"...everyone, this is Chandler!"
48,Ross,Fat
49,Monica,"Hi, I'm Ross's little sister."
50,Chandler,Okay.
51,Rachel,Okay.
52,Rachel,Okay.
53,Rachel,Okay.
54,Rachel,"Umm, maybe you can start with, ""Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."""
55,Chandler,"All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth."
56,Chandler,Would you go out with me?
57,Monica,Ennnh.
58,Monica,"Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?"
59,Phoebe,Well maybe you don't talk about your feelings back then.
60,Phoebe,Maybe you just say something about y'know all the things that he's taught you.
61,Phoebe,Like  Or all the things you taught him.
62,Monica,Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones.
63,Monica,"You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!"
64,Chandler,There are seven?!
65,Chandler,That's one?
66,Monica,It's kind of an important one!
67,Chandler,"Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down."
68,Rachel,"Well, y'know, sometimes that helps."
69,Monica,All right.
70,Monica,"Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4,  2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 7..77-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7!"
71,Joey,"Oh, I got it!"
72,Joey,"How about saying something like, ""Monica"
73,Chandler,Monica
74,Joey,"""when I look back over our time together"""
75,Chandler,Yeah?
76,Joey,"Well, I can't do everything!"
77,Joey,Look back over your time together.
78,Phoebe,"Oh, look, twins."
79,Phoebe,"Hi, guys."
80,Phoebe,"Oh, cute, cute."
81,Monica,No fair.
82,Monica,I don't even have one.
83,Monica,How come they get two?
84,Chandler,You'll get one.
85,Monica,Oh yeah?
86,Monica,When?
87,Chandler,All right.
88,Chandler,I'll tell you what.
89,Chandler,"When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?"
90,Monica,Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
91,Chandler,"Oh, no, no."
92,Chandler,I just meant hypothetically.
93,Monica,"Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?"
94,Chandler,"No, no, no."
95,Monica,What is it?
96,Monica,Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
97,Chandler,"Uh, uh."
98,Monica,Well?
99,Chandler,Dear God!
100,Chandler,This parachute is a knapsack!
101,Ross,I'm getting married today!!
102,Ross,"Ahh, whoo-hoo!"
103,Monica,Do you think he knew I was here?
104,Chandler,Nice try.
105,Monica,"Wait, wait, wait!"
106,Chandler,"Look, Monica"
107,Monica,Look!
108,Chandler,This is not going to work.
109,Monica,I bet this will work!
110,Chandler,You are so great!
111,Chandler,I love you!
112,Monica,What?
113,Chandler,Nothing!
114,Chandler,"I said, I said ""You're so great"" and then I just, I just stopped talking!"
115,Monica,You said you loved me!
116,Monica,I can't believe this!
117,Chandler,No I didn't!
118,Monica,"Yes, you did!"
119,Chandler,No I didn't!
120,Monica,You love me!
121,Chandler,No I don't!
122,Chandler,Stop it!
123,Chandler,Stop it!
124,Chandler,Stop it!
125,Chandler,Stop it!
126,Chandler,"Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?"
127,Monica,Then all your stuff would be here.
128,Chandler,"Well, what if all my stuff was here?"
129,Monica,"Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense."
130,Chandler,Okay.
131,Chandler,What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
132,Monica,You wanted it to be a surprise.
133,Chandler,Oh my God.
134,Monica,Chandler In all my life I never thought I would be so lucky.
135,Monica,As tofall in love with my bestmy best There's a reason why girls don't do this!
136,Chandler,Okay!
137,Chandler,Okay!
138,Chandler,Okay!
139,Chandler,I'll do it!
140,Chandler,"Oh God, I thought  Wait a minute, I-I can do this."
141,Chandler,I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it.
142,Chandler,"Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you,  you make me happier than I ever thought I could be."
143,Chandler,"And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way."
144,Chandler,"Monica, will you marry me?"

157,Ross,"Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions."
158,Joey,"How is ""Monica, I love your sweet ass,"" inappropriate?"
159,Ross,How's Monica coming along with her vows?
160,Phoebe,"Well let's just say its she's lucky she has a sweet ass, cause she's not so good at the writing."
161,Ross,I can't believe in four weeks they're gonna be married!
162,Phoebe,Well let's just hope it works.
163,Phoebe,Y'know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?
164,Ross,Phoebe that's not true.
165,Phoebe,"Yeah, you're right."
166,Phoebe,How's the Mrs.?
167,Rachel,I can't believe they've been together for three years.
168,Joey,Has it been that long?
169,Ross,"Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long."
170,Joey,"Hey, it's me!"
171,Joey,I'm comin' in!
172,Chandler,"I've had a very long, hard day."
173,Joey,"Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken."

176,Chandler,"No chicken, bye-bye then."
177,Joey,Okay.
178,Chandler,Are you okay?
179,Chandler,"I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave."
180,Chandler,He kept asking me about chicken.
181,Monica,Chicken?
182,Monica,I could eat some chicken.
183,Chandler,Hey Joe!
184,Chandler,"Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a CokeDiet Coke."
185,Rachel,I don't know why they didn't just tell us.

191,Monica,No one knows!
192,Joey,How?!
193,Joey,When?
194,Chandler,It happened in London.
195,Joey,IN LONDON!!
196,Chandler,The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
197,Joey,But it is a big deal!!
198,Joey,I have to tell someone!
199,Chandler,No-no-no-no-no!

257,Joey,"Yes, but y'know what?"
258,Joey,It doesn't matter who knows what.
259,Joey,"Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know!"
260,Joey,Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
261,Phoebe,"Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own"
262,Rachel,"All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie."

168,Chandler,"Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?"
169,Joey,"Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?"
170,Chandler,"OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank."
171,Chandler,But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that.
172,Chandler,"Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my."
173,Chandler,wrist.
174,Chandler,"But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there."
175,Joey,You know what the.
176,Chandler,"I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times."

198,Chandler,"Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay."

214,Joey,"Wow, is this friendship?"
215,Joey,I think so.
216,Joey,"Check it out, we're bracelet buddies."
217,Chandler,That's what they'll call us.

231,Joey,Oh my God!
232,Joey,I cannot believe you guys are talking about this!
233,Joey,The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!!
234,Joey,All right?!!
235,Joey,Now Chandler is doing the best he can!

239,Chandler,What?
240,Joey,You guys kissed!
241,Joey,Oh mythis is huge!
242,Rachel,No!
243,Ross,Oh no!
244,Rachel,"No-no, it's really not huge."
245,Ross,And; people thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.
246,Ross,Which we are not!
247,Monica,"Well, we're still talking about it, aren't we?"
248,Phoebe,"Well yeah, that and Chandler's problem."
249,Joey,"Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel."
250,Monica,Yes that would be lovely.

267,Monica,Y'know what?
268,Monica,"I-I think that umm, I don't feel like going to The Plaza."
269,Phoebe,Why?
270,Rachel,"Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous!"
271,Rachel,Look

277,Phoebe,"Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding."
278,Joey,Yeah!
279,Joey,"Well, I think we'll see if they actually let you play."
280,Joey,Huh?
281,Joey,"I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, ""You look 19,"" and then they just take it away like-like, ""No you don't."""
282,Phoebe,"Well, I don't think Monica is gonna take this away."
283,Joey,Wouldn't she?
284,Phoebe,Would she?
285,Joey,Would she?
286,Joey,You ate my candy bar!
287,Ross,Guess who?
288,Rachel,Hey.
289,Ross,"Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air"
290,Rachel,"What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn't want to talk, especially with me?"
291,Rachel,"I mean, why not especially you and me?"
292,Rachel,We were both out there kissing.
293,Ross,Still thinking about it huh?
294,Rachel,Come on!
295,Rachel,"Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that?"
296,Rachel,Especially you!
297,Ross,"Oh, who cares?"
298,Rachel,I care!
299,Ross,And so do I.
300,Rachel,"Y'know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?"
301,Ross,Okay.
302,Ross,Sure.
303,Rachel,Am I going to let you watch me undress?
304,Ross,No!
305,Monica,"I can't believe her, y'know it's justit's so typical."
306,Chandler,"Now Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget."
307,Chandler,"There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there's going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris."
308,Monica,Paris?
309,Chandler,We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
310,Monica,Keep talking.
311,Chandler,Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love.
312,Chandler,"Not just because it's romantic, but because I can!"
313,Monica,I love you!
314,Monica,"Bonjour, monsieur."
315,Chandler,"Okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away."
316,Chandler,"It's Paris, who knows we're here!"
317,Monica,"Hi Pheebs, what's up?"
318,Phoebe,"Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I'm just gonna need a small deposit."
319,Monica,What?
320,Phoebe,"Y'know, just some good faith money to hold the date."
321,Chandler,"Pheebs, we're not giving you a deposit for our wedding!"
322,Phoebe,"Oh, I see."
323,Phoebe,"[Cut to the living room, Joey is eating a sandwich.)"
324,Joey,"They break your heart, don't they?"
325,Phoebe,"Y'know, I don't really their permission."
326,Joey,Yeah!
327,Joey,"If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!"
328,Phoebe,Yeah!
329,Phoebe,"And if you wanna look 19, then you You gotta do something about your eyes."
330,Joey,What?!
331,Joey,What's wrong with my eyes.
332,Phoebe,They give you away!
333,Phoebe,There's just-there's just too much wisdom in there.
334,Phoebe,Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
335,Joey,And that'll get rid of my wisdom?
336,Phoebe,Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
337,Chandler,"Oh, give her the deposit!"
338,Chandler,Give her the ring!
339,Chandler,I don't care!
340,Monica,Yes.
341,Rachel,"Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?"
342,Chandler,What a great apology!
343,Chandler,And you accept!
344,Chandler,"Okay, bye-bye!"
345,Rachel,"No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?"
346,Monica,"Well, let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder."
347,Rachel,What?
348,Ross,"Hey, here's a thought."
349,Rachel,"Monica, what are you talking about?"
350,Monica,My Sweet Sixteen!
351,Monica,"Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie."
352,Chandler,"Ahh, third base."
353,Monica,It's all everybody at the party could talk about!
354,Rachel,"Monica, y'know what?"
355,Rachel,The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!
356,Monica,We had a characturist!
357,Rachel,Oh!
358,Phoebe,"""Whenever I get married, guess who won't get to sing?"
359,Phoebe,Somebody named Geller!
360,Phoebe,"And somebody else named Bing!"""
361,Rachel,"Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago."
362,Monica,"And yet, here we are doing it again."
363,Rachel,"Ugh, Monica I don't want to steal your stupid thunder!"
364,Monica,Oh please!
365,Monica,Why else would you have made out with Ross?
366,Ross,Got me.
367,Rachel,"All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain't gonna happen!"
368,Monica,I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
369,Rachel,"I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!"
370,Monica,"Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?"
371,Ross,"Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking."
372,Ross,I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea.
373,Ross,I'm calling it off.
374,Chandler,Why to save your dignity my man.
375,Rachel,"Monica, why?"
376,Rachel,Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
377,Monica,I don't know!
378,Monica,I don'tmaybe you're feeling a little resentful.
379,Monica,"Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first!"
380,Monica,Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
381,Rachel,Oh wow.
382,Rachel,Thaty'know what?
383,Rachel,That is so unfair.
384,Rachel,Y'know what?
385,Rachel,Now I want to steal your thunder!
386,Rachel,"Come on Ross, let's go have sex!"
387,Monica,I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night!
388,Chandler,"Well, somebody should."
389,Ross,"Look uh, if we're gonna do this"
390,Rachel,"We're not gonna do this, all right?"
391,Rachel,She's just gonna think that we're doin' it.
392,Ross,"Oh, I see, so everybody wins."
393,Rachel,Who is it?
394,Monica,"It's Monica, open up!"
395,Rachel,Okay well Ross!
396,Rachel,Stop it please!
397,Rachel,Wait a minute!
398,Ross,Oww!
399,Rachel,"Yeah, you like that baby?"
400,Rachel,May we help you?
401,Monica,"I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant!"
402,Chandler,How is that ever going to happen?
403,Rachel,"All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?"
404,Monica,I know why!
405,Rachel,No you don't know why!
406,Monica,Okay!
407,Monica,Why?
408,Rachel,Because!
409,Rachel,Because I was sad.
410,Monica,What do you mean?
411,Rachel,"Look, I am soso happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I'm not."
412,Rachel,I'm not even close.
413,Rachel,"And I don't know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better."
414,Rachel,"And I know that that's dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!"
415,Chandler,"I don't care, she slept with me."
416,Rachel,"Anyway sweetie, I am, I'm so sorry I ruined your night."
417,Monica,I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
418,Ross,"Well, I'm going to take off."
419,Ross,Congratulations man.
420,Chandler,Thanks.
421,Ross,"And uh, Rachel."
422,Rachel,Yeah.
423,Ross,"What can I say, you missed your chance."
424,Ross,From now on the only person who's going to enjoy these bad boys  is me.
425,Ross,Ending Credits
426,Phoebe,"""We thought Phoebe would leave, but she just stayed and stayed."
427,Phoebe,"That's right, I'm here all night, and Chandler will never get l"""
428,Chandler,Hey!
429,Chandler,"Here's a dollar, consider it a deposit."
430,Chandler,Please sing at our wedding.
431,Phoebe,Oh thank you.
432,Chandler,Okay.
433,Phoebe,"Now  ""Who will perform the ceremony!"
434,Phoebe,Who will perform the cerOhoh!
435,Phoebe,"All right, I'll pound on him in the morning."
436,Phoebe,End
0,Joey,"Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see  that, but.. Let me explain, okay?"
1,Rachel,We weren't doing anything!
2,Joey,"Rach, he just saw us."
3,Rachel,Shhh.
4,Joey,"But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay?"
5,Joey,One kiss.
6,Rachel,"No, come on, that is a lie."
7,Rachel,We also kissed in Barbados.
8,Rachel,Joey
9,Rachel,"Yeah, you started it!"
10,Rachel,I've got to chill.
11,Joey,"Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it  ever happened, but.."
12,Rachel,"We feel so terrible about this, Ross."
13,Joey,"Yeah, but it did happen, so..."
14,Joey,Ross?
15,Rachel,Ross?
16,Rachel,Can we just close the door?
17,Rachel,OPENING CREDITS
18,Rachel,"Ross, say something."
19,Rachel,Anything.
20,Ross,So you two are..?
21,Ross,Joey and
22,Rachel,Yeah.
23,Ross,And have you .. ed?
24,Joey,"No, no, no!"
25,Rachel,"No, no, no!"
26,Ross,"But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?"
27,Joey,Probably.
28,Joey,"No, no!"
29,Rachel,"Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this."
30,Rachel,You have every right to go nuts.
31,Ross,I'm not going nuts.
32,Ross,Do you see me go nuts?
33,Rachel,"No, but you know what I mean."
34,Ross,"Hey, hey, hey..."
35,Ross,"If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you."
36,Ross,I'm fine!
37,Joey,Really?
38,Ross,Absolutely.
39,Ross,I'm fine!
40,Ross,Totally fine.
41,Ross,"I don't know  why   it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really,   I'm fine."
42,Ross,I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys  kissing.
43,Ross,"I mean, at first I was like.."
44,Ross,But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.
45,Joey,Ross..
46,Ross,It's all working out!
47,Ross,"Me & Charlie, and you two."
48,Ross,You know what   we should do?
49,Rachel,Calm ourselves?
50,Ross,No.
51,Ross,We should all have dinner.
52,Ross,"Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night."
53,Ross,I'll cook!
54,Joey,"Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?"
55,Ross,Weird?
56,Ross,What?
57,Ross,What's weird?
58,Ross,"The only thing weird would be if   someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!"
59,Joey,I do like fajitas.
60,Monica,"God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming."
61,Monica,"There's   inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.."
62,Monica,"There are so many ways   to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives."
63,Chandler,There's a hair in my coffee.
64,Phoebe,Hey guys!
65,Monica,Hey.
66,Phoebe,"Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with   the triplets."
67,Chandler,"You know, it's funny."
68,Chandler,"Every time you say ""triplets,"" I   immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds."
69,Monica,That's sweet.
70,Monica,Drink your hair.
71,Phoebe,"Hey, what's all this stuff?"
72,Monica,"Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies."
73,Phoebe,"Ooh, babies!"
74,Phoebe,"Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!"
75,Monica,That's not really how it works.
76,Phoebe,"Oh, how does it work?"
77,Monica,I don't know!
78,Phoebe,"Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my   friends, Bill and Colleen."
79,Phoebe,They adopted a kid.
80,Phoebe,I'm sure they'd help   you.
81,Monica,"Thanks, that would be great."
82,Monica,"Hey, honey, wouldn't that be   great?"
83,Monica,Frank Jr.
84,Phoebe,Hey!
85,Phoebe,Frank Jr.
86,Phoebe,Good to see you.
87,Phoebe,Frank Jr.
88,Monica,Hi Frank.
89,Monica,Frank Jr.
90,Monica,"Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!"
91,Monica,Which one is which again?
92,Monica,Frank Jr.
93,Joey,"Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's   cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our   first date."
94,Rachel,"Well, what would we be doing?"
95,Joey,I'd take you out for a romantic night.
96,Joey,"Some champagne, fancy   dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home..."
97,Rachel,Feel me up?
98,Joey,In a carriage!
99,Joey,"Hey, Charlie!"
100,Rachel,Hey.
101,Rachel,"Oh, you bet."
102,Joey,"So, did you bring a little something for Ross?"
103,Joey,Oh.
104,Joey,"Oh, thanks."
105,Joey,"Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out.."
106,Ross,I thought I heard voices!
107,Ross,Hi Charlie!
108,Ross,Hi Joey.
109,Ross,And.. Oh!
110,Ross,You're gonna have to introduce me to your new   girlfriend.
111,Ross,"I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know."
112,Ross,"Come, please come in."
113,Ross,Come in.
114,Rachel,"Okay, well, we brought you some wine."
115,Ross,Oh!
116,Ross,That is so thoughtful.
117,Ross,She's a keeper.
118,Ross,And what   did you bring me?
119,Joey,"Uh, actually, that's.."
120,Ross,"Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD."
121,Ross,I can use all these   things!
122,Ross,What?
123,Ross,Fine?
124,Ross,Because I am!
125,Ross,Aren't you?
126,Ross,Aren't you?
127,Ross,Aren't you?
128,Ross,You see?
129,Ross,Who else is fine?
130,Joey,"Okay, listen, hey, Ross."
131,Joey,"Why don't you try to relax, okay?"
132,Joey,Maybe   have a drink.
133,Ross,You know what?
134,Ross,That is a very good idea.
135,Ross,I'm gonna go make a   pitcher of Margaritas.
136,Phoebe,"Oh, god."
137,Phoebe,So adorable.
138,Phoebe,Look at them sleeping there like angels.
139,Phoebe,Frank Jr.
140,Phoebe,"Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute."
141,Phoebe,Frank Jr.
142,Phoebe,"Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest   thing.. Frank Jr."
143,Phoebe,"That's a, that's a long time."
144,Phoebe,Frank Jr.
145,Phoebe,"Yeah, I know, Frank."
146,Phoebe,I counted them when they were coming out   of my area.
147,Phoebe,Frank Jr.
148,Phoebe,What?
149,Phoebe,Frank Jr.
150,Phoebe,"Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving?"
151,Phoebe,Because I   didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!
152,Phoebe,Frank Jr.
153,Phoebe,What?!
154,Phoebe,You can't separate them!
155,Phoebe,That's terrible.
156,Phoebe,Which one?
157,Monica,Thank you so much for seeing us.
158,Monica,Phoebe has told us such great   things about you guys.
159,Chandler,"So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this   room, huh?"
160,Chandler,"I mean, you have a lovely home."
161,Monica,"Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us."
162,Monica,Oh my god!
163,Monica,Thank you.
164,Monica,I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
165,Chandler,That's great.
166,Chandler,Can I see the book?
167,Chandler,"You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?"
168,Monica,It's..
169,Monica,It's just so pretty and white.
170,Monica,Can I adopt you?
171,Chandler,"Hey, you must be Owen."
172,Chandler,I'm Chandler.
173,Chandler,"Hey, I was in the scouts too."
174,Chandler,"Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother."
175,Chandler,You know how to use a compass?
176,Chandler,You do?
177,Chandler,That's fantastic!
178,Chandler,"I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your   parents."
179,Chandler,They're telling us all about how they adopted you.
180,Chandler,What?
181,Chandler,I got nothing.
182,Ross,"The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second   batch is gooooood."
183,Rachel,"Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some."
184,Ross,"Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it?"
185,Ross,You know?
186,Ross,Just the four of us.
187,Ross,Just hangin'.
188,Joey,"Dude, are you okay?"
189,Joey,And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?
190,Ross,I'm fine!
191,Ross,"Hey, I'm great!"
192,Ross,I'm just..
193,Ross,I'm just proud of us.
194,Ross,"There's no weirdness, no tension."
195,Rachel,No awareness.
196,Ross,We make a great foursome.
197,Ross,We should do more stuff together.
198,Ross,Ooh!
199,Ross,Let's take a trip.
200,Ross,"Okay, where do you think we - we can go?"
201,Ross,My fajitas!
202,Rachel,"Look, Charlie, I just want you to know."
203,Rachel,Ross is just having a   little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me.
204,Rachel,"You know, he   normally doesn't drink like this."
205,Ross,Fajitas!
206,Ross,"Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!"
207,Rachel,"Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!"
208,Ross,That is gonna hurt tomorrow!
209,Phoebe,"Okay, well, this is crazy."
210,Phoebe,"Can't seriously be talking about me   taking one of your kids, can we?"
211,Phoebe,Frank Jr.
212,Phoebe,Insane.
213,Phoebe,Frank Jr.
214,Phoebe,"Alice would never go for it, right?"
215,Phoebe,Frank Jr.
216,Phoebe,"Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know,   hypothetically."
217,Phoebe,Which one would you be willing to give up?
218,Phoebe,Frank Jr.
219,Phoebe,Frank Jr.Jr.?
220,Phoebe,Frank Jr.
221,Phoebe,Uh-huh.
222,Phoebe,Frank Jr.
223,Phoebe,"Well, alright, that's fine."
224,Phoebe,What about Leslie?
225,Phoebe,Frank Jr.
226,Phoebe,"Alright, so that leaves Chandler."
227,Phoebe,Frank Jr.
228,Phoebe,"Wow, Frank."
229,Phoebe,I think we just ran out of kids.
230,Phoebe,Frank Jr.
231,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, Frank."
232,Phoebe,I didn't realise things were so bad.
233,Phoebe,"You   know, I'll help out more."
234,Phoebe,I can - I can babysit any time you want.
235,Phoebe,"You   name the day, and I'll be there."
236,Phoebe,Frank Jr.
237,Phoebe,"Well, that's not good."
238,Phoebe,"But you know, I can move some stuff   around, and I'll be there."
239,Phoebe,You and Alice just take the whole day   together.
240,Phoebe,Frank Jr.
241,Phoebe,Are you kidding?
242,Phoebe,That's what sisters are for.
243,Phoebe,Frank Jr.
244,Chandler,Where are Bill and Colleen?
245,Monica,They're in the kitchen getting something to eat.
246,Monica,Can you   believe how nice they are?
247,Chandler,We have to leave!
248,Monica,Why?
249,Monica,What did you do in the bathroom?
250,Chandler,I didn't get to the bathroom.
251,Chandler,"I bumped into Owen on the way,   and he didn't know he was adopted."
252,Chandler,And there's a slight chance I may   have told him.
253,Monica,"Oh my god, where's my purse?"
254,Monica,"No, you know what?"
255,Monica,I can replace   everything in there.
256,Monica,"Get that binder, and let's go!"
257,Chandler,But kids are so intuitive.
258,Chandler,Don't you think on some level he   already knows?
259,Chandler,See?
260,Chandler,Intuitive!
261,Chandler,Which technically now you should give back!
262,Chandler,"I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or   something."
263,Chandler,Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the   door.
264,Chandler,"""Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa   is real."""
265,Ross,Everyone?
266,Ross,I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.
267,Rachel,Ooy.
268,Ross,And to love.
269,Ross,"Ah, love."
270,Ross,"L-O-V-E, love."
271,Ross,L is for life.
272,Ross,And what is   life without love?
273,Rachel,"Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?"
274,Ross,"O is for ""oh, wow!"""
275,Ross,"The V is for this very surprising turn   of   events, which I'm still fine with by the way."
276,Ross,E is for how extremely   normal I find it.
277,Ross,That you two are together.
278,Ross,And now one day you might   get married and have children of your own.
279,Joey,"Dude, are you okay?"
280,Ross,Totally.
281,Rachel,"Ross, you don't seem okay."
282,Rachel,Ross
283,Ross,No!
284,Ross,Wasn't it?
285,Ross,And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and   that you never really liked Rachel.
286,Ross,Okay.
287,Rachel,"Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me."
288,Ross,"Okay, I guess it's just flan for three!"
289,Ross,"Hey, hey, that rhymed!"
290,Rachel,"You know what, Ross?"
291,Rachel,I think we're gonna take off too.
292,Ross,"Oh, oh."
293,Ross,Of course.
294,Ross,"God, I'm so stupid."
295,Ross,You guys are a couple   now.
296,Ross,"I mean, you probably just want to be alone."
297,Rachel,"No, no, it's just that it's getting late..."
298,Ross,"Hey, hey, it's fine."
299,Ross,It's totally fine.
300,Ross,We've got plenty of   margaritas.
301,Ross,It's all good.
302,Ross,I don't even know what that's for.
303,Joey,You know what?
304,Joey,I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's   okay.
305,Rachel,"Yeah, that's probably a good idea."
306,Joey,Yeah.
307,Joey,I'll see you in the morning.
308,Rachel,Uh-huh.
309,Rachel,Okay.
310,Rachel,"You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever   gonna be okay with this."
311,Joey,"It doesn't look good, does it?"
312,Joey,Morning.
313,Joey,Here you go.
314,Ross,Thanks.
315,Ross,Did you stay here all night?
316,Joey,Yeah.
317,Ross,So you took off my pants and shoes?
318,Joey,"No, no, no."
319,Joey,You actually did that when you were dancing to the   Chicago-soundtrack.
320,Joey,"Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I."
321,Joey,"Listen, you   don't have to worry about that, okay?"
322,Joey,Because nothing is gonna happen.
323,Ross,What do you mean?
324,Joey,"Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do   anything unless you were okay with it."
325,Joey,And clearly..
326,Ross,"Hey, what are you talking about?"
327,Ross,I'm fine!
328,Joey,"It's okay, Ross, alright?"
329,Joey,I totally understand.
330,Joey,Of course you're   not fine.
331,Joey,You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.
332,Ross,Except we're not.
333,Ross,"I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six   years."
334,Ross,"Oh my god, is that right?"
335,Ross,Has it been that long?
336,Joey,"That's what I hear, yeah."
337,Ross,This is crazy.
338,Ross,"I mean, six years?"
339,Ross,And because of me you guys   aren't gonna be together?
340,Ross,Can I ask you something?
341,Ross,"Really, what is   this thing with you and Rachel?"
342,Joey,"Come on, I mean, you know me, you know..."
343,Ross,Joey.
344,Joey,I'm crazy about her.
345,Ross,And she feels the same way?
346,Joey,I think so.
347,Ross,"Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on."
348,Joey,"Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it."
349,Ross,"No, but I wanna be."
350,Ross,"Hey, I will be."
351,Ross,"Besides, I'm with Charlie,   right?"
352,Ross,"Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I?"
353,Ross,"I mean, she didn't   see the dance, did she?"
354,Joey,"No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me."
355,Joey,Are you sure   about this?
356,Ross,"Yeah, I'm sure."
357,Joey,And we're okay?
358,Joey,ENDING CREDITS
359,Monica,"Hey, Phoebs"
360,Phoebe,Hey.
361,Monica,"Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up."
362,Monica,Bill and Colleen hate   us.

88,Ross,"Jill, how did you pay for all this?"
89,Ross,I thought your dad took away your credit card.
90,Ross,I don't think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
91,Phoebe,"Seriously, I don't Rachel's gonna think it's a good idea."
92,Phoebe,I would love that job!
93,Rachel,Hey!

123,Rachel,"All right, it's okay."
124,Rachel,"One little setback is okay, just don't let it happen again, all right?"
125,Rachel,"Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away."
126,Rachel,But I'm just gonna take the-the pajmena.
127,Rachel,"And the uh, and the uh pants."
128,Rachel,"Y'know what, I'm just gonna take it all away, cause that way you'll just really learn the lesson."

144,Monica,"But y'know if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me."
145,Chandler,That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
146,Monica,Are you saying that you don't wanna get with this?
147,Chandler,"Yeah, I don't you should say that even when you're healthy."
148,Monica,Come on.
149,Chandler,Don't take this personally okay?
150,Chandler,It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
151,Monica,I'm with you Chandler!
152,Monica,"I mean I can't have sex with a sick person either, that's disgusting!"
153,Monica,But I'm not sick!

162,Phoebe,No.
163,Phoebe,No.
164,Phoebe,"It's just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them."

178,Rachel,"Oh my God, and they're gonna have sex!"
179,Rachel,Oh!
180,Rachel,Oh no what if he marries her too?!
181,Rachel,"Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible."

167,Monica,It's the heat.
168,Monica,And-and the humidity.
169,Joey,"That's a uh, that's a tough combination."
170,Monica,Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
171,Joey,Like you wouldn't believe.
172,Joey,Wow!
173,Joey,This is a great place.
174,Monica,Thank you.
175,Monica,Just make yourself comfortable.
176,Joey,Gotcha.
177,Monica,This place is really my Grandmother's.
178,Monica,"I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this."
179,Monica,"So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87 year old woman, who's afraid of her VCR."
180,Monica,So are you thirsty?
181,Joey,"Oh, you bet I am!"
182,Monica,"Okay, here's your penis!"

190,Monica,Yeah huh!!
191,Monica,Cover yourself up!
192,Joey,"Oh right, right."
193,Monica,I don't believe this!
194,Monica,"When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?"
195,Joey,Well usually...yeah!
196,Joey,"Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice."
197,Joey,"Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me."
198,Joey,I'm such a jerk.
199,Monica,It's okay.
200,Monica,"I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it."
201,Monica,Pheebs?
202,Phoebe,Huh?
203,Monica,Where's your bed?
204,Phoebe,It's not in the apartment?
205,Phoebe,Oh no.
206,Phoebe,I can't believe this is happening again.
207,Monica,What?
208,Phoebe,"Okay, enough with the third degree!"
209,Phoebe,"I-I've, I don't live here anymore."
210,Monica,What are you talking about?
211,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, I-I-I-I don't live here anymore."
212,Phoebe,"I-I didn't know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!"
213,Monica,Everybody knows!
214,Phoebe,"That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why."
215,Phoebe,"Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn't sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions."
216,Monica,"Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over."
217,Phoebe,"Yeah, I would've except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side."
218,Monica,What?!?
219,Phoebe,"Okay, this is what I'm talking about, this."
220,Phoebe,I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
221,Monica,You can spill.
222,Monica,In the sink.
223,Phoebe,"Aw, honey it's not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don't see that happening."
224,Monica,"I love you, too."
225,Phoebe,"Aww, good."
226,Phoebe,What?
227,Monica,What?
228,Monica,I'm just said.
229,Phoebe,"No you're not, you're wondering which cushion it is."
230,Chandler,"So ah, whatcha watching?"
231,Joey,Baywatch.
232,Chandler,What's it about?
233,Joey,Lifeguards.
234,Chandler,"Well, it sounds kinda stupid...  Who's she?"
235,Joey,Nicole Eggert.
236,Joey,You'll like her.
237,Chandler,Wow!
238,Chandler,Look at them run.
239,Joey,They do that a lot.
240,Joey,"Hey, you want a beer?"
241,Chandler,"Yeah, I'll go get one."
242,Joey,"No, no, no, don't get up, I got a cooler right here."
243,Chandler,"Well, hello!"
244,Monica,Hey.
245,Chandler,Do you have any beers?
246,Chandler,We're out of beers.
247,Monica,Help yourself.
248,Chandler,You okay?
249,Monica,Phoebe moved out.
250,Chandler,Right.
251,Monica,"I don't understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don't have a boyfriend?"
252,Chandler,Noo!!
253,Chandler,"You don't have a boyfriend because....I don't, I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend."
254,Chandler,You should have a boyfriend.
255,Monica,"Well, I think so."
256,Chandler,"Oh-ho, come here."
257,Chandler,"Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life."
258,Ross,Hi.
259,Ross,Where is everybody?
260,Phoebe,"Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?"
261,Ross,"My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over."
262,Phoebe,Oh no!
263,Phoebe,Why?
264,Ross,Cause Carol's a lesbian.
265,Ross,"And, and I'm not one."
266,Ross,And apparently it's not a mix and match situation.
267,Phoebe,Oh my God!
268,Phoebe,I don't believe it!
269,Phoebe,"Oh, you poor bunny."
270,Ross,I'm an idiot.
271,Ross,"I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I'd be out and she'd, she'd see some beautiful woman, and, and she'd be Ross y'know look at her, and I'd think, God, my wife is cool!"
272,Phoebe,Aw!
273,Phoebe,"Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?"
274,Ross,"Well, now I do!"
275,Phoebe,I'm sorry.
276,Ross,Seven years.
277,Ross,"I mean we've been together seven years, she's the only woman who's ever loved me, and the only woman I've-I've ever...."
278,Phoebe,"Aw, God Ross."
279,Phoebe,Oh.
280,Chandler,"Umm, this is nice."
281,Monica,"I know, it is isn't it?"
282,Chandler,"No, I mean it, this feels really good."
283,Chandler,Is it a hundred percent cotton?
284,Monica,Yeah!
285,Monica,"And I got it on sale, too."
286,Chandler,"Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device."
287,Monica,"Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can."
288,Chandler,"Oh yeah, that sounds great."
289,Chandler,"Oh, and listen, it's, it's gonna be...."
290,Monica,I know.
291,Monica,Thanks.
292,Ross,"Maybe this would've happened if I'd been more nurturing, or I'd paid more attention, or I... had a uterus."
293,Ross,I can't believe this!
294,Phoebe,"I know no, no, y'know you don't deserve this, you don't Ross."
295,Phoebe,"You're, you're really, you're so good."
296,Ross,Thanks.
297,Phoebe,And you're so sweet.
298,Phoebe,And you're kind

300,Ross,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
301,Phoebe,Huh?
302,Phoebe,"Okay, it's okay."
303,Phoebe,Oh.
304,Ross,"Wait, wait, wait."
305,Phoebe,What?
306,Ross,My foot is stuck in the pocket.
307,Phoebe,What?
308,Ross,"No, I can't get it out."
309,Phoebe,"Well, that's not something a girl wants to hear."
310,Ross,"No, come on don't start."
311,Ross,Ouch!
312,Phoebe,What?
313,Ross,Stupid balls are in the way.
314,Ross,", and sit up."
315,Ross,Ross hits his head on the lamp again.)
316,Ross,Oh well.
317,Ross,It probably would've been the most constructive solution.
318,Phoebe,You have chalk on your face.
319,Ross,Huh?
320,Phoebe,"Oh, Ross you're right, I don't know why I always thought this was real grass."
321,Monica,"Hey, are you okay?"
322,Ross,My wife's a lesbian.
323,Joey,Cool!
324,Chandler,"Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross."
325,Ross,Hi.
326,Ross,Closing Credits
327,Chandler,I can't believe you came back.
328,Rachel,Don't say anything.
329,Rachel,"I don't wanna speak, I don't wanna think."
330,Rachel,"I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now."
331,Rachel,Friend No.
332,Rachel,What?
333,Rachel,Friend No.
334,Rachel,"Oh, sorry."
335,Rachel,Friend No.
336,Rachel,"Um,  Barry."
337,Rachel,Her
0,Rachel,I cannot believe that you didn't tell me that we are still married!
1,Ross,Look I was going to tell you!
2,Rachel,When?!
3,Rachel,After the birth of our first secret child?!
4,Rachel,Ross didn't get the annulment; we are still married.
5,Chandler,What?
6,Monica,You're kidding!
7,Phoebe,Oh my God!
8,Monica,Ross!
9,Ross,"Okay, maybe it wasn't my best decision."
10,Ross,But I just couldn't face another failed marriage.
11,Chandler,"Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?"
12,Ross,"Rach, come on, if you think about it, it's actually kinda funny."
13,Ross,"Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it."
14,Phoebe,"Okay, this is inexcusable."
15,Phoebe,I am shocked to my very core!
16,Ross,"Phoebe, I told her you already knew."
17,Phoebe,Another lie.
18,Phoebe,You have a sickness!
19,Chandler,"Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you're not married to anymore of us are ya?"
20,Chandler,Opening Credits
21,Joey,Oh!
22,Joey,"Hey, somebody left their keys."

24,Joey,{Transcriber's
25,Joey,Na-uh!
26,Joey,Hey did anybody lose their keys?
27,Monica,"Joey, why don't you put them in the lost and found?"
28,Joey,There's a lost and found?
29,Joey,My shoe!
30,Chandler,You left a shoe here?
31,Joey,"Well, I didn't realize until I got home."
32,Joey,I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe!
33,Joey,Y'know what?
34,Joey,I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
35,Chandler,"Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe."
36,Joey,Great!
37,Joey,Thanks.
38,Phoebe,"Oh, good, good, you guys are here!"
39,Phoebe,"Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?"
40,Monica,"Oh my God, what a fun day!"
41,Monica,That sounds great!
42,Chandler,"Yeah, all right."
43,Phoebe,"Okay, well I'll bring them by tomorrow morning."
44,Phoebe,"Okay, and uh, by the way, they're not actually puppies, they're Frank and Alice's triplets."
45,Phoebe,"Okay, see ya!"
46,Chandler,Whoa-whoa-whoa!
47,Chandler,What?
48,Phoebe,Please!
49,Phoebe,Please!
50,Phoebe,Please!
51,Phoebe,Please!
52,Phoebe,Oh please!
53,Phoebe,Please!
54,Phoebe,Please!
55,Phoebe,Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I'm nervous cause I've never done that before by myself!
56,Monica,"Don't worry about it Phoebe, we'll absolutely do it."
57,Chandler,"Yeah, I'm gonna pass."
58,Chandler,Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
59,Monica,"Come on Chandler, come on!"
60,Monica,It'll give us great practice for whenpeople with babies come to visit.
61,Joey,"Yeah, it's not mine."
62,Joey,"Yeah, it's  mine."
63,Joey,Me too!
64,Joey,Yeah.
65,Joey,And comfortable.
66,Joey,"Do uh, do you like leather seats?"
67,Joey,It's got em!
68,Rachel,"So, I still have boxes here."
69,Rachel,"I still have boxes at Ross's, and I have nowhere to live!"
70,Rachel,Wow.
71,Rachel,I could so easily freak out right now.
72,Phoebe,What about me?
73,Phoebe,"I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don't have a roommate."
74,Rachel,"Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs."
75,Phoebe,Maybe you could be my roommate!
76,Rachel,Well there's an idea!
77,Phoebe,Yeah!
78,Rachel,That would be great!
79,Rachel,"Wait, how long is Denise gone for?"
80,Phoebe,"Umm, she said she'd be back December 26th."
81,Rachel,"December 26th, huh maybe she's Santa Clause."
82,Rachel,"Oh look who it is, my husband."
83,Rachel,The apple of my eye.
84,Ross,"Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at"
85,Rachel,"Well sure, if you say you're gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you."
86,Rachel,Give me those forms!
87,Rachel,"All right, now I'm gonna do this my way and I don't want to hear a peep out of you!"
88,Ross,"Okay Rach, but"
89,Rachel,Op!
90,Rachel,You're peeping!
91,Rachel,Ross!
92,Rachel,"Y'know what, I just gotwhy?"
93,Rachel,Why did you do this?
94,Ross,Look I told you
95,Rachel,"I don't wanna hear ""Three failed marriages!"""
96,Ross,"Look, if you'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand!"
97,Rachel,"Well, y'know what?"
98,Rachel,Thanks to you I'm half way there!
99,Rachel,Ugh!
100,Rachel,Oh!
101,Rachel,I am so mad!
102,Rachel,"Ross, I don't think I have ever been this angry!"
103,Ross,What about the time I said we were on a break?
104,Rachel,Ugh!
105,Monica,"Pheebs, how's it going?"
106,Phoebe,I'm doing okay.
107,Phoebe,I think it's going well.
108,Phoebe,Do you think they're having fun?
109,Phoebe,Am I talking to fast?
110,Monica,"Nope, sound like me."
111,Monica,"Pheebs, it's going great."
112,Monica,Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
113,Chandler,"Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before?"
114,Chandler,"Oh right, Coach Ruben."
115,Chandler,Do you know what Pheebs?
116,Chandler,"When you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too."
117,Phoebe,"Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies."
118,Chandler,See that's where I think that you're wrong.
119,Chandler,We've been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
120,Monica,What do you mean?
121,Chandler,I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone.
122,Chandler,"Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping."
123,Chandler,"And y'know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around"
124,Phoebe,"That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping."
125,Chandler,"Okay, I'm a rookie."
126,Chandler,I should not be in the end zone.
127,Monica,This is so great!
128,Monica,This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
129,Phoebe,Yeah?
130,Phoebe,Well this is not what I ordered.
131,Joey,Hey guys!
132,Chandler,Hey!
133,Phoebe,Hey!
134,Joey,Hey babies!
135,Joey,"Oh, I'm having the best morning."
136,Joey,"That uh, that Porsche I've got the keys too, still there!"
137,Chandler,Shocking!
138,Chandler,Since you still have the keys.
139,Joey,You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car!
140,Joey,"People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car!"
141,Joey,One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
142,Chandler,What equity investments?
143,Joey,The ones that got me the Porsche!
144,Joey,Will you keep up!
145,Joey,"But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it."
146,Joey,So I figured I'll wash it.
147,Joey,Right?
148,Joey,"Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?"
149,Monica,"Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound."
150,Chandler,You don't even have a car!
151,Monica,I know.
152,Monica,"But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it."
153,Chandler,And?
154,Monica,And six others.
155,Chandler,There you are.
156,Joey,"Yeah, she tops out at 130."
157,Joey,Guy #2
158,Joey,And that's just in the city.
159,Joey,I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.
160,Joey,Guy #2
161,Joey,Sure!
162,Joey,Guy #2
163,Joey,"Okay, take it easy."
164,Joey,The Porsche
165,Joey,Really?
166,Joey,"Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it."
167,Joey,The Porsche
168,Joey,"Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up."
169,Joey,The Porsche
170,Joey,"Yeah, but it's my wax."
171,Joey,The Porsche
172,Joey,Sure.
173,Joey,Here.
174,Joey,"I'll uh, save your parking spot."
175,Joey,The Porsche
176,Joey,Why not?
177,Joey,The Porsche
178,Joey,"Yeah, so did I."
179,Phoebe,I don't know why I was so nervous about this.
180,Phoebe,And I don't know why Frank and Alice are always complaining.
181,Phoebe,This is so easy.
182,Monica,"Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that's the same."
183,Chandler,Check it out!
184,Chandler,Check it out!
185,Chandler,"When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!"
186,Monica,"Chandler, what are you doing?"
187,Monica,That thing can put someone's eye out!
188,Chandler,He can do more than that!
189,Chandler,He can destroy the universe!
190,Phoebe,"No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts!"
191,Phoebe,"And also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up."
192,Chandler,"They're not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective."
193,Chandler,"When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!"
194,Phoebe,What?
195,Chandler,"Glass, sand, whatever."
196,Phoebe,"Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep."
197,Monica,Oh it's so cute.
198,Monica,I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
199,Phoebe,"Oh, I can still do that."
200,Monica,How are you still single?
201,Chandler,All right.
202,Chandler,I thought about it and maybe you're right.
203,Chandler,Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
204,Monica,Good.
205,Monica,What made you change your mind?
206,Chandler,I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
207,Phoebe,How did that happen?!
208,Chandler,"Well, I was trying to prove that I was right."
209,Chandler,Y'know?
210,Chandler,And it turns out I was wrong.
211,Chandler,And now it's lodged in my throat.
212,Monica,Damnit!
213,Monica,"Y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!"
214,Rachel,"Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out."
215,Ross,"Fine, I'm mentally unstable."
216,Ross,What?
217,Rachel,"Uh yes, heroin and crack."
218,Ross,Crack isn't even an intravenous drug!
219,Rachel,"Well, you would know."
220,Ross,"Oh, come on!"
221,Rachel,"Ross, please, I found the magazines!"
222,Ross,"Okay, I'm sorry, this is insane!"
223,Ross,"I-I-I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything!"
224,Ross,"Look, I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!"
225,Ross,And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
226,Rachel,Ugh!
227,Rachel,Ross!
228,Rachel,"Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago!"
229,Rachel,"And could you strike ""Consummated like bunnies"" from the record?"
230,Rachel,"Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think."
231,Ross,That's great!
232,Ross,Are you happy now?
233,Ross,"Look what you did with your funny, funny form!"
234,Rachel,What?!
235,Rachel,Me?!
236,Rachel,What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
237,Ross,And whatWhat are you typing that for?
238,Ross,Did you hear what she said?
239,Ross,We don't get the annulment.
240,Ross,Don't type that!
241,Ross,What?!
242,Ross,Stop typing!
243,Ross,Hey!
244,Ross,Stop typing!
245,Ross,Stop typing!
246,Ross,Stop typing!
247,Rachel,"Okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?"
248,Rachel,"All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!"
249,Ross,Yeah!
250,Rachel,And thank you for your time.
251,Rachel,Commercial Break
252,Joey,So the Porsche guy took his car back.
253,Chandler,But you found the keys to his clothes?
254,Joey,No.
255,Joey,"No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche."
256,Monica,And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?
257,Joey,Of course!
258,Joey,Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car!
259,Joey,Right?
260,Chandler,That is true.
261,Phoebe,"Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun."
262,Joey,"Oh, I've been there."
263,Joey,"Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche."
264,Monica,"Joey, you know you don't actually have one."
265,Joey,Come on!
266,Joey,What are you doing?!
267,Joey,I'm in character!
268,Joey,Would you talk to her!
269,Chandler,"Ahh, I think it just moved."
270,Chandler,It's really poking me.
271,Monica,"All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room."
272,Phoebe,What?!
273,Phoebe,"No, you can't, you can't leave me here with them!"
274,Phoebe,We're baby-sitting!
275,Monica,"The babies are asleep, I'm sure you'll be okay on your own for a while!"
276,Phoebe,But you-you can't leave me with them!
277,Phoebe,We-we're a team!
278,Phoebe,We're playing a zone!
279,Phoebe,They're gonna triple team me!
280,Monica,"He's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital."
281,Phoebe,"But no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's just gonna y'know naturally pass through his system in like seven years."
282,Chandler,I think that's gum.
283,Phoebe,I'm pretty sure it's gun.
284,Chandler,"Okay, listen this really hurts."
285,Chandler,Let's go.
286,Phoebe,A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital!
287,Phoebe,No!
288,Phoebe,"What would, what would Krog do?"
289,Joey,Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?
290,Joey,Porsche.
291,Rachel,This is totally your fault!
292,Ross,My fault?!
293,Ross,You threatened the judge!
294,Rachel,"Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!"
295,Ross,That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
296,Joey,Hi!
297,Joey,How are the Gellers?
298,Rachel,Don't call us that!
299,Ross,The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment!
300,Ross,Now we gotta get a divorce!!
301,Ross,Did a Porsch throw up on you?
302,Joey,Hey!
303,Joey,It's Porsche!
304,Phoebe,"Me taking care of you is no problem, huh?"
305,Phoebe,You guys feel safe.
306,Phoebe,Right?
307,Phoebe,"Okay, I'm gonna take that spit bubble as, ""Yeah, I do!"""
308,Phoebe,"Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I'll set you up with a clean one."
309,Phoebe,"Okay, I'm sorry."
310,Phoebe,I didn't mean to scare you.
311,Phoebe,I just have to clean that up.
312,Phoebe,Okay?
313,Phoebe,"Cause let's face it, we're at Monica's."
314,Phoebe,I broke it.
315,Phoebe,All right.
316,Phoebe,"Well, that's just the way that goes."
317,Phoebe,"Okay, good."
318,Phoebe,Why are there only two of you?
319,Phoebe,Where is Leslie?
320,Phoebe,"Well, you can't answer."
321,Phoebe,Leslie?
322,Phoebe,Where are you Leslie?
323,Phoebe,"Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words!"
324,Phoebe,"Well, look at you!"
325,Phoebe,Hey!
326,Phoebe,You are a little bit mischievous!
327,Phoebe,My gosh!
328,Phoebe,"Oh, you're a lot mischievous!"
329,Phoebe,"Well, it'll dry."
330,Phoebe,"Okay, you sit with your brother and sister nowwho aren't there!"
331,Chandler,Hey!
332,Phoebe,How do you feel?
333,Chandler,"Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours."
334,Phoebe,"Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself!"
335,Phoebe,"I fed em, bathed em, and put em to bed."
336,Chandler,And protected them from a tornado?
337,Monica,Oh my God.
338,Phoebe,"I know, the babies are asleep."
339,Monica,"Phoebe, what, what happened here?"
340,Phoebe,I did it!
341,Phoebe,I took care of the babies all by myself!
342,Monica,But my apartment!
343,Chandler,Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
344,Monica,But the mess!
345,Chandler,Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
346,Monica,"You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out."
347,Monica,Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies!
348,Monica,When will that be?
349,Chandler,"Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!"
350,Rachel,"Oh honey thank God you're home, I was getting worried."
351,Ross,I picked up the divorce papers.
352,Ross,"Uh, I've already signed everything and I put little X's where you need to sign."
353,Rachel,"Oh, little X's!"
354,Rachel,Great!
355,Rachel,That makes up for everything!
356,Ross,"Y'know, I-Iyou've done a lot of stupid stuff too!"
357,Ross,Okay?
358,Rachel,"Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!"
359,Ross,"Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding!"
360,Ross,"Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!"
361,Rachel,Hey!
362,Rachel,Wait a minute!
363,Rachel,That was different!
364,Rachel,I did those things because I was in love with you!
365,Ross,Yeah!
366,Ross,Right!
367,Ross,You're right.
368,Ross,That's very different.
369,Ross,"So let's, let's just sign the papers."
370,Ross,All right?
371,Ross,What?
372,Rachel,Nothing.
373,Ross,"Okay, can we just sign please?"
374,Rachel,Uh-hmm.
375,Ross,Congratulations.
376,Rachel,"Okay Ross, we'rewait a minute."
377,Rachel,"Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession."
378,Ross,What?
379,Rachel,"Well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea."
380,Ross,Excuse me?
381,Rachel,"Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?"
382,Ross,Yeah?
383,Rachel,"And uh, yeah, I didn't really, I didn't want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes."
384,Rachel,"And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married."
385,Rachel,"So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then  to eat a lot of grapes."
386,Rachel,"So umm, sorry I got us into this mess."
387,Ross,"So then if-ifI mean if you think about it, this is all  your fault."
388,Rachel,"Yeah, don't push it though."
389,Ross,"I've got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you."
390,Rachel,I know.
391,Rachel,"I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck."
392,Rachel,"And it wouldn't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut."
393,Ross,"Did I, did I even treat?"
394,Rachel,"No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special."
395,Ross,That may be the most depressing thing I've heard in my life.
396,Ross,I should probably get these to my lawyer's office.
397,Rachel,"Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this."
398,Ross,"Eh, no problem."
399,Rachel,I'm gonna need a copy of those.
400,Ross,Totally.

1,Phoebe,"Yeah, this is fun, couples night."
2,Chandler,"Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often."
3,Monica,"Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away."
4,Chandler,You mean that Portuguese couple?
5,Chandler,"Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it."
6,Ross,"Hey, you guys..."
7,Ross,I have great news.
8,Monica,"Ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner here."
9,Ross,"Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure...!"
10,Ross,Guess what happened at work today...
11,Chandler,A dinosaur died a million years ago?
12,Ross,"Try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh.... My tenure review board met today and I hear it's looking really good."
13,Phoebe,Wow!
14,Ross,Yeah.
15,Ross,"Do you have any idea what this means in academic circles, uh?"
16,Ross,I am gonna get laid.
17,Rachel,Hi you guys.

35,Phoebe,OPENING CREDITS
36,Phoebe,Hey Mon?
37,Phoebe,Was it weird changing your name to Geller-Bing?
38,Monica,"No, no."
39,Monica,It felt nice to acknowledge this.
40,Phoebe,Where did you go to do it?
41,Monica,Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...
42,Chandler,YOU NEVER DID IT!
43,Monica,I'm sorry.
44,Monica,It's just the idea of being an official Bing.
45,Chandler,Hey!
46,Chandler,"I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding."
47,Chandler,Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.
48,Phoebe,Thanks!
49,Phoebe,"Honey, would you want me to take your name?"
50,Phoebe,"All right, let's see, call me mrs Hannigan."
51,Chandler,Mrs Hannigan?
52,Phoebe,What?
53,Phoebe,Can't you see I'm in the middle of something?
54,Phoebe,"Ooh, I like it."
55,Joey,Hey guys.
56,Chandler,Hey Joe!
57,Chandler,We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house.
58,Chandler,You want to come with us?
59,Joey,"No, thank you."
60,Monica,All right.
61,Monica,"I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house."
62,Chandler,"Yeah, come with us."
63,Chandler,You'll see how close it is to the city.
64,Joey,"But no, it's not close."
65,Joey,You said it was in escrow?
66,Joey,I couldn't even find it on the map.
67,Monica,"Joey, please come."
68,Monica,It would mean so much to us.
69,Joey,You know what?
70,Joey,"You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you."
71,Joey,SHOTGUN!
72,Chandler,Damn it.
73,Monica,See you guys later.
74,Phoebe,Okay!
75,Monica,I'll pick you up at eleven.
76,Monica,So glad you're coming.
77,Phoebe,Good for you.
78,Phoebe,That was really mature.
79,Joey,What?
80,Joey,"No, the only reason  I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move."
81,Joey,I'm gonna make them stay here.
82,Phoebe,"Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do."
83,Phoebe,"Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just..."
84,Phoebe,"All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house."
85,Phoebe,You are not gonna talk them into staying here.
86,Joey,"Hey, hey..."
87,Joey,"I can convince people to do anything, you know."
88,Joey,"I bet I can even get Mike to do that ""thing""."
89,Joey,What is it?
90,Joey,I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT!
91,Joey,Goodbye!
92,Rachel,"Hi, I'm here to see mr Campbell... with Gucci."
93,Rachel,The reservation is probably under Gucci.
94,Rachel,"It's spelled like Gukki, which could be confusing."
95,Rachel,Maitre d'
96,Rachel,Oh my God!
97,Rachel,That's my boss.
98,Rachel,You have to seat us somewhere else.
99,Rachel,Maitre d'
100,Rachel,But my... but my boss cannot see me.
101,Rachel,I'm interviewing for another job.

120,Rachel,Mr
121,Rachel,Wha... My resumé?
122,Rachel,I wouldn't...
123,Rachel,I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resumé.
124,Rachel,Mr
125,Rachel,Whatever happened to just singing for  no reason?
126,Rachel,Huh?
127,Rachel,Mr
128,Rachel,What?
129,Rachel,I-I don't.
130,Rachel,Mr
131,Rachel,"No, I-I-I love it there."
132,Rachel,Mr
133,Phoebe,This place is so depressing.
134,Phoebe,If I had to work here I'd kill myself.
135,Phoebe,But you obviously haven't.
136,Phoebe,"I need to change my name, please."
137,Phoebe,"See, I need to change it because I'm-I'm hiding from the law."
138,Phoebe,You're fun.
139,Phoebe,"Okay, well, I just don't, I don't know how it works exactly."
140,Phoebe,"See, my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?"
141,Phoebe,"Well, not anything, I mean..."
142,Phoebe,"Oh, this could take a while."
143,Phoebe,Okay.
144,Phoebe,Hey!
145,Monica,Hey Pheebs.
146,Phoebe,"Oh, not anymore."
147,Phoebe,I changed it today.
148,Monica,"Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan."
149,Phoebe,Wrong again!
150,Phoebe,Apparently you can change it to anything you want.
151,Phoebe,"So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative."
152,Phoebe,So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.
153,Chandler,That's what we were gonna name the baby.
154,Monica,Phoebe!
155,Phoebe,Uh!
156,Phoebe,Princess Consuela.
157,Monica,You seriously changed your name to that?
158,Phoebe,Uh-huh!
159,Monica,"Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?"
160,Phoebe,"Uhm, no."
161,Phoebe,I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.
162,Chandler,"Hey, how'd the interview go?"
163,Rachel,Oh!
164,Rachel,It's not good.
165,Chandler,"You know, I always feel that way after an interview."
166,Chandler,I'll bet it went better than you think.
167,Rachel,"Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren."
168,Chandler,That is a bad interview.
169,Phoebe,"What are you, what are you talking about?"
170,Phoebe,How did this happen?
171,Rachel,"Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything."
172,Rachel,"So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player."
173,Rachel,"And I said ""Wait a minute!"
174,Rachel,"Yes I am."""
175,Rachel,and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.
176,Monica,Oh God.
177,Monica,I'm so sorry.
178,Ross,Hey!
179,Ross,Wha-hoo!
180,Ross,What's this?
181,Ross,"Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne."
182,Ross,Why is this here?
183,Phoebe,Ross...
184,Ross,I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!
185,Ross,All
186,Ross,This is the single greatest day of my professional career.
187,Ross,"Gunther, six glasses!"
188,Ross,"Oh, I thought Joey was here."
189,Ross,Five is good.
190,Ross,"Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow."
191,Chandler,Ooh!
192,Chandler,Israeli champagne.
193,Chandler,And it's vanilla!
194,Ross,I got tenure.
195,Ross,"I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?"
196,Rachel,Oh it... good!
197,Rachel,"Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days."
198,Ross,"Oh, you know what?"
199,Ross,You're gonna get it.
200,Ross,I-I-I-I can feel it.
201,Phoebe,Can you?
202,Rachel,"Ah, all right."
203,Rachel,Here's to Ross!
204,Ross,And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.
205,Phoebe,And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything.
206,Ross,But also knowing it means a lot.
207,Monica,But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.
208,Ross,...that center around work.
209,Chandler,To Ross!
210,Chandler,All
211,Ross,You know what the best part about this is?
212,Ross,I can never be fired.
213,Phoebe,Oh God!
214,Ross,No seriously.
215,Ross,I have job security for life.
216,Ross,"You know, I never have to worry."
217,Ross,"Oh, look at you."
218,Ross,Look  how happy you are for me.
219,Rachel,"No, it's not that."
220,Rachel,I got fired today.
221,Rachel,And I didn't get the other job.
222,Ross,"Rach, I'm so sorry."
223,Rachel,Oh!
224,Ross,Great.
225,Ross,I feel like an idiot.
226,Rachel,"No, it's okay, you didn't know."
227,Ross,Oh...  Little heads-up would have been nice.
228,Monica,Thank you for letting us see the house again.
229,Chandler,And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means...
230,Chandler,"I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you."
231,Monica,"Ah, so glad you decided to come."
232,Joey,Me too.
233,Joey,"Yeah, this place is great."
234,Joey,I'm so happy for you guys.
235,Joey,"Although, you know, I hope you like fungus."
236,Chandler,What?
237,Joey,Fungus!
238,Joey,Yeah.
239,Joey,Place is full of it.
240,Monica,No it's not.
241,Monica,We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.
242,Joey,Okay.
243,Joey,Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.
244,Monica,Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.
245,Joey,Maybe.
246,Joey,So this is the living room huh?
247,Joey,"Ooh, it's pretty dark."
248,Monica,No it's not!
249,Joey,Are you kiddin'?
250,Joey,I think I just saw a bat in the corner!
251,Chandler,"When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?"
252,Joey,Maybe.
253,Joey,"Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know?"
254,Joey,Or any other house for that matter.
255,Monica,"Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here."
256,Joey,"FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay?"
257,Joey,I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound.
258,Joey,Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...
259,Monica,"Joey, we know that's you."
260,Joey,no... hmmmmm... it's not... hmmmmmmmmmm
261,Phoebe,Welcome back!
262,Phoebe,"Oh, me too!"
263,Phoebe,"Well, I'm no longer Phoebe Buffay."
264,Phoebe,Yes I did!
265,Phoebe,Nope.
266,Phoebe,Yep.
267,Phoebe,Why?
268,Phoebe,"It's fun, it's different, no-one else has a name like it."
269,Phoebe,"Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to?"
270,Phoebe,"You're not serious, right?"
271,Phoebe,"Uhu, uhu, well, then, great."
272,Phoebe,"If you love it, I love it."
273,Phoebe,And I love Crap.
274,Joey,Ow!
275,Joey,"Oh, hi, I'm Joey."
276,Joey,My stupid friends are buying this house.
277,Joey,Who are you?
278,Joey,Oh.
279,Joey,I hate my friends.
280,Joey,"Alright, look."
281,Joey,There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening.
282,Joey,Uhm... oh!
283,Joey,Okay.
284,Joey,"You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!"
285,Joey,"Woah, uh!"
286,Joey,"Okay, let's hear your great idea."
287,Joey,Ahh!
288,Joey,There's gotta be a way.
289,Joey,"I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike."
290,Joey,"That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?"
291,Joey,"What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends."
292,Joey,"Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young."
293,Joey,"Me, I'm set in my ways."
294,Joey,"Yeah, yeah, I guess."
295,Joey,"Yeah, maybe."
296,Joey,"I hate to admit it, but you're probably right."
297,Joey,How did you get to be so smart?
298,Joey,Just when I thought we could be friends.
299,Rachel,"Oh, thank you..."
300,Rachel,"Well, now I don't have to."
301,Rachel,"Ross, what is taking you so long?"
302,Ross,"I'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!"
303,Rachel,Mark?
304,Rachel,Oh my God!
305,Rachel,I'm fantastic.
306,Rachel,You remember Ross?
307,Ross,"Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so..."
308,Rachel,"Oh, well,  you're not catching me on my best day."
309,Rachel,"No, but it's good, you know, I'm gonna take some time off and do some charity work."
310,Rachel,"Well, screw charity work."

328,Rachel,Oh.
329,Ross,"No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him."
330,Rachel,What?
331,Rachel,You don't want me to get a job?
332,Ross,"Oh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job."
333,Ross,Maybe make you his SEXretary.
334,Rachel,Ugh.
335,Ross,I'm serious.

349,Chandler,What changed your mind?
350,Joey,"Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing."
351,Chandler,"Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago."
352,Joey,What?
353,Chandler,Ha!
354,Chandler,I'm just messing with you.
355,Joey,That's not funny!
356,Joey,You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts!
357,Monica,"Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?"
358,Joey,What?
359,Joey,I get my own room?
360,Chandler,You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
361,Joey,Oh my God!

363,Joey,"Hey, can I have an aquarium?"
364,Joey,And a sex swing?

392,Ross,That guy Mark.
393,Ross,From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her.
394,Ross,But I know he really wants to sleep with her.
395,Chandler,It's seven years ago.
396,Chandler,My time machine works!
397,Ross,We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her.
398,Ross,But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
399,Monica,So what if he wants to sleep with her?
400,Monica,"I mean, she's single and he's cute."
401,Chandler,Excuse me?
402,Monica,Oh please!
403,Monica,Yesterday on the subway?
404,Monica,You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.

428,Ross,"Can we, can we just stop for a second?"
429,Ross,"Who said something better would come along, huh?"
430,Ross,You didn't believe me.

9,Ross,"Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand."
10,Chandler,"Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand."
11,Ross,Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
12,Chandler,I was shrieking... like a Marine.
13,Ross,All right here.
14,Ross,Watch me execute the three P's of championship play.
15,Ross,Power.
16,Ross,Precision.

30,Joey,And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
31,Phoebe,Have fun.
32,Phoebe,"Oh wait, no, don't!"
33,Phoebe,I forgot I am totally against that now.
34,Joey,What?
35,Joey,Me having a job?
36,Phoebe,"No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights."
37,Phoebe,"Hey, how do you sleep at night?"
38,Joey,"Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day."
39,Joey,"Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong."
40,Joey,"Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy."
41,Phoebe,Really?
42,Chandler,Yes.
43,Chandler,"Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York."
44,Rachel,"Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there."
45,Rachel,Huh.
46,Rachel,"Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs."
47,Rachel,"Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too."
48,Rachel,"Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to."
49,Rachel,"Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry."
50,Ross,"So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh?"
51,Ross,"I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore."
52,Ross,"Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?"
53,Ross,I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
54,Ross,Huh.
55,Ross,"Well, good luck to Dad."
56,Ross,"Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?"
57,Ross,Yeah.
58,Ross,"Four hundred, huh?"
59,Ross,"Well, that sounds do-able."
60,Ross,How much are the boxes?
61,Ross,And what is second prize?
62,Ross,"Well, that makes sense."
63,Ross,"Yeah, Sarah, anything."
64,Ross,"Hi, I'm selling Brown Bird cookies."
65,Ross,"No, hi, I'm, I'm an honorary Brown Bird"
66,Ross,"Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs."
67,Ross,"No, please, please, um, it's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world."
68,Ross,"Okay, okay!"
69,Ross,I'm going.
70,Ross,I'm going.
71,Ross,All right!
72,Phoebe,Hey.
73,Joey,Hey.
74,Joey,"What, what are you doing here?"
75,Phoebe,"Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental."

78,Phoebe,Destiny.
79,Joey,Sure.
80,Phoebe,Yes.
81,Joey,All right.
82,Phoebe,Okay.
83,Phoebe,Yikes!
84,Phoebe,That one doesn't look very fulfilled.
85,Joey,"Oh, that's, that's ah, one of the old ones, he's just taking it to the back."
86,Phoebe,"You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist."
87,Joey,Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
88,Phoebe,"So, what happens to the old guys?"
89,Joey,"Well, they go into the chipper."
90,Phoebe,"Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds?"
91,Phoebe,No!
92,Phoebe,Nooooo!!
93,Joey,Hey!
94,Joey,Hey!
95,Ross,"...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus."
96,Joey,"All right, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's."
97,Ross,"Wait a minute, one box!"
98,Ross,"Come on, I'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes."
99,Ross,"Chandler, what about you?"
100,Chandler,"Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?"
101,Ross,"No, but ah, there's coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes."
102,Ross,"I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night."
103,Ross,Mon?
104,Monica,"All right, I'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it."
105,Monica,I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds.
106,Monica,"Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?"
107,Ross,"Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all."
108,Ross,"But ah, y'know I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time, why don't I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph's."
109,Monica,No.
110,Ross,"Oh, come on, now you know you want em."
111,Monica,"Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this."
112,Ross,"I'll tell you what Mon, I'll give you the first box for free."
113,Monica,Oh God!
114,Monica,I gotta go!
115,Ross,Come on!
116,Ross,All the cool kids are eating em!
117,Rachel,"I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks."
118,Joey,"Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing?"
119,Joey,I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
120,Rachel,"Well, yeah!"
121,Rachel,I'm still pursuing that.
122,Chandler,How... exactly are you pursuing that?
123,Chandler,"Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?"
124,Rachel,"Well, I'm also sending out.... good thoughts."
125,Joey,"If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one."
126,Joey,You need the fear.
127,Rachel,The fear?
128,Chandler,"He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want."
129,Rachel,"Well then how come you're still at a job that you hate, I mean why don't you quit and get the fear'?"
130,Chandler,"Because, I'm too afraid."
131,Rachel,"I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here."
132,Chandler,"Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here."
133,Rachel,Yeah.
134,Rachel,Can't I just look at the handles on them?
135,Rachel,"Okay, fine."
136,Rachel,"Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress?"
137,Rachel,"Because, I don't care."
138,Rachel,I don't care.
139,Rachel,"I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do."
140,Rachel,So I don't think I should do it anymore.
141,Rachel,I'm gonna give you my weeks notice.
142,Rachel,"Gunther, I quit."
143,Chandler,Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee?
144,Chandler,Commercial Break

148,Monica,"Where, where are the mint treasures?"
149,Ross,"Ah, we're out."
150,Ross,I sold them all.
151,Monica,What?
152,Ross,"Monica, I'm cutting you off."
153,Monica,No.
154,Monica,"No, just, just, just a couple more boxes."
155,Monica,"It-it-it's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool."
156,Monica,You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
157,Ross,"Mon, look at yourself."
158,Ross,You have cookie on your neck.
159,Monica,Oh God!
160,Chandler,"So, how many have you sold so far?"
161,Ross,Check this out.
162,Ross,Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
163,Chandler,"Oh my God, how did you do that?"
164,Ross,"Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes!"
165,Ross,"That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, the munchies.'"
166,Ross,"So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight."
167,Ross,I am selling cookies by the case.
168,Ross,They call
169,Rachel,"Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers....."
170,Ross,"Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?"

173,Ross,Well you sure used a large font.
174,Chandler,"Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room."
175,Rachel,Hey-hey-hey that's funny!
176,Rachel,Your funny Chandler!
177,Rachel,Your a funny guy!
178,Rachel,You wanna know what else is really funny?
179,Chandler,Something else I might have said?
180,Rachel,"I don't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do."
181,Rachel,Ha!
182,Rachel,Ha!
183,Rachel,Ha!
184,Rachel,Ha!
185,Rachel,Ha!
186,Ross,"Sweetie, calm down, it's gonna be okay."
187,Rachel,"No, it's not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead."
188,Rachel,"Okay, y'know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna call Gunther and I'm gonna tell him, I'm not quitting."
189,Chandler,You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
190,Rachel,You and your stupid fear.
191,Rachel,I hate your fear.
192,Rachel,I would like to take you and your fear....

204,Joey,Not a problem.

257,Chandler,"Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house."
258,Rachel,I can't!
259,Rachel,It's too late!

120,Joey,What is the big deal?
121,Chandler,What did you just do?
122,Ross,"Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?"
123,Phoebe,You won't even taste it?
124,Ross,No!
125,Phoebe,Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
126,Ross,Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
127,Monica,"Hey, where is everybody?"
128,Rachel,They took Ben to the park.
129,Rachel,Where've you been?
130,Monica,Just out.
131,Monica,"Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me."

134,Rachel,"You can borrow it, by the way."
135,Rachel,"Here are your keys, hon."
136,Monica,Okay.
137,Rachel,"Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?"
138,Monica,You know what probably happened?
139,Monica,Someone musta stolen my credit card.
140,Rachel,And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
141,Monica,That is an excellent excellent question.
142,Monica,That is excellent.
143,Rachel,"Monica, what is with you?"
144,Rachel,Who'd you have lunch with?
145,Monica,Judy.

149,Monica,Jody!
150,Rachel,You were with Julie?
151,Monica,"Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend."
152,Monica,"And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping."
153,Rachel,Oh.
154,Rachel,Oh my God.
155,Monica,"Honey, wait."
156,Monica,We only did it once.
157,Monica,It didn't mean anything to me.
158,Rachel,"Yeah, right."
159,Rachel,Sure!
160,Monica,"Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time."
161,Monica,"Look, I'm sorry, all right."
162,Monica,I never meant for you to find out!
163,Rachel,"Oh, please, you wanted to get caught."
164,Monica,That is not true!
165,Rachel,"Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?"
166,Monica,Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
167,Rachel,"Ok, Monica."
168,Rachel,I just have to know one thing.
169,Rachel,Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's?
170,Rachel,Oh!
171,Rachel,"Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now."

173,Monica,"Hi, who's this?"
174,Monica,"Hi, Joanne."
175,Monica,Is Rachel working?
176,Monica,It's Monica.
177,Monica,"Yes, I know I did a horrible thing."
178,Monica,"Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok?"
179,Monica,"No, I don't care what Steve thinks."
180,Monica,"Hi, Steve."
181,Monica,Carol and
182,Phoebe,"Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out."
183,Ross,I did not freak out.
184,Ross,Because it's breast milk.
185,Ross,It's gross.
186,Ross,"No, no, Carol."
187,Ross,There's nothing wrong with it.
188,Ross,"I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults."
189,Chandler,Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
190,Ross,That would be no.
191,Phoebe,Come on.
192,Phoebe,It doesn't taste bad.
193,Joey,"Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh..."
194,Joey,Exactly.
195,Ross,You've tasted it?
196,Ross,You've tasted it.
197,Ross,"Oh, you've tasted it."
198,Ross,Gimme the bottle.
199,Ross,Gimme the towel.
200,Chandler,Howdy.
201,Joey,Gimme a box a juice.
202,Joey,"Well, they switched me over to Hombre."
203,Chandler,"Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed."
204,Joey,Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it.
205,Joey,"You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day."
206,Chandler,What do you care?
207,Chandler,You're an actor.
208,Chandler,This is your day job.
209,Chandler,This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
210,Joey,"I know, but, I was the best, you know?"
211,Joey,I liked being the best.
212,Joey,I don't know.
213,Joey,Maybe I should just get outta the game.
214,Joey,They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
215,Chandler,"All right, say you do that."
216,Chandler,You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar.
217,Chandler,And then where're you gonna run?
218,Joey,Yeah I guess you're right.
219,Chandler,You're damn right I'm right.
220,Chandler,I say you show this guy what you're made of.
221,Chandler,I say you stand your ground.
222,Chandler,I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
223,Joey,I'm gonna do it.
224,Chandler,All right.
225,Chandler,Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
226,Monica,I don't know what else to say.
227,Rachel,"Well that works out good, because I'm not listening."
228,Monica,"I feel terrible, I really do."
229,Rachel,"Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?"
230,Monica,"Rachel,  say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together."
231,Monica,Is that so terrible?
232,Rachel,Yes.
233,Monica,It's that terrible?
234,Rachel,Yes.
235,Rachel,"Monica, you don't get it."
236,Rachel,"It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you."
237,Monica,Me?
238,Monica,What are you talking about?
239,Monica,Nobody could steal me from you.
240,Monica,"I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you."
241,Monica,"I mean,  you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you."
242,Rachel,I love you too.
243,Phoebe,"You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too."
244,Phoebe,"Oh, I really needed that."
245,Monica,"Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong."
246,Monica,"I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out."
247,Monica,"I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her."
248,Monica,"Would you just give that a chance, for me?"
249,Rachel,"I'd do anything for you, you know that."
250,Monica,I'd do anything for you.
251,Phoebe,"Wait, wait, wait, wait!"

256,Joey,"These new kids, they never last."
257,Joey,"Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'."
258,Joey,"Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?"
259,Rachel,So.
260,Rachel,I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit.
261,Rachel,"I mean, you know, we've never really talked."
262,Rachel,"I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?"
263,Rachel,Really?
264,Rachel,Me?
265,Rachel,"Well, you're not totally paranoid."
266,Rachel,"Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right."
267,Rachel,"Yeah, that'd be great."
268,Rachel,I'd love it.

234,Joey,Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.
235,Joey,I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
236,Ross,"Well sorry, that's what I do on dates."
237,Joey,"All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates."
238,Ross,So let's decide on the spending limit
239,Joey,Yeah.
240,Joey,"Uh, a slicesix dollars?"
241,Ross,I was thinking more like a hundred.
242,Joey,Okay.
243,Joey,Can I borrow 94 dollars?
244,Monica,Oh
245,Phoebe,I know.
246,Phoebe,Hand me a tissue.
247,Rachel,You're out of Diet Coke.
248,Monica,Hello?
249,Monica,What?!
250,Monica,You what?!
251,Monica,Hey you listen here missy!
252,Monica,Wh
253,Phoebe,What?
254,Monica,That was that girl Megan!
255,Monica,She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn't have them back unless I gave her the dress!
256,Phoebe,Does that mean Carcass is available?
257,Monica,What am I gonna do?!
258,Monica,That is the dress!
259,Monica,That is the dress!
260,Monica,WhChandler wants the band.
261,Monica,What do I do?
262,Phoebe,Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
263,Monica,How?
264,Rachel,You're out of toilet paper!
265,Joey,Hey!
266,Ross,Hey!
267,Ross,What's up?
268,Joey,"I just wanted to come by and y'know, wish you good luck on your date."
269,Ross,Oh thanks!
270,Joey,Yeah.
271,Joey,What time are you meeting her?
272,Ross,We have
273,Joey,"Wow, that's in like 20 minutes."
274,Joey,You'd better get dressed.
275,Ross,I am dressed.
276,Joey,Oh.
277,Joey,Well good!
278,Joey,For me.
279,Joey,What is this?
280,Joey,Did you give yourself a facial?
281,Ross,I have an oily T-zone!
282,Joey,Okay dude!
283,Joey,"Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers."
284,Ross,That's right.
285,Joey,You spent a hundred dollars.
286,Joey,That's the limit.
287,Joey,You're screwed!
288,Ross,"Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date."
289,Ross,"So techincally, technically I didn't break any rules."
290,Ross,Thanks for stopping by though.
291,Joey,Oh-oh!
292,Joey,So that's the way it's gonna be huh?
293,Joey,Yeah I can break the rules too y'know!
294,Ross,Oh yeah?
295,Ross,What are you gonna do?
296,Joey,I don't know.
297,Ross,Why am I not surprised?
298,Joey,Y'know what Ross?
299,Joey,I'm not gonna let you get away with this!
300,Ross,I don't think you have much choice.
301,Joey,Well we'll see!
302,Ross,Bye-bye!
303,Joey,Yeah bye-bye!
304,Joey,Hey!
305,Joey,So just a light layer?
306,Ross,Yes.
307,Ross,Yes.
308,Ross,Just here  and there .
309,Chandler,Joey got meat sauce on the banister again!
310,Phoebe,"Yeah, swing music is so out."
311,Monica,"Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work."
312,Chandler,What are you guys talking about?
313,Monica,"Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go."
314,Rachel,"Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced."
315,Rachel,"And now I'm not saying that there's any connection here y'know, but they did tell me that's why they got divorced."
316,Chandler,But I love swing music!
317,Phoebe,Yeah but the Swing Kings?
318,Phoebe,Y'know they suck so much that people actually die at their concertsThey just stop living.
319,Chandler,"Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun!"
320,Chandler,And there's another reason too.
321,Rachel,"Well, what is the other reason?"
322,Chandler,I don't want to say.
323,Rachel,Well you have to because maybe it's stupid.
324,Chandler,Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it wasthe first time I knew thatyou were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
325,Monica,Oh crap!
326,Ross,So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
327,Ross,Yeah.
328,Ross,Oh yeah it's fine.
329,Ross,I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.
330,Joey,Kristen?
331,Joey,Hi!
332,Joey,Oh I like this place.
333,Joey,"And technically, technically I'm not breaking any rules so I"
334,Joey,Hi!
335,Ross,Hi.
336,Ross,It's nice to meet you.
337,Ross,I used to have a friend named Joey.
338,Ross,I don't anymore.
339,Ross,Yeah.
340,Ross,So
341,Joey,Sure!
342,Joey,I would love to wait with you guys!
343,Joey,Thanks!
344,Ross,"So Joey umm, you look familiar."
345,Ross,"Are uh, are you on TV or something?"
346,Ross,That's right!
347,Ross,"That's right, don't you play a woman?"
348,Joey,A woman in a man's body.
349,Ross,Much better.
350,Joey,"So y'know Ross it's funny cause, you look familiar to me too."
351,Joey,Have you ever been married?
352,Ross,"Well yes, yes I have."
353,Ross,"In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I've been married and how I have a son."
354,Ross,That's right!
355,Ross,"Wait no, Ben."
356,Joey,So you've just married the one time then?
357,Ross,Well umm
358,Ross,Yes.
359,Ross,And another time after that.
360,Ross,Boy I'm getting hungry!
361,Ross,"Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?"
362,Joey,Yeah.
363,Joey,"So uh Ross, well nowwhy did that first marriage breakup?"
364,Joey,Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?
365,Ross,No.
366,Ross,No.
367,Joey,No.
368,Joey,It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
369,Ross,Wait a minute!
370,Ross,Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
371,Joey,Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?
372,Ross,Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
373,Joey,Fine!
374,Joey,Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?
375,Ross,Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?
376,Joey,Monkey lover!
377,Joey,When do you think we lost her?
378,Ross,Probably around gonorrhea.
379,Chandler,"Hi, honey!"
380,Chandler,I'm home!
381,Monica,Don't come in here!
382,Chandler,Why?
383,Chandler,Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
384,Monica,No!
385,Monica,We only mess around at his place!
386,Chandler,"Y'know it's funny I started it but, now it's scary me."
387,Chandler,So could you come out here please?
388,Monica,"No, I'm wearing a wedding dress."
389,Chandler,Oh you got a wedding dress?
390,Chandler,That's great!
391,Monica,Yeah but I'm not keeping it.
392,Chandler,Well then why can't I see it?
393,Monica,Oh.
394,Monica,I guess you can.
395,Monica,"Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can't like it."
396,Chandler,Okay I promise.
397,Chandler,I'll-I'll hate it.
398,Chandler,Wow!
399,Chandler,You-you lookhideous.
400,Monica,Really?
401,Chandler,"Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen."
402,Chandler,Wh-why do you to return it?
403,Monica,Oh because it doesn'treally fit.
404,Monica,"Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings."
405,Chandler,Oh that's great!
406,Chandler,Great!
407,Chandler,Thanks!
408,Chandler,But that dress I mean it's like yuck!
409,Chandler,It's terrible!
410,Chandler,It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
411,Monica,Okay!
412,Monica,But you can't rip it.
413,Monica,"Well, maybe a little."
414,Chandler,Okay!
415,Chandler,Ending Credits
416,Monica,Hey guys!
417,Monica,Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding?
418,Monica,Guys?
419,Chandler,I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
420,Monica,All right?
421,Monica,What's going on?
422,Monica,I'm sorry.
423,Monica,I'm sorry.
424,Monica,I-I should probably leave you girls alone.
425,Ross,"Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we're gonna have younger looking skin!"

1,Monica,Oh my God!
2,Chandler,Relax!
3,Chandler,We'll just get her some antacids.
4,Monica,She doesn't have a stomach-ache.
5,Monica,She's in labor!
6,Chandler,Oh my God!
7,Rachel,"So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't    mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong."
8,Rachel,It's because you    mean more to me.
9,Ross,Rach!
10,Rachel,What?
11,Ross,Hey.
12,Rachel,Shh.. Go back to sleep.
13,Rachel,I have to go home.
14,Ross,Oh.
15,Ross,This was amazing.
16,Rachel,It really was.
17,Rachel,You've learned some new moves!
18,Ross,"Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me ""Sex for Dummies"" as a    joke."
19,Rachel,Ah.
20,Ross,Who's laughing now?
21,Rachel,I know!
22,Rachel,OPENING CREDITS
23,Monica,"Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good."
24,Chandler,"Next time, can I say breathe?"
25,Monica,"No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her!"
26,Monica,Can    I get you anything?
27,Monica,You want some more ice chips?
28,Monica,"Alright, I'll be right back."
29,Chandler,Where are you going?
30,Monica,To use the bathroom.
31,Chandler,You can't leave me alone with her.
32,Monica,What?
33,Chandler,This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not    comfortable with!
34,Monica,What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
35,Chandler,"It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone    together."
36,Monica,You'll be fine.
37,Monica,"Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two    minutes."
38,Chandler,Okay.
39,Chandler,"So, ah... Any plans for the summer?"
40,Chandler,Hah.
41,Chandler,May not wanna mention this.
42,Chandler,"So, you ever wonder which    is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?"
43,Chandler,"Well, it's just interesting."
44,Chandler,"You know, because no one will    ever know, because no one can experience both."
45,Chandler,"One of life's great, unanswerable questions."
46,Chandler,"I mean, who    knows?"
47,Chandler,Maybe there's something even more painful than those things?
48,Chandler,Like this.
49,Phoebe,Morning.
50,Joey,Hey!
51,Phoebe,What's that?
52,Joey,It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.
53,Phoebe,It's a baby chick and duck!
54,Joey,Uh-huh.
55,Joey,And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.
56,Phoebe,I did not see that coming.
57,Joey,"Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know?"
58,Joey,It    has that big backyard.
59,Joey,"And then, when they get old, they can go to    that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to."
60,Phoebe,Yes.
61,Joey,Yeah.
62,Joey,It's a shame people can't visit there.
63,Phoebe,"That is the rule, though."
64,Phoebe,Guess what?
65,Phoebe,You're almost an uncle!
66,Ross,What?
67,Joey,"Yeah, Erica went into labor last night."
68,Joey,Monica and Chandler are    at the hospital right now!
69,Ross,Oh my God!
70,Phoebe,"Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl."
71,Ross,"Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl."
72,Phoebe,Have you seen him throw a ball?
73,Ross,Is Rachel here?
74,Joey,"Uh, I think she's still asleep."
75,Joey,"Hey, hey, how did it go with you    guys last night?"
76,Joey,She seemed pretty pissed at you.
77,Ross,"Uh, we, y'know, we worked things out."
78,Phoebe,What's that smile?
79,Phoebe,Did something happen with you two?
80,Ross,"Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have    sex and shut up."
81,Ross,We totally did it!
82,Joey,Oh my God.
83,Joey,You and Rachel?
84,Ross,"I know, it's pretty great."
85,Joey,So what does that mean?
86,Joey,Are you guys getting back together?
87,Ross,"Oh, I.."
88,Ross,I don't know.
89,Ross,We didn't really get to talk.
90,Phoebe,But do you wanna get back together?
91,Ross,I don't know.
92,Ross,It was incredible.
93,Ross,"I mean, it just felt so right."
94,Ross,"When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go."
95,Ross,You know    what?
96,Ross,"Yeah, I do."
97,Ross,I wanna be together.
98,Phoebe,YAY!
99,Ross,Shhh!
100,Phoebe,Yay!
101,Joey,"So, so is she still going to Paris?"
102,Ross,"Wow, I hadn't thought of that."
103,Ross,I hope not.
104,Phoebe,"Oh, this is like the best day ever."
105,Phoebe,Ever!
106,Phoebe,"You guys might get    back together, Monica and Chandler are getting their baby, there are    chicks and ducks in the world again!"
107,Phoebe,"Oh, I feel like I'm in a musical!"
108,Phoebe,"""Daa - raa..."
109,Phoebe,"When the sun comes up, bright and beaming!"
110,Phoebe,"And    the moon comes..."""
111,Rachel,Morning!
112,Phoebe,Guess we'll never know how it ends.
113,Joey,Okay.
114,Ross,Hey.
115,Rachel,Hey.
116,Ross,Hey.
117,Ross,How did you sleep?
118,Rachel,Good.
119,Rachel,You?
120,Ross,Good.
121,Joey,I bet you did!
122,Ross,Uh.
123,Ross,Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
124,Joey,"Sure, yeah."
125,Joey,Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?
126,Rachel,Chick and the duck?
127,Rachel,Didn't they die...
128,Phoebe,Dive.
129,Phoebe,"Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on    the farm."
130,Ross,So...
131,Ross,Morning.
132,Rachel,You too.
133,Rachel,Last night was just wonderful.
134,Ross,It really was.
135,Rachel,I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
136,Ross,"I know, me too."
137,Ross,"It was... You know, it was like one of those    things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's    everything you want it to be."
138,Rachel,Uh-huh.
139,Rachel,I know.
140,Rachel,"It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye."
141,Monica,"It's just a little bit more, honey."
142,Chandler,Is it really that bad?
143,Monica,Oh!
144,Monica,Oh my God!
145,Monica,That is the most beautiful top of a head I have    ever seen!
146,Monica,"Chandler, you have to see this!"
147,Chandler,I'm okay.
148,Monica,"Chandler, you don't wanna miss this."
149,Monica,This is the birth of your    child!
150,Monica,It's the miracle of life!
151,Chandler,Alright.
152,Chandler,"Wow, that is one disgusting miracle."
153,Monica,It's a...
154,Monica,It's a boy!
155,Chandler,Wow!
156,Monica,"Oh, you did it!"
157,Chandler,It's a baby!
158,Chandler,A beautiful little baby!
159,Chandler,And some   other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
160,Chandler,"Well, that's spongy."
161,Monica,"Oh, hey handsome!"
162,Monica,"Oh, I'm gonna love you so much   that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you!"
163,Monica,"Oh, we are so lucky!"
164,Chandler,I know.
165,Chandler,He has your eyes.
166,Chandler,"I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does."
167,Chandler,Okay.
168,Monica,"Oh my God, he's beautiful."
169,Monica,Thank you so much.
170,Chandler,How do you feel?
171,Monica,I...
172,Monica,"I'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?"
173,Monica,We only ordered one!
174,Chandler,"Oh, yeah!"
175,Chandler,These are the faces of two people in the know!
176,Chandler,COMMERCIAL BREAK
177,Chandler,"Well, gosh."
178,Chandler,That makes me feel so special and good.
179,Monica,"Wait, did you know it was twins?"
180,Monica,Anybody tell you?
181,Monica,This is unbelievable.
182,Chandler,Interesting!
183,Chandler,Can I see you for a second?
184,Chandler,What do we do?
185,Monica,"What do you mean ""what do we do""?"
186,Chandler,Twins!
187,Chandler,Twins!
188,Monica,"Chandler, you're panicking!"
189,Chandler,Uh-huh!
190,Chandler,"Join me, won't you?!"
191,Chandler,"Okay, what do you say we keep   one, and then just like have an option on the other one?"
192,Monica,We can't split them up!
193,Chandler,Why not?
194,Chandler,"We could give each of them half a medallion, and    then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited."
195,Chandler,"I mean,    that's a great day for everybody."
196,Monica,"Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?"
197,Chandler,What if they're not?
198,Chandler,What if it's adopted by a king?
199,Monica,"Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt."
200,Chandler,"Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!"
201,Monica,That doesn't matter!
202,Monica,We have waited so long for this.
203,Monica,I don't    care if it's two babies.
204,Monica,I don't care if it's three babies!
205,Monica,"I don't    care if the entire cast of ""Eight is Enough"" comes out of there!"
206,Monica,"We    are taking them home, because they are our children!"
207,Chandler,Okay.
208,Chandler,Shhh...
209,Chandler,Okay.
210,Monica,Okay!
211,Chandler,Okay!
212,Chandler,She?
213,Chandler,It's a girl?
214,Chandler,"Well, now we have one of each!"
215,Chandler,And that's enough!
216,Ross,And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
217,Joey,Oh my God!
218,Joey,What did you say?
219,Ross,Nothing!
220,Ross,What do you say to that?
221,Phoebe,"Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!"
222,Ross,No way!
223,Joey,You can't just give up!
224,Joey,Is that what a dinosaur would do?
225,Ross,What?
226,Joey,"Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language."
227,Phoebe,"Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together."
228,Phoebe,"If    she did, she might feel differently."
229,Phoebe,She might not even go.
230,Ross,You really think so?
231,Phoebe,I'm telling you!
232,Phoebe,"Oh, okay!"
233,Phoebe,This is the part of the musical    where there'd be a really good convincing song.
234,Phoebe,"""Bam-bam,    don't take no for an answer."
235,Phoebe,"Bam-bam, don't let love fly away."
236,Phoebe,"Bam-bam-bam-bam..."""
237,Rachel,Hi!
238,Phoebe,Can't a girl finish a song around here?
239,Joey,Hey!
240,Rachel,Hi!
241,Rachel,So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.
242,Ross,Okay.
243,Joey,"Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?"
244,Rachel,"No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and    then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday."
245,Phoebe,"Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old?"
246,Phoebe,"Good luck, mom."
247,Rachel,Are you kidding?
248,Rachel,Eight hours with my mother talking about    Atkins?
249,Rachel,"Good luck, Emma!"
250,Ross,"Alright, you know what?"
251,Ross,You're right.
252,Ross,I should at least tell her   how I feel.
253,Joey,"Ross, wait!"
254,Ross,What?
255,Ross,What?
256,Joey,Could you get me a muffin?
257,Rachel,Yeah?
258,Rachel,Gunther... Oh...
259,Rachel,I love you too.
260,Rachel,"Probably not in the   same way, but I do."
261,Rachel,"And, and when I'm in a café, having coffee, or I   see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I'll think of you."
262,Rachel,Aw.
263,Rachel,Oh... Bye guys.
264,Ross,Oh my God!
265,Phoebe,Unbelievable!
266,Joey,"Hey, you know what might help?"
267,Ross,I'm not getting you a muffin!
268,Monica,Do you think they recognize each other from in there?
269,Chandler,Maybe.
270,Chandler,"Unless they're like two people who have lived in    apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're    pushed through a vagina and they meet."
271,Monica,There's something that we wanna tell you.
272,Monica,We decided to name    the girl-baby Erica.
273,Monica,"Son of a gun, it is!"
274,Monica,"Okay, well, bye!"
275,Chandler,Bye!
276,Monica,We'll call you!
277,Chandler,Have fun at church-camp!
278,Monica,"Oh, look at these little bunnies!"
279,Chandler,I know!
280,Chandler,You ready to trade?
281,Monica,Okay.
282,Chandler,Okay.
283,Monica,"Alright, let's see.."
284,Chandler,We could trade later.
285,Monica,"Yeah, I'm good."
286,Phoebe,"Hey, what are you working on?"
287,Joey,It's a...
288,Joey,"It's a ""welcome home"" sign for the baby."
289,Phoebe,How sweet!
290,Phoebe,"Oh, is that the baby?"
291,Joey,"No, I sat in the paint."
292,Ross,Hey.
293,Phoebe,Hey.
294,Phoebe,"So, did you talk to Rachel?"
295,Ross,"No, and I'm not going to."
296,Phoebe,What?
297,Joey,Why not?
298,Ross,Because she's just going to shoot me down.
299,Ross,You guys saw what    happened with Gunther.
300,Ross,That did not look like fun.
301,Phoebe,How can you compare yourself to Gunther?
302,Phoebe,"I mean, sure, he's    sexy in a more obvious way."
303,Phoebe,"You have a relationship with her, you    slept together last night."
304,Ross,"Yeah, and she still wants to go!"
305,Ross,It's pretty clear where she is.
306,Joey,"Yeah, I know what you mean."
307,Joey,"I mean, sometimes..."
308,Phoebe,"Uh, Joe?"
309,Joey,Damn it!
310,Ross,"Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now."
311,Ross,Okay?
312,Ross,I'll be seeing her again.
313,Ross,We've got time.
314,Phoebe,"No, you don't!"
315,Phoebe,She's going to Paris!
316,Phoebe,She is going to meet    somebody.
317,Phoebe,Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris?
318,Phoebe,It's...
319,Phoebe,It's a city of Gunthers!
320,Phoebe,Hey!
321,Phoebe,What do you have there?
322,Ross,Oh my God!
323,Ross,You did that yourself?
324,Phoebe,"Honey, that's gorgeous!"
325,Joey,"You know, the baby can't read, Mike!"
326,Rachel,Hi!
327,Rachel,"You guys, the car-service just got here."
328,Rachel,I can't believe   they're not home yet!
329,Rachel,I have to catch my stupid plane.
330,Rachel,I wanna see the   baby!
331,Joey,Monica just called from the cab.
332,Joey,She said they should be here   any minute.
333,Joey,"And apparently, there's some big surprise."
334,Phoebe,"Yeah, did she sound happy about it?"
335,Phoebe,"'Cause my friend Ethel's   baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard."
336,Rachel,Oh my God!
337,Ross,Oh my God!
338,Rachel,Hi!
339,Rachel,Oh my gosh!
340,Chandler,Hey.
341,Chandler,"Phoebe, Ross,"
342,Rachel,Hey.
343,Joey,"Hey, so what is the big surprise?"
344,Rachel,Oh.
345,Ross,Oh my God!
346,Rachel,What... What...
347,Ross,"Okay, okay, awkward question."
348,Ross,"The hospital knows you took two,    right?"
349,Monica,"Yes, it's twins!"
350,Ross,Oh my God.
351,Joey,"Oh, they're so cute!"
352,Joey,"Now, what, what kinds are they?"
353,Monica,"This is a boy,  and that's a girl."
354,Chandler,Her name is Erica.
355,Rachel,Aw..
356,Joey,"Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica."
357,Chandler,Yeah.
358,Chandler,It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time   together.
359,Monica,"Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad."
360,Ross,"Aw, he's gonna be so happy."
361,Phoebe,"Oh, Jack Bing."
362,Phoebe,I love that.
363,Phoebe,"Ooh, it sounds like a '40s   newspaper guy, you know?"
364,Phoebe,"""Jack Bing, Morning Gazette."
365,Phoebe,"I'm gonna blow   this story wide open!"""
366,Rachel,Oh my gosh.
367,Rachel,"Wow, so beautiful."
368,Phoebe,Oh yeah?
369,Phoebe,"Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my   coat."
370,Phoebe,One?
371,Phoebe,How about a whole bunch?
372,Phoebe,Yeah!
373,Phoebe,"Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the   Von Trapp family!"
374,Phoebe,Only without the Nazis.
375,Phoebe,Although that sounds kinda   dull.
376,Rachel,"Oh, you guys, I can't believe this."
377,Rachel,"But I'll leave now, or I'm   gonna miss my plane."
378,Monica,I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.
379,Rachel,Me too.
380,Rachel,"Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to watch   you two attempt to handle this!"
381,Rachel,"Alright, I can't say goodbye to you   guys again."
382,Rachel,I love you all so much.
383,Monica,I love you.
384,Chandler,I love you.
385,Monica,Call us when you get there.
386,Rachel,I will.
387,Rachel,"Ross, come here."
388,Rachel,I just want you to know.. Last night..
389,Rachel,I'll never forget it.
390,Ross,Neither will I.
391,Rachel,"Alright, now I really have to go."
392,Rachel,Okay.
393,Rachel,Au revoir!
394,Rachel,"Oh, they're    gonna really hate me over there."
395,Phoebe,"So, you just let her go?"
396,Ross,Yeah.
397,Joey,"Hey, maybe that's for the best."
398,Ross,Yeah?
399,Joey,Yeah.
400,Joey,You know?
401,Joey,"You just... Look, you gotta... You gotta think    about last night the way she does, okay?"
402,Joey,"Maybe, maybe sleeping    together was the perfect way to say goodbye?"
403,Phoebe,But now she'll never know how he feels!
404,Joey,Maybe that's okay.
405,Joey,You know?
406,Joey,"Maybe, maybe it is better this way?"
407,Joey,"I mean, now, now you can move on."
408,Joey,"I mean, you've been trying to for so   long, maybe now that you're on different continents.."
409,Joey,Right?
410,Joey,Maybe now you can actually do it.
411,Joey,You know?
412,Joey,You can finally get   over her.
413,Ross,"Yeah, that's true."
414,Ross,Except I don't wanna get over her.
415,Joey,What?
416,Ross,I don't!
417,Ross,I wanna be with her.
418,Joey,Really?
419,Ross,"Yeah, I'm gonna go after her."
420,Joey,"Yeah, you are!"
421,Phoebe,Woo!
422,Phoebe,"Wait, wait!"
423,Phoebe,Get your coat!
424,Phoebe,Get your coat!
425,Ross,My coat...
426,Joey,This is so cool!
427,Chandler,"I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!"
428,Joey,"But Ross, Ross."
429,Joey,"What do you, what do you think she's going to   say?"
430,Ross,"I don't know, but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least   I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened."
431,Ross,Where - where is my coat?
432,Phoebe,You didn't bring one!
433,Phoebe,"My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to   the airport."
434,Ross,"Okay, guys, wish me luck."
435,Phoebe,Hurry!
436,Joey,"Good luck, good luck!"
437,Ross,There's no seatbelt!
438,Phoebe,That's okay.
439,Phoebe,"If - if we hit anything, the engine will explode,    so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car."
440,Ross,"Alright, alright, let's do this!"
441,Phoebe,Okay!
442,Ross,Hey!
443,Phoebe,I - I don't take passengers.
444,Ross,"No, you don't understand."
445,Ross,This isn't a real cab.
446,Phoebe,"My medallion number is, ""Get out of the cab!"""
447,Ross,Get out of the cab!
448,Phoebe,Get out of the cab!
449,Joey,"Oh, hey, hey, can I give you guys your house-warming present    now?"
450,Monica,"Now, that you can do."
451,Joey,Alright!
452,Joey,Ah... Chick Jr.?
453,Joey,Duck Jr.?
454,Joey,Don't hide from mama!
455,Phoebe,You can open your eyes now.
456,Ross,Are we off the bridge?
457,Phoebe,Yes.
458,Ross,Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
459,Phoebe,"Yes, she jumped right back up."
460,Ross,"Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down!"
461,Phoebe,Do you wanna get to Rachel in time?
462,Ross,"Yes, but I don't wanna die in your cab!"
463,Phoebe,You should have thought of that before you got in!
464,Phoebe,Toll-booth.
465,Ross,What?
466,Phoebe,Toll-booth!
467,Phoebe,Four bucks.
468,Phoebe,There are quarters in the    glove compartment.
469,Phoebe,Hurry!
470,Ross,Okay!
471,Phoebe,Okay.
472,Phoebe,"Damn, that window is clean."
473,Joey,"Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack,   quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack..."
474,Chandler,"We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but   now we understand you were doing this."
475,Joey,"Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift,   I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!"
476,Chandler,Really?
477,Chandler,You got us a chick and a duck?
478,Monica,"Oh, great!"
479,Monica,Just what you want for a new house with infants.
480,Monica,Bird feces.
481,Joey,"Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now   they're gone!"
482,Chandler,"Oh, don't worry, we'll find them."
483,Monica,"Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins."
484,Chandler,Alright.
485,Monica,Oh God!
486,Monica,What did I just step on?
487,Joey,Oh!
488,Chandler,"It's okay, it's just an egg roll."
489,Monica,Oh..
490,Joey,You stepped on my egg roll?
491,Monica,"I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the    floor."
492,Joey,Just put it on a plate and leave.
493,Chandler,"Okay, let's find these birds."
494,Joey,Alright.
495,Joey,"Wait, wait."
496,Joey,Do you hear that?
497,Joey,Oh!
498,Joey,They're in the table!
499,Chandler,"Well, that can't be good!"
500,Joey,We gotta get them out of there!
501,Chandler,How?
502,Joey,"Oh, oh!"
503,Joey,Maybe we can lure them out.
504,Joey,You know any birdcalls?
505,Chandler,"Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman."
506,Joey,"Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little."
507,Chandler,"Joey, wait!"
508,Chandler,The ball!
509,Joey,Oh!
510,Joey,Oh God!
511,Joey,So what do we do?
512,Chandler,I don't know.
513,Chandler,Maybe we can open this up somehow.
514,Joey,Okay.
515,Chandler,No...
516,Chandler,It's all glued together.
517,Joey,Does that mean we have to bust it open?
518,Chandler,I don't know.
519,Chandler,Maybe.
520,Joey,Oh my God!
521,Chandler,I know!
522,Chandler,It's..
523,Chandler,It's the foosball table.
524,Joey,"All right, you know what?"
525,Joey,We don't have a choice.
526,Joey,It's like I would    have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part.
527,Joey,"""Those are our    men in there, we have to get them out!"
528,Joey,"Even if I have to sacrifice the    most important thing in my life; my time-machine."""
529,Chandler,Did that movie ever get made?
530,Joey,It did not.
531,Phoebe,"Ross, where are you going?"
532,Ross,"To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the    death-cab?"
533,Phoebe,What?
534,Phoebe,What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate?
535,Phoebe,Have    you never chased anyone through the airport before?
536,Ross,Not since my cop-show got cancelled.
537,Phoebe,You have to get a ticket to get past security.
538,Ross,What?
539,Ross,We're never gonna make it!
540,Phoebe,Not with that attitude!
541,Phoebe,"Now, haul ass!"
542,Ross,"Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great."
543,Rachel,Oh my God!
544,Rachel,"I was so afraid I wasn't gonna remember any of my    high-school French, but I understood every word you just said!"
545,Rachel,Gate attendant #1
546,Rachel,Oh.
547,Rachel,"Oh, shoot."
548,Rachel,I had it.
549,Rachel,"Oh, I can't believe this."
550,Rachel,Gate attendant #1
551,Rachel,"I have it, I have it, I have it."
552,Rachel,"Oh, okay, I can't find it,    but I remember that I was in seat 32C, because that's my bra-size."
553,Rachel,Gate attendant #1
554,Rachel,"Okay, fine!"
555,Rachel,But you know what?
556,Rachel,"If I was in 36D, we would not  be having this problem."
557,Ross,"Hey, I need a ticket."
558,Phoebe,Just one?
559,Phoebe,"I drive you all the way down here, and I don't get    to see how it works out?"
560,Ross,"Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets."
561,Phoebe,We're on our honeymoon.
562,Phoebe,Ticket
563,Ross,I don't care.
564,Ross,Whatever is the cheapest.
565,Phoebe,I'm so lucky I married you.
566,Rachel,Oh!
567,Rachel,Shoot!
568,Rachel,Damn it!
569,Rachel,Where is it?
570,Rachel,Oh!
571,Rachel,Oh!
572,Rachel,I found it!
573,Rachel,I found    it!
574,Rachel,Hah!
575,Rachel,I found it!
576,Rachel,I told you I would find it!
577,Rachel,In your face!
578,Rachel,You're a different person.
579,Ross,"Okay, flight 421 to Paris."
580,Ross,"I don't see it, do you see it?"
581,Phoebe,"No, did we miss it?"
582,Ross,"No, no, no."
583,Ross,That's impossible.
584,Ross,It doesn't leave for another 20    minutes.
585,Phoebe,Maybe we have the flight-number wrong.
586,Phoebe,God.
587,Monica,Hello.
588,Phoebe,"Hey, it's me."
589,Phoebe,Here's Ross.
590,Ross,What?
591,Ross,"Hey, hey, listen.."
592,Monica,Oh my God!
593,Monica,"Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises    the twins are making."
594,Monica,Listen.
595,Ross,Monica?
596,Ross,"Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?"
597,Monica,"Oh, I'm sorry."
598,Monica,"Shoot, they were doing it before."
599,Ross,That's alright.
600,Ross,"Listen, listen."
601,Monica,"Oh, wait, wait, wait!"
602,Monica,Here they go again.
603,Ross,Monica?
604,Ross,"Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?"
605,Monica,Isn't that cute?
606,Ross,That is precious!
607,Ross,Listen!
608,Ross,I need Rachel's flight information.
609,Monica,"Oh, okay."
610,Monica,"Alright, it's flight 421."
611,Monica,Leaves at
612,Ross,"Yes, that's what I have."
613,Ross,It's not on the board.
614,Monica,That's what it says here.
615,Monica,"Flight 421, leaves at"
616,Ross,What?
617,Monica,Newark airport.
618,Monica,"Why, where are you?"
619,Ross,JFK.
620,Joey,"Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of    there."
621,Chandler,"And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids."
622,Joey,Okay.
623,Joey,Here goes.
624,Chandler,What's the matter?
625,Joey,I need to say goodbye to the table first.
626,Chandler,I understand.
627,Joey,Okay.
628,Joey,"Table, you have given us so many great times."
629,Joey,"And you    guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys."
630,Joey,What can I say?
631,Joey,You    guys make us look good.
632,Joey,You wanna say anything?
633,Chandler,I don't know.
634,Chandler,"Except that, for one last time...  Good game, good game, good game,    good game, good game, good game, good game."
635,Joey,"Okay, here we go."
636,Joey,I can't do it.
637,Chandler,"Well, I can't do it either."
638,Monica,Hey!
639,Monica,Did you find them?
640,Joey,"Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!"
641,Chandler,"We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!"
642,Monica,"Oh, well sure."
643,Monica,This gotta be so hard.
644,Monica,I'll do it.
645,Monica,Gimme!
646,Ross,Phoebe!
647,Ross,Wow!
648,Ross,"No, no, no!"
649,Phoebe,"Well, I've never gone this fast before."
650,Ross,"Phoebe, forget it, okay?"
651,Ross,Newark is - is like an hour away.
652,Ross,There's no way we're gonna make it in time.
653,Phoebe,"She's got her cell, you could call her."
654,Ross,I am not doing this over the phone.
655,Phoebe,You don't have any other choice!
656,Rachel,Hello?
657,Phoebe,Rachel?
658,Phoebe,"Oh, good."
659,Phoebe,"Hey, by the way, did you just get on the    plane?"
660,Rachel,Yeah.
661,Phoebe,"For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport."
662,Ross,Yay.
663,Phoebe,"Uh, Rach, hang on."
664,Rachel,Phoebe?
665,Rachel,Is everything okay?
666,Phoebe,"Uhm, actually no."
667,Phoebe,"No, you've... You have to get off the plane."
668,Rachel,What?
669,Rachel,Why?
670,Phoebe,I have this feeling that something's wrong with it.
671,Phoebe,Something    is wrong with the left Philange.
672,Rachel,"Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane."
673,Rachel,"Alright, look, I have to go."
674,Rachel,"I love you, and I will call you    the minute I get to Paris."
675,Rachel,Passenger #1
676,Rachel,"Oh, that was just my crazy friend."
677,Rachel,"She told me I should get    off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something    wrong with the left Philange."
678,Rachel,Passenger #1
679,Rachel,I wouldn't worry about it.
680,Rachel,"She's always coming up with stuff    like this, and you know what?"
681,Rachel,She's almost never right.
682,Rachel,Passenger #1
683,Rachel,Well...
684,Rachel,"Wait, what are you doing?"
685,Rachel,Passenger #1
686,Rachel,Could I get some peanuts?
687,Rachel,Passenger #2
688,Rachel,This is ridiculous!
689,Rachel,I...
690,Rachel,"Yeah, okay."
691,Monica,Alright.
692,Monica,My job here is done.
693,Chandler,That was...
694,Chandler,Impressive.
695,Joey,"Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!"
696,Monica,"Yeah, they were just slowing me down."
697,Monica,"Alright, I have to get    back to the babies."
698,Monica,I'll see you girls later.
699,Chandler,"Sorry about the table, man."
700,Joey,Yeah.
701,Chandler,You gonna buy a new one?
702,Joey,Probably not.
703,Joey,Nah.
704,Joey,I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play    after you go.
705,Chandler,"Well, at least we got these little guys out."
706,Joey,Yeah.
707,Chandler,"Aww, we were worried about you!"
708,Chandler,Hm.
709,Chandler,"I guess I better get    used to things crapping in my hand, huh?"
710,Joey,I'm gonna miss these little guys.
711,Joey,It was nice having birds    around again.
712,Chandler,"Hey, you know what?"
713,Chandler,Maybe we should keep them here with you.
714,Joey,What?
715,Chandler,"Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now."
716,Chandler,"And, plus,    here they'd have their own room."
717,Joey,I could get a goose!
718,Chandler,"You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry."
719,Joey,Thanks man.
720,Joey,"Did you hear that, you guys?"
721,Joey,You're gonna get to    stay here!
722,Joey,"And, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a    reason to come visit."
723,Chandler,I think there may be another reason.
724,Chandler,"So, awkward hug or lame    cool guy handshake?"
725,Joey,"Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah."
726,Ross,Where is she?
727,Phoebe,I don't see her.
728,Ross,Rachel!
729,Ross,Rachel Green!
730,Phoebe,There she is!
731,Ross,Rachel!
732,Ross,Rachel!
733,Ross,Gate attendant #2
734,Ross,"No, no, I just have to talk to someone."
735,Ross,Gate attendant #2
736,Ross,"No, no, no, but..."
737,Phoebe,RACHEL!
738,Rachel,Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here?
739,Phoebe,"Okay, you're on."
740,Rachel,What?
741,Rachel,What?
742,Rachel,"Ross, you're scaring me."
743,Rachel,What's going on?
744,Ross,"Okay, the thing is.."
745,Rachel,Yeah?
746,Ross,Don't go.
747,Rachel,What?
748,Ross,"Please, please stay with me."
749,Ross,I am so in love with you.
750,Ross,"Please,    don't go."
751,Rachel,Oh my God.
752,Ross,"I know, I know."
753,Ross,"I shouldn't have waited 'till now to say it, but    I'm.. That was stupid, okay?"
754,Ross,"I'm sorry, but I'm telling you now."
755,Ross,I    love you.
756,Ross,Do not get on this plane.
757,Ross,Gate attendant #2
758,Ross,"Hey, hey."
759,Ross,I know you love me.
760,Ross,I know you do.
761,Ross,Gate attendant #2
762,Rachel,I - I have to get on the plane.
763,Ross,"No, you don't."
764,Rachel,"Yes, I do."
765,Ross,"No, you don't."
766,Rachel,"They're waiting for me, Ross."
767,Rachel,"I can't do this right now, I'm    sorry."
768,Rachel,I'm sorry.
769,Ross,Rachel?
770,Rachel,I'm so sorry.
771,Ross,I really thought she'd stay.
772,Phoebe,I'm sorry.
773,Monica,"Well, that's it."
774,Monica,Everything's packed.
775,Chandler,"Wow, this is weird."
776,Monica,I know.
777,Joey,Yeah.
778,Joey,"Uh, does this mean there's nothing to eat?"
779,Monica,I put three lasagnas in your freezer.
780,Joey,I love you!
781,Joey,Hey!
782,Phoebe,Hey.
783,Joey,So did you guys make it in time?
784,Phoebe,"Yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway."
785,Chandler,Where's Ross?
786,Phoebe,He went home.
787,Phoebe,He didn't want to see anybody.
788,Rachel,"Ross, hi."
789,Rachel,It's me.
790,Rachel,I just got back    on the plane.
791,Rachel,And I just feel awful.
792,Rachel,That is so not how I wanted    things to end with us.
793,Rachel,"It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you,    and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... And... And    now I'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have    said, and I didn't."
794,Rachel,"I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love    you too."
795,Rachel,Because of course I do.
796,Rachel,I love you.
797,Rachel,I love you.
798,Rachel,I love you.
799,Rachel,What am I doing?
800,Rachel,I love you!
801,Rachel,"Oh, I've gotta see you."
802,Rachel,I've gotta get    off this plane.
803,Ross,Oh my God!
804,Rachel,Excuse me?
805,Rachel,Air
806,Rachel,I'm sorry.
807,Rachel,"I'm really sorry, but I    need to get off the plane, okay?"
808,Rachel,I need to tell someone that I love    love them.
809,Rachel,Air
810,Ross,Let her off the plane!
811,Ross,Air
812,Rachel,"Oh, please, miss, you don't    understand!"
813,Ross,Try to understand!
814,Rachel,"Oh, come on, miss, isn't there any    way that you can just let me off..."
815,Ross,No!
816,Ross,No!
817,Ross,Oh my God.
818,Ross,Did she get off the plane?
819,Ross,Did she get off    the plane?
820,Rachel,I got off the plane.
821,Ross,You got off the plane.
822,Rachel,I do love you.
823,Ross,"I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again."
824,Rachel,Okay.
825,Rachel,"'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay?"
826,Rachel,No more messing    around.
827,Rachel,I don't wanna mess this up again.
828,Ross,"Me neither, okay?"
829,Ross,We are - we're done being stupid.
830,Rachel,Okay.
831,Rachel,"You and me, alright?"
832,Rachel,This is it.
833,Ross,This is it.
834,Ross,Unless we're on a break.
835,Ross,Don't make jokes now.
836,Monica,"Okay, please be careful with that."
837,Monica,It was my grandmother's.
838,Monica,Be    careful.
839,Monica,"If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing."
840,Ross,Wow.
841,Rachel,I know.
842,Rachel,It seems smaller somehow.
843,Joey,Has it always been purple?
844,Chandler,"Look around, you guys."
845,Chandler,This was your first    home.
846,Chandler,"And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter."
847,Chandler,"But    more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!"
848,Phoebe,"Hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived    in this apartment?"
849,Monica,"Oh, yeah, that's true."
850,Ross,"Uh, I haven't."
851,Monica,Wait a minute.
852,Monica,"What about that summer during college that you    lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer?"
853,Ross,Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming    up?
854,Monica,"Oh, honey, I forgot."
855,Monica,I promised Treeger that we'd leave our    keys.
856,Chandler,"Oh, okay."
857,Phoebe,"So, I guess this is it."
858,Joey,Yeah.
859,Joey,I guess so.
860,Monica,This is harder than I thought it would be.
861,Chandler,"Oh, it's gonna be okay."
862,Rachel,"Do you guys have to go to the new house right away,    or do you have some time?"
863,Monica,We got some time.
864,Rachel,"Okay, should we get some coffee?"
865,Chandler,Sure.
866,Chandler,Where?
867,Chandler,THE END
0,Chandler,Did you see our bank statement?
1,Chandler,Can this be right?
2,Monica,I know...God.
3,Monica,I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since   I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos.
4,Monica,What happened to all   our money?
5,Chandler,"I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron."
6,Monica,"I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than   we're bringing in."
7,Chandler,Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
8,Monica,"Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love!"
9,Monica,I can't ask   you to give that up.
10,Monica,Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know...   finding gold.
11,Chandler,You know what?
12,Chandler,You know what?
13,Chandler,I think we're making too big a deal   out of this.
14,Chandler,ok?
15,Chandler,So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next   month we cut back on a few things.
16,Chandler,And maybe we start eating out of Joey's   refrigerator for a change.
17,Chandler,You're chef... what can you make out of backing   soda and beer?
18,Monica,Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
19,Chandler,No!
20,Chandler,We're not borrowing money.
21,Monica,Why not?
22,Chandler,Because we don't do that.
23,Chandler,We are Bings!
24,Chandler,And if there's one thing   my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool   house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
25,Monica,Wow!
26,Monica,I Had no idea you had this much pride.
27,Chandler,That's right!
28,Chandler,I do!
29,Chandler,And I'm your man.
30,Chandler,And I'm going to get us through   this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
31,Chandler,Opening Credits
32,Phoebe,Why?
33,Phoebe,"Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you."
34,Phoebe,I want you to stay.
35,Phoebe,Why don't you turn them inside ou...
36,Phoebe,I'll miss you.
37,Phoebe,Great!
38,Phoebe,Ok...I'll go get the tube top.
39,Phoebe,"Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say ""Hell   yeah!"""
40,Phoebe,Yeah!
41,Phoebe,Let's do it!
42,Phoebe,Let's live together!
43,Phoebe,"Oh god, we're really going to move in together!"
44,Phoebe,I've always wanted to live with a guy.
45,Phoebe,"""Pick up your socks!"""
46,Phoebe,"""Put   down the toilet seat!"""
47,Phoebe,"""No!"
48,Phoebe,"We're not having sex anymore!"""
49,Phoebe,It's   gonna be fun!
50,Monica,Hey Joey!
51,Joey,Hey!
52,Monica,"Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never   get back to Chandler."
53,Joey,I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself.
54,Joey,"Chandler is   my best friend, it would be wrong."
55,Joey,Good......But wrong.
56,Monica,Ok first of all...It would be great.
57,Monica,But that's   not what I'm here to talk to you about.
58,Monica,I need to borrow some money.
59,Joey,"Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always   a mistake."
60,Monica,But Chandler lent you money!
61,Joey,And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.
62,Monica,Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.
63,Joey,Oh...how much?
64,Monica,Two thousand dollars?
65,Joey,Two thousand dollars!?
66,Joey,What do you think I am?
67,Joey,I soap opera star!
68,Monica,Yeah...
69,Joey,That's right I am!
70,Rachel,Hi you guys!
71,Rachel,Joey &
72,Monica,Hey!
73,Joey,Oo...what's in the bag?
74,Rachel,Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling?
75,Rachel,"I realised that this   place, is very unsafe for a baby."
76,Rachel,So I went to the store and got some stuff   to baby-proof the apartment.
77,Joey,Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now?
78,Joey,"Y'know, when   I was a kid it was like.. ""Whoops!"
79,Joey,"Joey fell down the stairs!"""
80,Joey,"or   er.. ""Whoops!"
81,Joey,"Joey electrocuted himself again!"""
82,Joey,Huh!
83,Monica,"Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?"
84,Rachel,No.
85,Rachel,I was just going to do this myself.
86,Joey,You're gonna do it?
87,Rachel,"Yeah, Why?"
88,Rachel,You don't think a woman can do this?
89,Joey,"Oh, women can."
90,Joey,You can't.
91,Rachel,Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?
92,Monica,You're a pig.
93,Monica,And you can't do this.
94,Rachel,Wha!?
95,Rachel,What!?
96,Rachel,Come on!
97,Rachel,I found the hardware store all by myself!
98,Joey,The hardware store is right down the street.
99,Rachel,There is a hardware store right down the street?
100,Phoebe,Hey you guys!
101,Phoebe,"Ok, we've got great news."
102,Ross,Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
103,Phoebe,I know it's so exciting!
104,Phoebe,You know I've never lived with a guy before.
105,Monica,Well you know it's just like living with a girl.
106,Monica,Only they don't steal   your makeup.
107,Monica,"Unless they're playing ""This is what my sister would look   like"""
108,Chandler,Yeah.... she's not so cute.
109,Phoebe,"Okay, well you put down the toilet seat."
110,Monica,Is that a bit you guys do?
111,Phoebe,Uh huh...we're playing you two.
112,Monica,We don't do that!
113,Monica,Tell her we don't do that!
114,Chandler,Yes dear.
115,Ross,I can't believe you guys are moving in together.
116,Ross,"That's, that's great!"
117,Ross,I mean...I'm happy for you guys..
118,Monica,I hear wedding bells.
119,Phoebe,Monica slow down!
120,Phoebe,Ok?
121,Phoebe,I'm just excited to be living with him.
122,Phoebe,"You   know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike?"
123,Phoebe,Sure!
124,Phoebe,Yeah.
125,Phoebe,Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that   highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way.
126,Phoebe,But do I want that house   in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send   Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.
127,Ross,"Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional."
128,Phoebe,I know!
129,Phoebe,I guess I am!
130,Phoebe,Oh my god!
131,Phoebe,Load up the Volvo I want to be a   soccer mom!
132,Phoebe,Yeah!
133,Phoebe,You bet roomy!
134,Monica,Don't you mean..groomy?
135,Phoebe,"Oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have   us picking out china patterns."
136,Phoebe,China patterns!!!!
137,Rachel,This is easy...Can't do this!
138,Rachel,Oh!
139,Rachel,Wow!
140,Rachel,Seriously I can't do this.
141,Chandler,Hey Joe!
142,Joey,Hey!
143,Chandler,Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything   about it.
144,Joey,I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.
145,Chandler,And that would have made the official party line.
146,Chandler,Monica   and I are having a little financial trouble.
147,Joey,"Yeah, I know."
148,Chandler,What?
149,Chandler,What do you mean you know?
150,Joey,Err...
151,Joey,I just figured it out!
152,Joey,"You know, I mean you're not working and   the economy is bad."
153,Chandler,Oh!
154,Chandler,Right.
155,Joey,That's the fastest I have ever thought!
156,Chandler,"Anyway, err..."
157,Chandler,I need to borrow some money.
158,Joey,Oh!
159,Joey,Sure!
160,Joey,How much?
161,Joey,Two thousand dollars?
162,Chandler,Yes!
163,Chandler,Two thousand dollars exactly!
164,Chandler,How do you know that!
165,Joey,Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your   rent is.
166,Chandler,Oh ok.
167,Joey,I am on fire!
168,Joey,Chandler
169,Joey,Err... Kind of.
170,Chandler,I can't believe her!
171,Chandler,Did she tell you we were having money problems?
172,Joey,Oh no no no no no...
173,Joey,It wasn't...
174,Joey,"It wasn't because of your money problems,   it was for something for her."
175,Chandler,What?
176,Joey,Something personal.
177,Chandler,What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she   wouldn't tell me about?
178,Joey,Boob job.
179,Monica,I don't want her to get a boob job!
180,Monica,That's crazy!
181,Joey,Well it's...It's not that crazy okay?
182,Joey,"Making them smaller, that would   be crazy."
183,Phoebe,Oh!
184,Phoebe,Alright.
185,Phoebe,Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's   a play on the word roomy.
186,Phoebe,Oh no!
187,Phoebe,No no!
188,Phoebe,Not at all.
189,Phoebe,We're just moving in right now.
190,Phoebe,See where   it goes.
191,Phoebe,What do you mean?
192,Phoebe,Oh.
193,Phoebe,Wow.
194,Phoebe,Was it really that bad?
195,Phoebe,"Ok, well that's bad."
196,Phoebe,But don't you think it might be different with   someone else?
197,Phoebe,Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet.
198,Phoebe,Except for once in   the ocean.
199,Phoebe,But it's just...
200,Phoebe,Oh!
201,Phoebe,No!
202,Phoebe,I definitely don't wanna get married.
203,Phoebe,No I just wanted to make   sure you didn't want to too.
204,Phoebe,Whew!
205,Phoebe,Coz you know when we move in and you start   changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!
206,Phoebe,Yeah I get that.
207,Rachel,Hi!
208,Monica,So you gave in and decided to call someone?
209,Rachel,"Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding."
210,Rachel,I can barely use chopsticks.
211,Rachel,Oh thank you so much.
212,Rachel,Oh oh wait!
213,Rachel,You forgot your erm...Your game.
214,Chandler,Hey Rach!
215,Chandler,There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.
216,Rachel,Don't look at me I never get his jokes.
217,Monica,Thank you?
218,Chandler,Oh no..don't thank me.
219,Chandler,Thank you.
220,Chandler,You know there's not one thing   I would change about you?
221,Chandler,Not one single thing!
222,Chandler,And definitely not... two...   single things.
223,Monica,"Ok, you're being wierd."
224,Monica,Do you want sex or did you do something bad?
225,Chandler,No no!
226,Chandler,"I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form."
227,Monica,"Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice?"
228,Monica,They're still   ok.
229,Chandler,Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice.
230,Chandler,I want to compliment your body.
231,Chandler,I mean..I wouldn't change it.
232,Chandler,At all.
233,Chandler,"And more   specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger."
234,Monica,Okay...
235,Chandler,"I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would   you?"
236,Chandler,Don't answer that.
237,Rachel,Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.
238,Monica,I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
239,Rachel,I don't know!
240,Rachel,"I mean, what brought that on?"
241,Monica,Oh my god.
242,Monica,We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting   to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.
243,Rachel,No you really think that's what it is?
244,Monica,You heard him!
245,Monica,"""No bigger!"""
246,Monica,"""You're perfect!"""
247,Monica,"""Just   don't get any bigger!"""
248,Monica,Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling   coach.
249,Monica,You know what?
250,Monica,I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.
251,Rachel,Yeah!
252,Rachel,If you don't I will!
253,Rachel,Of course your body's gonna change.
254,Rachel,"Your   breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna lose   bladder control."
255,Rachel,God!
256,Rachel,It's just such a magical time!
257,Phoebe,Hi
258,Ross,Hey!
259,Phoebe,"Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage."
260,Ross,Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes?
261,Ross,I mean I can see for   all hanging out but to come to my home!
262,Phoebe,No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.
263,Ross,Why?
264,Phoebe,Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.
265,Ross,Never?
266,Phoebe,Never.
267,Ross,"wow, are you still going to move in with him?"
268,Phoebe,"I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really   that big a deal."
269,Phoebe,"You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything."
270,Phoebe,That marriage stinks!
271,Ross,"Yeah, marriage... stinks!"
272,Ross,I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight   and a woman stop shaving?
273,Ross,Get them married.
274,Phoebe,That's not how you really feel is it?
275,Ross,"No, I'm sorry."
276,Ross,Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now   but I can't help it.
277,Ross,I love marriage.
278,Phoebe,Seriously?
279,Phoebe,You divorce-o?
280,Ross,"If you have to call me name, I prefer ""Ross the Divorcer""."
281,Ross,It's just cooler.
282,Ross,"Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out."
283,Ross,But I love   to be that committed to another person.
284,Ross,And Carol had some good times before   she became a lesbian... and once afterward.
285,Ross,I'm sorry.
286,Phoebe,It's ok that's how you feel.
287,Ross,But come on!
288,Ross,I mean living together will be great!
289,Ross,I mean you guys have   so much fun and you love Mike.
290,Phoebe,I do love Mike.
291,Ross,Yeah see?
292,Ross,"And you are so excited about moving in together before, and   you know what?"
293,Ross,You should be.
294,Ross,It's a big deal!
295,Phoebe,Yeah I guess you're right.
296,Phoebe,Yeah thanks.
297,Phoebe,This helped.
298,Phoebe,Thanks.
299,Ross,"The Divorcer, to the rescue!"
300,Phoebe,It's not cooler.
301,Ross,Yeah I just hurt it.
302,Joey,Rach?!
303,Joey,Rachel!!!!?
304,Joey,So I can't do anything I like???
305,Chandler,Hey Rach!
306,Chandler,Ah........
307,Chandler,Perfection.
308,Chandler,Wouldn't change   a thing.
309,Chandler,Not a thing.
310,Monica,Honey?
311,Chandler,Yeah?
312,Monica,About that?
313,Monica,Erm...I'm going to change.
314,Chandler,But honey you don't have to.
315,Monica,I'm going to get bigger!
316,Chandler,Honey I...
317,Chandler,I love your breasts the way they are!
318,Rachel,Argh.
319,Rachel,fascist
320,Monica,"Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not!"
321,Monica,And you know what?
322,Monica,It's not just my breasts.
323,Monica,My ass is going to get bigger   too.
324,Chandler,your ass?!?!
325,Rachel,"Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!"
326,Chandler,They...do that?
327,Monica,It's kind of a package deal!
328,Chandler,God why why would you want to do that to yourself!
329,Monica,I thought I was something that we both wanted!
330,Chandler,"Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get   on more with the big boobs."
331,Chandler,But the giant ass and the big clown feet?
332,Rachel,Oh my god Chandler!
333,Rachel,"If you can't handle this, what are you going to   be like in the hospital?"
334,Rachel,With the blood and the screaming and the little present   that's shooting out of her!
335,Chandler,What?
336,Rachel,Joey!
337,Rachel,Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?
338,Joey,Because she is!
339,Monica,"Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money."
340,Joey,Mmmm hmm!
341,Joey,For your boob job!
342,Joey,"Monica, Rachel,"
343,Chandler,It's over/Joe!
344,Joey,OK so I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any   bigger?
345,Ross,Hey!
346,Ross,What do you guys think about this.
347,Ross,"""Ross"
348,Phoebe,Better.
349,Ross,"Hey Pheebs, you know I'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the   other day and I hope I was a little helpful."
350,Phoebe,Oh yeah you were helpful!
351,Phoebe,"Yeah, no, thanks you."
352,Ross,"Good, good."
353,Ross,"Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised   I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you."
354,Phoebe,What do you mean?
355,Ross,"Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in   the whole soccer mom thing?"
356,Ross,but is that really you?
357,Ross,I mean can you honestly   picture yourself in a Volvo?
358,Phoebe,They are awfully boxy...
359,Ross,I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage.
360,Ross,I mean it's so... normal.
361,Phoebe,Uh huh.
362,Ross,"Hey hey, can I help?"
363,Chandler,Well!
364,Chandler,"We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow   hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets   really tricky."
365,Ross,You know sometimes your words... they hurt.
366,Joey,"Hey uh, where do you guys want this?"
367,Rachel,"Yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy."
368,Rachel,"I   mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys."
369,Phoebe,Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle   room?
370,Phoebe,None at all?
371,Phoebe,Right.

373,Joey,Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?
374,Phoebe,Someday.
375,Chandler,Aaaaand....... hernia.
376,Phoebe,I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was   missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the   regular stuff.
377,Phoebe,Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it.
378,Phoebe,"And I love you, and   I wanted to live with you."
379,Phoebe,But I don't think I can!
380,Phoebe,"it was ok to move in when I didn't know what   was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen."
381,Phoebe,Are you gonna change yours?
382,Phoebe,Me neither.
383,Phoebe,I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.
384,Phoebe,I don't want it to end either.

29,Chandler,Oh my God.
30,Chandler,I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!
31,Chandler,Is it a vestibule?
32,Chandler,Maybe it's an atrium.
33,Chandler,"Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!"
34,Chandler,Jill says vestibule...
35,Chandler,I'm going with vestibule.
36,Chandler,Oh!
37,Chandler,Some guy.
38,Chandler,Some guy.
39,Chandler,"'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night."
40,Chandler,"Yes, he was some guy."
41,Joey,Hi everyone.
42,Ross,"And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani."
43,Joey,"Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so..."
44,Joey,"Happy Chanukah, everyone."
45,Phoebe,"Eww, look."
46,Phoebe,Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
47,Rachel,That had to hurt!
48,Chandler,"Alright, alright, alright."
49,Chandler,It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word.
50,Chandler,"Oh God, do something."
51,Chandler,"Just make contact, smile!"
52,Chandler,There you go!
53,Chandler,You're definitely scaring here.
54,Chandler,"Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with."
55,Chandler,"Yeah, thanks."
56,Monica,Hello?
57,Chandler,"Hey, it's me."
58,Monica,It's Chandler!
59,Monica,Are you OK?

62,Monica,What?
63,Chandler,I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!

65,Chandler,Put Joey on the phone.
66,Joey,What's up man?
67,Chandler,I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
68,Joey,Oh my God!
69,Joey,He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!
70,Joey,"Chandler, listen."
71,Chandler,"Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind."
72,Rachel,"Alright, somebody."
73,Monica,"OK, I'll go."
74,Monica,"OK, senior year of college... on a pool table."
75,Ross,That's my sister.
76,Joey,OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
77,Monica,Oh my God!
78,Monica,What were you doing in a library?
79,Ross,"Pheebs, what about you?"
80,Phoebe,Oh... Milwaukee.
81,Rachel,Um... Ross?
82,Ross,"Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'"
83,Ross,The ride broke down.
84,Ross,"So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom."
85,Phoebe,"Oh, Rachel."
86,Rachel,"Oh come on, I already went."
87,Monica,You did not go!
88,Rachel,"Oh, alright."
89,Rachel,"The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed."
90,Ross,Step back.
91,Joey,We have a winner!
92,Rachel,"I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park."
93,Ross,"Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line."
94,Rachel,"There, well, see?"
95,Rachel,Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
96,Ross,Come on.
97,Rachel,"No, he said we were holding up the people behind us."
98,Ross,And you didn't marry him because...?
99,Rachel,"I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of..."
100,Ross,Probably.
101,Ross,"But you know, I'll tell you something."
102,Ross,Passion is way overrated.
103,Rachel,Yeah right.
104,Ross,It is.
105,Ross,"Eventually, it kind of... burns out."
106,Ross,"But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism."
107,Ross,"So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff."
108,Rachel,OK.
109,Ross,"But, um..."
110,Ross,I don't think that's going to be you.
111,Rachel,You don't.
112,Ross,Uh-uh.
113,Ross,"See, I see.... big passion in your future."
114,Rachel,Really?
115,Ross,Mmmm.
116,Rachel,You do?
117,Ross,I do.
118,Rachel,"Oh Ross, you're so great."
119,Joey,It's never gonna happen.
120,Ross,What?
121,Joey,You and Rachel.
122,Ross,What?
123,Ross,Why not?
124,Joey,"Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone."
125,Ross,"No, no, no."
126,Ross,I'm not in the zone.
127,Joey,"Ross, you're mayor of the zone."
128,Ross,"I'm taking my time, alright?"
129,Ross,I'm laying the groundwork.
130,Ross,Yeah.
131,Ross,"I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to..."
132,Joey,Priesthood!
133,Joey,"Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking."
134,Joey,If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
135,Ross,"I will, I will."
136,Ross,"See, I'm waiting for the right moment."
137,Ross,What?
138,Ross,"What, now?"
139,Joey,Yeeeeaaaahhh!
140,Joey,What's messing you up?
141,Joey,The wine?
142,Joey,The candles?
143,Joey,The moonlight?
144,Joey,"You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...'"
145,Ross,Shhhh!
146,Rachel,What are you shushing?
147,Ross,We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something.
148,Ross,Listen.
149,Ross,Don't you hear that?
150,Rachel,Ahhhh!
151,Ross,See?
152,Rachel,Huh.
153,Chandler,"Um, is it sugarless?"
154,Chandler,"Oh, then no thanks."
155,Chandler,What the hell was that?
156,Chandler,Mental
157,Phoebe,"New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour."
158,Phoebe,"But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la..."
159,Ross,"OK, here goes."
160,Joey,Are you going to do it?
161,Ross,I'm going to do it.
162,Joey,Do you want any help?
163,Ross,"You come out there, you're a dead man."
164,Joey,"Good luck, man."
165,Ross,Thanks.
166,Ross,OK.
167,Joey,OK.
168,Joey,"Hey, where are you going?"
169,Monica,Outside.
170,Joey,You can't go out there.
171,Monica,Why not?
172,Joey,Because of... the reason.
173,Monica,And that would be?
174,Joey,"I, um, can't tell you."
175,Monica,"Joey, what's going on?"
176,Joey,"OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you."
177,Monica,About what?
178,Joey,He's planning your birthday party.
179,Monica,Oh my God!
180,Monica,I love him!
181,Joey,You'd better act surprised.
182,Phoebe,About what?
183,Monica,My surprise party!
184,Phoebe,What surprise party?
185,Monica,Oh stop it.
186,Monica,Joey already told me.
187,Phoebe,"Well, he didn't tell me."
188,Joey,"Hey, don't look at me."
189,Joey,This is Ross's thing.
190,Phoebe,This is so typical.
191,Phoebe,I'm always the last one to know everything.
192,Monica,"No, you are not."
193,Monica,We tell you stuff.
194,Phoebe,Yuh-huh!
195,Phoebe,I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo.
196,Phoebe,I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.
197,Phoebe,Looks like I was second to last.
198,Rachel,Hmmm... this is so nice.
199,Ross,"OK, I have a question."
200,Ross,"Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment."
201,Rachel,OK.
202,Ross,OK.
203,Ross,Here goes.
204,Ross,"For a while now, I've been wanting to, um...."
205,Rachel,Ohhh!!!
206,Ross,"Yes, yes, that's right..."
207,Rachel,"Oh, look at the little cat!"
208,Ross,What?
209,Ross,Ow!

211,Phoebe,"I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since... Commercial Break"
212,Monica,This is just Bactine.
213,Monica,It won't hurt.
214,Joey,"Sorry, that was wax."
215,Phoebe,"Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death."
216,Phoebe,We should find his owner.
217,Ross,Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
218,Rachel,During a blackout?
219,Rachel,He'd get trampled!
220,Ross,Yeah?
221,Chandler,"You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection."
222,Chandler,'Gum would be perfection'?
223,Chandler,'Gum would be perfection.'
224,Chandler,"Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no."
225,Chandler,"For me, gum is perfection."
226,Chandler,I loathe myself.
227,Phoebe,"Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?"
228,Rachel,Oh.
229,Rachel,Hi.
230,Rachel,We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
231,Rachel,Mr.
232,Phoebe,He seems to hate you.
233,Phoebe,Are you sure?
234,Phoebe,Mr.
235,Phoebe,Wait a minute.
236,Phoebe,What's his name?
237,Phoebe,Mr.
238,Rachel,Bob Buttons?
239,Rachel,Mr.
240,Phoebe,Oooh!
241,Phoebe,You are a very bad man!
242,Phoebe,Mr.
243,Rachel,"Here, kitty-kitty."
244,Rachel,Here kitty-kitty.
245,Rachel,"Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty?"
246,Rachel,Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...
247,Rachel,Wow.
248,Ross,Lucky sixes....
249,Rachel,"Everybody, this is Paolo."
250,Rachel,"Paolo, I want you to meet my friends."
251,Rachel,This is Monica.
252,Monica,Hi!
253,Rachel,And Joey....
254,Monica,Hi!
255,Rachel,And Ross.
256,Monica,Hi!
257,Rachel,He doesn't speak much English.
258,Rachel,Look at that!
259,Ross,"So, um... where did Paolo come from?"
260,Rachel,"Oh... Italy, I think."
261,Ross,"No, I mean tonight, in the building."
262,Ross,Suddenly.
263,Ross,Into our lives.
264,Rachel,"Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!"
265,Ross,"That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him."
266,Phoebe,Alright.
267,Phoebe,I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
268,Rachel,"Oh, I found him."
269,Rachel,He was Paolo's cat.
270,Phoebe,Ah!
271,Phoebe,Well!
272,Phoebe,There you go!
273,Phoebe,Last to know again!
274,Phoebe,And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
275,Rachel,"Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe."
276,Phoebe,You betcha!
277,Chandler,"Ah, let's see."
278,Chandler,What next?
279,Chandler,Blow a bubble.
280,Chandler,A bubble's good.
281,Chandler,"It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish."
282,Chandler,Here we go.
283,Chandler,"Nice going, imp."
284,Chandler,"OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth."
285,Chandler,Good save!
286,Chandler,"We're back on track, and I'm...  ..chewing someone else's gum."
287,Chandler,This is not my gum.
288,Chandler,Oh my God!
289,Chandler,Oh my God!
290,Chandler,And now you're choking.
291,Chandler,Yes... thank you.
292,Chandler,That was... that was....
293,Ross,"Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah...."
294,Ross,Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
295,Rachel,I have absolutely no idea.
296,Ross,That's... that's classic.
297,Rachel,"Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing?"
298,Rachel,What am I doing?
299,Rachel,This is so un-me!
300,Monica,"If you want, I'll do it."
301,Phoebe,"I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip."
302,Phoebe,But I won't.
303,Rachel,"God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry."
304,Phoebe,"You know, did you ride mopeds?"
305,Phoebe,"'Cause I've heard... ... oh, I see... it's not about that right now."
306,Phoebe,OK.
307,Rachel,"Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd...."
308,Ross,Paolo.
309,Ross,Hi.
310,Ross,Listen.
311,Ross,"Um, listen."
312,Ross,"Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing."
313,Ross,"Thing, yes."
314,Ross,Thing.
315,Ross,"No, no, no."
316,Ross,"Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point."
317,Ross,"See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together."
318,Ross,"You know, and if you get in the.... um..."
319,Ross,"No, no, that's not where I was going."
320,Ross,"Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad."
321,Ross,Yeah!
322,Ross,Se vice?
323,Ross,So you do know a little English.
324,Ross,Do you know the word crapweasel?
325,Ross,"That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!"
326,Chandler,OK.

60,Phoebe,Monica!
61,Phoebe,That's not right!
62,Phoebe,Start with where.
63,Rachel,"Well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home from work and Ross was already there cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey."
64,Joey,You're welcome buddy.
65,Ross,"Yeah, thanks."
66,Rachel,"And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered to help me out."
67,Rachel,"And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me."
68,Ross,Umm that'sthat's a little misleading.
69,Rachel,What is?
70,Ross,The lie you just told.
71,Rachel,That-that you came on to me?
72,Ross,There's the one!
73,Rachel,But you did!
74,Rachel,"I mean, let's be honest."
75,Ross,Yes let's.
76,Ross,Y'know what?

91,Ross,Y'know what?!
92,Ross,It doesn't matter!
93,Ross,It doesn't matter what you believe!
94,Ross,What matters is what happened!
95,Rachel,Okay.
96,Rachel,"So these signals Ross, explain this to me, cause maybe I need to be more careful."
97,Rachel,"I mean, am I sending you these signals right now?"
98,Ross,Y'know what?
99,Ross,Y'know what?

119,Joey,You get food poisoning just talkin' to that place.
120,Monica,"Uh sorry, wrong number."
121,Chandler,Here you go.
122,Monica,Hello?
123,Monica,It's the deli again!
124,Joey,All right!
125,Joey,I'll have a sandwich!
126,Monica,I don't think this number's right!
127,Chandler,What?
128,Phoebe,You got fake numbered.
129,Monica,What?!
130,Monica,People don't do that!
131,Joey,Oh I think we do.
132,Monica,They gave us a fake number?
133,Monica,Why?
134,Monica,Why would they do that?
135,Chandler,I don't know!
136,Chandler,You were a delight to talk to.
137,Chandler,"You asked all those insightful, great questions."
138,Monica,And you've never been funnier.
139,Monica,"Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot!"
140,Joey,Y'know what?
141,Joey,"Don't worry about it, you still got me and Phoebe."
142,Phoebe,"Excuse me, I don't want Greg and Jenny's rejects."
143,Ross,Rachel won't talk to me!
144,Ross,She won't even open the door!
145,Phoebe,"Hmm, I wonder why."
146,Phoebe,Pervert!
147,Ross,"Okay, listen I am not a pervert!"
148,Phoebe,That's like the pervert motto!
149,Phoebe,Yeah!
150,Phoebe,Yeah!
151,Phoebe,"They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!"
152,Ross,Filming Rachel is not something I planned.
153,Ross,"Okay look, here's what happened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this."
154,Ross,"All right, about-about a month and a half ago I came to you with a problem?"
155,Ross,"Umm, a personal thing."
156,Joey,Personal thing?
157,Joey,What personal thing?
158,Joey,I don't know.
159,Ross,Aboutabout sex?
160,Ross,That I hadn't had sex in months?
161,Joey,Yeah I knew what you were talkin' about.
162,Joey,Six Weeks Earlier
163,Ross,Hey!
164,Joey,Hey.
165,Ross,Do you have a minute?
166,Ross,"I'd like to talk to you about something I'm, I'm really uncomfortable talking about."
167,Joey,Sure.
168,Joey,What?
169,Joey,"About uh, you showering with your mom?"
170,Ross,I actually had a topic in mind!
171,Ross,"I'm, I'm kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise."
172,Joey,"Whoa, for like months?"
173,Ross,"Five to be lying, six."
174,Joey,Six months?
175,Joey,Whoa that's rough.
176,Ross,"Well, I mean it's not all bad."
177,Ross,"I'm learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life."
178,Ross,Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.
179,Joey,The sky's blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!
180,Ross,"Please, help me!"
181,Ross,I have a date tonight.
182,Ross,It has to go well okayI'm scared for my health!
183,Joey,Okay.
184,Joey,Okay.
185,Joey,UmmOoh!
186,Joey,"Oh-oh, I got something."
187,Joey,"It's this story I came up with, very romantic."
188,Joey,I swear any woman that hears it; they're like putty.
189,Ross,Really?
190,Ross,Well then tell it to me.
191,Joey,Okay.
192,Joey,"Now you're gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story."
193,Ross,I'll try to control myself.
194,Joey,Okay.
195,Joey,"Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe"
196,Ross,You were backpacking across Western Europe?
197,Joey,Have a nice six more months Ross!
198,Ross,Okay!
199,Ross,Okay!
200,Ross,Okay.
201,Ross,I'm sorry.
202,Ross,"Please, please, you were in Western Europe and?"
203,Joey,I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo.
204,Joey,"I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded."
205,Joey,And there were tall trees all around.
206,Joey,It was dead silent.
207,Joey,Gorgeous.
208,Joey,And across the lake I sawa beautiful womanbathing herselfbut she was crying
209,Ross,Why?
210,Ross,It's from FranceIn EuropeWestern Europe.
211,Ross,"Y'know umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe."
212,Ross,Uh-hmmWait!
213,Ross,It gets better.
214,Ross,"Um, yeah I was in Barcelona."
215,Ross,"Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking"
216,Ross,Oh that's great!

221,Joey,What are you doing here?
222,Joey,How did your date go?
223,Ross,Great!
224,Ross,I'm across the street having sex with her right now.
225,Ross,Your story sucks!
226,Joey,Hey!
227,Joey,"Look, if it didn't work it's because you didn't tell it right!"
228,Joey,Show me how you did it.
229,Ross,No!
230,Ross,"No, I don'tdon't want to."
231,Joey,How long since you've seen a girl naked?
232,Ross,I was backpacking across Western Europe.
233,Joey,I'm not feeling it.
234,Ross,"I was just outside Barcelona, hiking"
235,Joey,No!
236,Joey,No!
237,Joey,No Ross!
238,Joey,I'm not hot!
239,Joey,Are you hot?
240,Ross,It's been six months!
241,Ross,I'm always hot!
242,Joey,Well you're not selling the story!
243,Joey,It's like; it's like you don't believe it!
244,Joey,"Look, I gotta go."
245,Joey,"I got a date, but try this."
246,Joey,Do what I do when I'm preparing for an audition.
247,Joey,Okay?
248,Joey,I'll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what you're doing wrong.
249,Ross,I'll try that.
250,Joey,"All right now All right, you're all set up."
251,Joey,You're good to go.
252,Joey,Just hit record.
253,Joey,All right?
254,Ross,Thanks.
255,Joey,Good luck.
256,Ross,Thanks.
257,Ross,And-and hey Joe?
258,Joey,Yeah?
259,Ross,"Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I'll help you out."
260,Joey,That means a lot to me man.
261,Ross,Hello!
262,Ross,Can I get you anything?
263,Ross,Huh?
264,Ross,Lens cleaner?
265,Ross,Your battery okay?
266,Ross,Rachel!
267,Rachel,Oh Ross!
268,Ross,Hi!
269,Rachel,Thank God you're here!
270,Rachel,You have to help me!
271,Rachel,Were you just talking to yourself?
272,Ross,"That's less embarrassing, yes."
273,Ross,Yes I was.
274,Ross,"So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera."
275,Ross,It kept rolling and recorded everything.
276,Chandler,"Yeah, we're gonna need to see that tape."
277,Monica,"Yeah, definitely."
278,Ross,What a great idea!
279,Ross,That will get Rachel to forgive me!
280,Joey,Y'know what?
281,Joey,This is not fair to her.
282,Joey,Let's just forget the tape!
283,Ross,Thank you.
284,Ross,No!
285,Joey,You're right.
286,Ross,Joey!
287,Ross,No!
288,Joey,Loud and clear!
289,Monica,I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.
290,Joey,"Y'know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn't give you real names either."
291,Monica,"Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don't give out fake names."
292,Joey,Oh yeah?
293,Joey,"Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you."
294,Phoebe,Regina Philange.
295,Chandler,"I still don't get it, we didn't do anything wrong."
296,Monica,I know!
297,Monica,"Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes."
298,Chandler,I thought you said those jokes were funny.
299,Chandler,Joke!
300,Chandler,Joke!
301,Chandler,Joke!
302,Monica,Joke.
303,Monica,Joke.
304,Monica,Blah!
305,Monica,Blah!
306,Chandler,Well maybe it was all of your questions.
307,Monica,What about my questions?
308,Chandler,"The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!"
309,Monica,"Oh, I'm sorry."
310,Monica,Was that another joke?
311,Chandler,Was that another question?
312,Rachel,Hey!
313,Rachel,Is Ross still here?
314,Joey,"Uh no Rach, he's gone."
315,Joey,"But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake."
316,Rachel,Oh really?
317,Rachel,Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it?
318,Rachel,Oh forget it!
319,Rachel,"Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village."
320,Ross,"Look, it was accident!"
321,Ross,Okay?
322,Ross,"I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didn't even watch it!"
323,Ross,"Anyway, here."
324,Ross,I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself.
325,Rachel,Thank you.
326,Rachel,What?
327,Rachel,You don't want to see this do you?
328,Monica,Hell yeah!!
329,Rachel,I am not gonna show you this!
330,Phoebe,No!
331,Phoebe,"Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it."
332,Ross,"Forget it, she's destroying it."
333,Phoebe,Okay fine!
334,Phoebe,Fine!
335,Phoebe,"We'll just have to think of some other way to put the whole Who came onto who,' thing to rest!"
336,Phoebe,"Come on now, think!"
337,Ross,"Look, forget it Phoebe."
338,Ross,Okay?
339,Ross,It's Rachel's tape and she can do whatever she wants with it.
340,Ross,And she wants to destroy it.
341,Ross,"So, end of story."
342,Rachel,I wanna see it.
343,Ross,What?
344,Rachel,Clearly you don't want people to see this tape.
345,Rachel,"Now I don't want people to see this tape either, but you so badly don't people to see it makes me want to see it."
346,Rachel,You see?
347,Joey,Are we watchin' the tape or not?
348,Ross,I don't want people to see it for your sake.
349,Rachel,"Ahh, I don't believe you."
350,Rachel,I think you don't want them to see you begging me.
351,Ross,"Rachel, please"
352,Rachel,"Ah, a little preview!"
353,Ross,Fine.
354,Ross,"Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road, because in about five minutes I'm gonna be saying"
355,Rachel,"Okay, here we go."
356,Ross,Hello!
357,Ross,Can I get you anything?
358,Joey,I'm so happy!
359,Joey,Commercial Break
360,Rachel,"Oh, thank God you're here!"
361,Rachel,You have to help me!
362,Rachel,Were you just talking to yourself?
363,Rachel,There I am.
364,Phoebe,You're gonna get pregnant.
365,Rachel,"I screwed up so bad, I told Monica that I would stuff and send all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and I-I"
366,Ross,You didn't do it?
367,Rachel,I-I knowI had put them inin-in my desk at work and I completely forgot about them until today.
368,Monica,Sweetie okay.
369,Monica,It's okay.
370,Monica,Everybody made it to the wedding.
371,Monica,I'm fine.
372,Rachel,Kinda hurtin' my hand though.
373,Monica,I know.
374,Rachel,I cannot believe that I did this.
375,Rachel,Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it!
376,Rachel,"""Okay Rachel!"
377,Rachel,Here are the invitations Rachel!
378,Rachel,Now be very careful Rachel!
379,Rachel,"Please, drinking no liquids around the invitations Rachel!"""
380,Rachel,Whoa oh!
381,Rachel,Oh-oh-oh!
382,Rachel,Ohoh-oh-oh
383,Chandler,Did you do it on our invitations?
384,Ross,Not on the ones we sent out.
385,Chandler,"So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed!"
386,Rachel,Can you believe this is already happening?
387,Rachel,I mean it seems like yesterday they just got engaged.
388,Ross,I know.
389,Ross,Hey rememberremember the night they got engaged?
390,Ross,"How uh, you and I almost"
391,Rachel,"Oh, I remember how we almost."
392,Rachel,Do you think we would've gone through with it?
393,Rachel,"Y'know, if we hadn't gotten caught."
394,Rachel,Do you think we would've done it?
395,Ross,I mean II know I wanted to.
396,Ross,"I just, I just wasn't sure if you wanted to."
397,Rachel,Oh I wanted to.
398,Ross,So wewe both wanted to.
399,Rachel,Interesting.
400,Ross,Yeah.
401,Ross,"Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best."
402,Rachel,"Oh yeah, sure."
403,Rachel,"Okay, in about ten seconds you're gonna see him kiss me."
404,Ross,And in about five seconds you're gonna see why.
405,Rachel,Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe?
406,Rachel,"Okay, get ready to see some beggin'!"
407,Phoebe,"Oh, you came on to Ross!"
408,Rachel,What?
409,Ross,Now I'm so happy.
410,Rachel,What are you talking about?
411,Monica,You used the Europe story!
412,Chandler,That's the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!
413,Rachel,How do you know about that story?
414,Joey,How do you know about that story?
415,Rachel,I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!
416,Joey,Some guy!
417,Rachel,No.
418,Rachel,"No, she told me his name was Ken Adams."
419,Joey,Ken Adams!
420,Ross,Hi.
421,Rachel,"So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?"
422,Ross,Yeah.
423,Ross,"Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesn't matter."
424,Ross,"I mean, I think it would've happened either way."
425,Ross,I mean if you hadn't initiated it I-I-I know I would've.
426,Rachel,It was an amazing night.
427,Ross,It was.
428,Ross,It was an amazing night.
429,Rachel,You think it looked amazing?

432,Rachel,"Yeah, me neither."

25,Rachel,Yeah!
26,Rachel,Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around
27,Phoebe,All right.
28,Phoebe,"I'm gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I'm ready to have Frank and Alice's embryo transferred into my uterus."

191,Joey,That's your move?
192,Joey,"Boy Rach, you're lucky you're hot."
193,Rachel,"Come on, just answer the question!"
194,Joey,Queens.
195,Rachel,And so were-were you close to your parents?
196,Joey,"Yeah, with my mom."
197,Joey,"Yeah, not so much with my dad."
198,Rachel,Why not?
199,Joey,I don't know.
200,Joey,"I guess there's just always been this distance  y'knowI mean we both try to pretend it's not there, but it is."
201,Rachel,Oh.
202,Rachel,It's  gotta be rough.
203,Joey,"Yeah, it is."
204,Joey,It's really tough.
205,Joey,Y'know sometimes I  thinkWow!!
206,Joey,Nice move!
207,Rachel,Huh?
208,Joey,"""Where'd you grow up,"" it's so simple!"
209,Rachel,Thank you!
210,Rachel,"And now if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the rest  room."
211,Joey,Yeah.
212,Rachel,And now you're watching me walk away.
213,Joey,Yes I am!
214,Joey,Again so simple!
215,Monica,Hey.
216,Chandler,You are not going to believe what I did today!
217,Monica,Well it clearly wasn't showering or shaving.
218,Chandler,I got good.
219,Chandler,I played this game all day and now I rule at it!
220,Chandler,They  should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler.
221,Chandler,Although I-I hope they don't.
222,Monica,"Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man  while I went off to work like some kind of chump?"
223,Chandler,"Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the  board!"
224,Chandler,High five!
225,Monica,What is the matter with your hand?
226,Chandler,"Well I've been playing it for like eight hours, it'll loosen  up."
227,Chandler,"Come on, check out the scores."
228,Chandler,"Oh, and also look at the initials, they're dirty  words."
229,Monica,"Chandler, why would you do that?"
230,Chandler,Because it's awesome.
231,Monica,You think this is clever?
232,Chandler,"Well y'know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it  is a bit of a challenge."
233,Monica,"Hey wait a minute, this one isn't dirty."
234,Chandler,It is when you put it together with that one.
235,Monica,"Ah, well if you don't clear this off, you won't be getting one  of those from me."
236,Monica,"But Ben's coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this  can't be there."
237,Chandler,"Come on, he won't even know what they mean."
238,Monica,Chandler!
239,Monica,He's seven; he's not stupid.
240,Chandler,Have you talked to him lately?
241,Monica,"All right, look I'm just gonna unplug it."
242,Chandler,"No-no-no, if you unplug it, I'll have nothing to show for my day!"
243,Chandler,It would be like I was at work.
244,Chandler,No!
245,Chandler,Hey look at  that!
246,Chandler,"Look at that, it's still there!"
247,Chandler,This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM   Chip in it or something!
248,Monica,Honey you-you got to beat your scores!
249,Chandler,With the claw?
250,Monica,All right fine.
251,Monica,"Fine, I'll do it."
252,Monica,I've just got to get this  off the screen.
253,Monica,Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.
254,Chandler,Pull my fingerMy hand is  messed up.
255,Rachel,I am not gonna answer that!
256,Joey,Oh come on!
257,Joey,Just pick one!
258,Joey,"Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if  you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?"
259,Rachel,No one!
260,Rachel,"They are my friends, I wouldn't punch any of them."
261,Joey,Chandler?
262,Rachel,"Yeah, but I don't know why."
263,Rachel,"Look at me, I'm having such a  wonderful time!"
264,Joey,Me too!
265,Joey,"Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!"
266,Rachel,I know!
267,Joey,I never laughed so hardDid you see the wine come out of my nose?
268,Rachel,"Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose."
269,Joey,"I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so  much."
270,Rachel,Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.
271,Joey,Huh.
272,Joey,Huh.
273,Rachel,"All right, now don't judge me."
274,Rachel,"I normally wait until my date  leaves, but you live here."
275,Rachel,I'm ripping into this swan.
276,Joey,Ah!
277,Joey,"Okay, well then you don't judge me."
278,Joey,I'm gonna suck on the  cellophane from the brownie I had before.
279,Rachel,"So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani's end of the night moves?"
280,Joey,"Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips  look irresistible."
281,Rachel,How do you do that?
282,Joey,"Now you can't tell anyone, but uhI put on shiny lip balm."
283,Rachel,Oh my God!
284,Joey,"Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I'm telling ya."
285,Joey,"Okay all right, so now  you go."
286,Rachel,"No, I don't want to tell you."
287,Joey,Why not?
288,Rachel,Because it's embarrassing.
289,Joey,More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?!
290,Joey,I didn't say raspberry before did I?
291,Joey,"All right just-just tell me Rach, just  tell me!"
292,Rachel,Okay.
293,Rachel,"All right, stand up."
294,Rachel,"Well, when we're  at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a  second, and then I make this sound, ""Hmmm."""
295,Rachel,"Okay, I know it doesn't sound  like anything, but I swear it works."
296,Joey,Yeah.
297,Joey,"WhyYeah, that would work for ya"
298,Rachel,"All right, I gotta go to bed."
299,Rachel,"Honey, I had such a wonderful time."
300,Joey,Oh.
301,Joey,Yeah.
302,Joey,Me to.
303,Joey,Commercial Break
304,Rachel,"you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?"
305,Ross,"No, I ran."
306,Ross,"It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the  phrase, ""Get the hell out of my way!"""
307,Rachel,"Well, why didn't you just take a cab?"
308,Ross,"Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets  it'll take me twice as long."
309,Ross,"Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I?"
310,Ross,Rockefeller?
311,Rachel,Well you're not gonna be able to keep doing this.
312,Ross,Well I have to.
313,Ross,Okay?
314,Ross,"If I don't, they'll take the class away  from me."
315,Ross,AndI already put it in my family newsletter.
316,Rachel,You what?
317,Ross,"You've seen it, the Geller Yeller."
318,Rachel,Right.
319,Rachel,Wow!
320,Ross,"Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, I'm sure I can  make it this time."
321,Ross,I justI just can't be afraid to get a little bithit by  cars.
322,Joey,Hey!
323,Rachel,Hi!
324,Rachel,"Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo?"
325,Joey,"Oh yeah, I still can't believe you haven't seen Cujo."
326,Joey,What is wrong with you?
327,Rachel,Relax!
328,Rachel,It's not like it's Citizen Kane!
329,Joey,Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?
330,Rachel,"Yeah I know it's really boring, but it's like a big deal."
331,Rachel,"Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime."
332,Joey,Oh yeah?
333,Joey,"All right, let's do it tonight."
334,Rachel,Well don't you have that big date tonight?
335,Joey,Oh right!
336,Rachel,"Hey Joey, can I ask you something?"
337,Joey,Yeah.
338,Rachel,"After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?"
339,Joey,Oh my God!
340,Joey,You did too?
341,Joey,"It totally freaked me out, what was that?"
342,Rachel,I don't know!
343,Rachel,I'm-I'm kinda thinking it-it was  the lobster
344,Joey,"Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster."
345,Rachel,"Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night."
346,Joey,"Yeah me too, all night."
347,Rachel,Really?!
348,Rachel,How come we didn't cross paths?
349,Joey,Yeah well that's because uhI stayed in my room.
350,Joey,"Yeah, you  don't want to look in my hamper."
351,Monica,"Okay, I got that."
352,Monica,I'll escape over there.
353,Monica,I'll come back over  here.
354,Monica,"All right, come on Ms. Pac-Man."
355,Monica,"It's gotRight  Well, you're just a little bitch, aren't you?"
356,Phoebe,"Hey, you guys."
357,Phoebe,"Listen, I'm sorry that I was hogging the  game beforeOh my God!"
358,Phoebe,Your friends have some  unfortunate initials!
359,Monica,They're all Chandler.
360,Phoebe,Chandler sucks!
361,Phoebe,He couldn't have gotten this good!
362,Chandler,I did.
363,Chandler,But it came at a price.
364,Monica,But Ben is coming over tonight and he can't see this.
365,Chandler,"Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies."
366,Chandler,Was it just me?
367,Ross,Yeah!!!!
368,Ross,"Yes, I made it!"
369,Ross,I'm on time!
370,Ross,"Okay,  why don't we all uh,  open our books to page 23."
371,Ross,Where  Where you will seea uha bunch of uhred spots.
372,Ross,"Okay,  umm, why don't, why don't you all start to read, while I"
373,Joey,No-no!
374,Joey,I'm fine.
375,Joey,"It's just Hey, can I ask you something?"
376,Joey,Have you ever looked at someone that you've known for a while and then  suddenlysuddenly see them a different way?
377,Joey,Joey's
378,Joey,Yeah.
379,Joey,"Yeah, thatthat's exactly it."
380,Joey,You're right.
381,Joey,Yeah.
382,Joey,Joey's
383,Joey,Ooh!
384,Joey,Yeah.
385,Joey,"So yeah, so you know exactly what I'm talking  about."
386,Joey,Joey's
387,Joey,"Oh yeah, sure."
388,Joey,Ehhh.
389,Monica,"Oh my God Phoebe, you're on fire!"
390,Phoebe,I know!
391,Chandler,One more score to go!
392,Chandler,You can do it!
393,Phoebe,Don't touch me!
394,Monica,Don't touch her!
395,Chandler,All right!
396,Chandler,Go left!
397,Chandler,Go left!
398,Chandler,Go right!!
399,Chandler,Go right!
400,Phoebe,I can't!!

402,Phoebe,Noooooooo!!!!!!!
403,Phoebe,You son of a  bitch!!!!
404,Ross,Phoebe!
405,Phoebe,Oh hi BenNo!!
406,Phoebe,Don't look at the machine!
407,Rachel,Oh God!
408,Rachel,Thank God you're home!
409,Rachel,I'm watching Cujo.
410,Joey,Alone?
411,Rachel,Yes!
412,Rachel,But what is wrong with this dog?
413,Joey,"Hey, did you get to the part where they're trapped in the car and  Cujo's throwin' himself at the windshield?"
414,Rachel,No!
415,Rachel,No!
416,Rachel,"Seriously, what's wrong with the dog?!"
417,Rachel,"Wait a minute, what  are you doing home so early?"
418,Rachel,What happened to your date?
419,Joey,"Oh uh, it didn't work out."
420,Rachel,Oh.
421,Rachel,Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?
422,Joey,"Oh uh, okay."
423,Joey,Yeah.
424,Rachel,"Y'know, I never thought I'd say this about a movie, but I  really hope this dog dies."
425,Rachel,What are you doing over there?
426,Rachel,"Come sit here, you protect  me."
427,Joey,"Oh sure, yeah, why not?"
428,Rachel,Okay.
429,Rachel,"Okay, that's him!"
430,Rachel,That's him!
431,Rachel,That's  Cujo!
432,Rachel,That's Cujo!
433,Joey,"All right, I know!"
434,Joey,I know.
435,Joey,"Yeah, it'll be okay."
436,Rachel,Oh my God.What's he gonna do now?
437,Rachel,I can't watch!
438,Rachel,Oh.
439,Rachel,"Seriously, how can you watch this?"
440,Rachel,Aren't you scared?
441,Joey,Terrified.
442,Joey,Closing Credits
443,Ross,So is everybody here?
444,Ross,I got here a little early myself.
445,Ross,Let us begin.
446,Ross,"Now,  the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations."
447,Ross,Here.
448,Ross,Here.
449,Ross,Now as for the hydrosaurs   End
0,Phoebe,Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
1,Monica,Why?
2,Phoebe,"Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right."
3,Monica,Oh my God.
4,Monica,Phoebe.
5,Monica,"Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression."
6,Phoebe,Where?
7,Phoebe,"Ooh, come to Momma."
8,Monica,He's coming.
9,Monica,"Be cool, be cool, be cool."
10,Phoebe,Thanks.
11,Phoebe,We should do something.
12,Phoebe,Whistle.
13,Monica,We are not going to whistle.
14,Phoebe,"Come on, do it."
15,Monica,No!
16,Phoebe,Do it!
17,Monica,No!
18,Phoebe,Do it do it do it!
19,Monica,Woo-woo!
20,Phoebe,I can't believe you did that!
21,Phoebe,Opening Credits
22,Monica,Why did I 'woo-hoo'?
23,Monica,"I mean, what was I hoping would happen?"
24,Monica,"That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?"
25,Phoebe,I just wish there was something we could do.
26,Phoebe,Hello.
27,Phoebe,"Hello, Coma Guy."
28,Phoebe,"GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT!"
29,Phoebe,UP!
30,Phoebe,UP!
31,Phoebe,UP!
32,Monica,"Phoebe, what are you doing?"
33,Phoebe,Maybe nobody's tried this.
34,Monica,I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face.
35,Monica,"I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart."
36,Monica,I bet he's a lawyer.
37,Phoebe,"Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles?"
38,Phoebe,That means he's artistic.
39,Monica,"Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side."
40,Monica,And- he can dance!
41,Phoebe,Oh!
42,Phoebe,"And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked."
43,Monica,I wish all guys could be like him.
44,Phoebe,I know.
45,Chandler,Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
46,Monica,He doesn't have anyone.
47,Phoebe,"Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible."
48,Joey,I can't believe you said woowoo.
49,Joey,I don't even say woowoo.
50,Rachel,"Oh, she's coming up!"
51,Rachel,She's coming up!
52,Rachel,Jay
53,Chandler,"Y'know, we don't have to watch this."
54,Chandler,"Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax."
55,Rachel,"No way, forget it."
56,Joey,"C'mon, she's your mom!"
57,Chandler,Exactly.
58,Chandler,Weekend At Bernie's!
59,Chandler,"Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times!"
60,Chandler,No?
61,Rachel,"Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books!"
62,Rachel,I love her books!
63,Rachel,I cannot get on a plane without one!
64,Rachel,"I mean, this is so cool!"
65,Chandler,"Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'"
66,Ross,"C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom."
67,Ross,I think she's a blast.
68,Chandler,You can say that because she's not your mom.
69,Ross,"Oh, please..."
70,Rachel,"Oh, hi sweetie."
71,Ross,When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
72,Monica,Last night.
73,Ross,"Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?..."
74,Ross,"Just a dream I had- but, phew."
75,Phoebe,Hey hey hey!
76,Phoebe,She's on!
77,Phoebe,Your mom was arrested?
78,Chandler,"Shhh, busy beaming with pride."
79,Chandler,Mrs.
80,Chandler,Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
81,Chandler,THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
82,Chandler,Jay
83,Chandler,This is the way that I find out.
84,Chandler,Most moms use the phone.
85,Chandler,Jay
86,Chandler,...And then he burst into flames.
87,Monica,Let's see.
88,Monica,"Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports."
89,Phoebe,What about Glen?
90,Phoebe,He could be a Glen.
91,Monica,Nah... not-not special enough.
92,Phoebe,Ooh!
93,Phoebe,How about Agamemnon?
94,Monica,Waaay too special.
95,Chandler,Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
96,Chandler,Mrs.
97,Chandler,"Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little."
98,Ross,What is this dive?
99,Ross,Only you could've picked this place.
100,Ross,Mrs.
101,Chandler,I know I am.
102,Chandler,Mrs.
103,Monica,Yeah.
104,Phoebe,I'm in.
105,Phoebe,Mrs.
106,Ross,"Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy."
107,Rachel,Hi!
108,Rachel,"Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time."
109,Ross,...But a man can change.
110,Ross,Anyone want me to appraise anything?
111,Rachel,"Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written."
112,Rachel,"No, I mean it!"
113,Rachel,"I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer."
114,Rachel,Mrs.
115,Chandler,"Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen."
116,Chandler,Mrs.
117,Ross,"Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine."
118,Ross,Mrs.
119,Ross,Nothing.
120,Ross,Nothing nothing nothing.
121,Ross,Mrs.
122,Ross,No.
123,Ross,It's the one he's licking.
124,Ross,Mrs.
125,Ross,You're good.
126,Ross,Mrs.
127,Ross,The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
128,Ross,Mrs.
129,Ross,When?
130,Ross,Mrs.
131,Ross,The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
132,Ross,Mrs.
133,Ross,Please.
134,Ross,Mrs.
135,Ross,Right.
136,Ross,Mrs.
137,Ross,Uh-oh...
138,Joey,Uhhhh....
139,Joey,I'll just pee in the street.
140,Joey,Commercial Break
141,Ross,"Hey, is Chandler here?"
142,Joey,Yeah.
143,Ross,"Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell..."
144,Ross,"Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right?"
145,Ross,One kiss?
146,Ross,No big deal?
147,Ross,Right?
148,Joey,Right.
149,Joey,No big deal.
150,Ross,Okay.
151,Joey,In Bizarro World!!
152,Joey,You broke the code!
153,Ross,What code?
154,Joey,You don't kiss your friend's mom!
155,Joey,"Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!"
156,Chandler,What are you guys doing out here?
157,Ross,"Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game."
158,Ross,"But, um, apparently, somebody overslept."
159,Joey,"Yeah, well, you don't have your racket."
160,Ross,"No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one."
161,Joey,"Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size."
162,Chandler,"Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together."
163,Ross,"Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum."
164,Joey,"Ross, how could you let this happen?"
165,Ross,"I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know?"
166,Ross,"She's, she's sexy, she's..."
167,Joey,You don't think my mom's sexy?
168,Ross,Well... not in the same way...
169,Joey,"I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright?"
170,Joey,You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
171,Ross,"Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here..."
172,Rachel,Hey.
173,Ross,Hey.
174,Rachel,What're you guys doing out here?
175,Ross,"Well, not playing raquetball!"
176,Joey,He forgot to leave his grip size!
177,Ross,He didn't get the goggles!
178,Rachel,"Well,sounds like you two have issues."
179,Rachel,"Goodbye, baby."
180,Ross,Do they wait for me to do this?
181,Joey,So are you gonna tell him?
182,Ross,Why would I tell him?
183,Joey,"How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might."
184,Ross,Oh...
185,Monica,What are you guys doing here?
186,Joey,Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
187,Monica,...What did I ask?
188,Monica,Hi.
189,Phoebe,Hi.
190,Monica,What are you doing here?
191,Phoebe,"Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?"
192,Monica,I'm not really here.
193,Monica,Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot?
194,Monica,Without me?
195,Phoebe,No.
196,Phoebe,No!
197,Phoebe,No!
198,Phoebe,"...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?"
199,Monica,How would I know?
200,Monica,I-I wasn't here.
201,Phoebe,Really?
202,Phoebe,"Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?"
203,Chandler,Oh my God.
204,Ross,You're my friend.
205,Ross,I-I had to tell you.
206,Chandler,I can't believe it.
207,Chandler,Paolo kissed my mom?
208,Ross,"Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh..."
209,Ross,"I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom."
210,Chandler,What?
211,Ross,"I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-"
212,Chandler,You knew about this?
213,Joey,"Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing."
214,Chandler,"I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?"
215,Joey,"Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened."
216,Ross,"Thanks, man, big help."
217,Chandler,I can't believe this!
218,Chandler,What the hell were you thinking?
219,Ross,"I wasn't- I mean, I-"
220,Chandler,"Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you."
221,Ross,I know-
222,Chandler,I can't believe you did this.
223,Ross,Chandler-
224,Joey,"Me neither, y'know what-"
225,Chandler,I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
226,Joey,What are you mad at me for?
227,Ross,Chandler-
228,Chandler,You gotta let me slam the door!
229,Joey,"Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did!"
230,Joey,See what happens when you break the code?
231,Ross,Joey-
232,Joey,Ah!
233,Joey,Huh?
234,Monica,Hey.
235,Rachel,Hey.
236,Monica,"'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'."
237,Rachel,Yeah.
238,Rachel,Thought I'd give it a shot.
239,Rachel,I'm still on the first chapter.
240,Rachel,"Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?"
241,Monica,"Yeah, I'd say so."
242,Monica,And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
243,Phoebe,Hey Rach.
244,Rachel,Hey.
245,Phoebe,Hello.
246,Monica,Hello.
247,Phoebe,Going to the hospital tonight?
248,Monica,"No, you?"
249,Phoebe,"No, you?"
250,Monica,You just asked me.
251,Phoebe,"Okay, maybe it was a trick question."
252,Phoebe,"Um, Rachel can we do this now?"
253,Rachel,Okay.
254,Rachel,I am so hot!
255,Joey,"Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day."
256,Joey,Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
257,Ross,I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
258,Joey,C'mon!
259,Joey,"Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all."
260,Rachel,Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
261,Phoebe,Thanks.
262,Phoebe,"Hi, um, 'kay."
263,Phoebe,"I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me."
264,Phoebe,'Kay.
265,Phoebe,"You don't have to be awake to be my man,   As long as you have brainwaves I'll be there to hold your hand."
266,Phoebe,"Though we just met the other day,    There's something I have got to say..."
267,Phoebe,"Okay, thank you very much, I'm gonna take a short break!"
268,Rachel,"Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody."
269,Rachel,Woo!
270,Chandler,What was that?
271,Ross,"Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a..."
272,Chandler,"Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?"
273,Joey,Mother-Kisser...
274,Joey,I'll shut up.
275,Ross,"Chandler, can I just say something?"
276,Ross,"I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night."
277,Ross,Okay?
278,Ross,Two sets of lips.
279,Chandler,"Yes, well, I expect this from her."
280,Chandler,Okay?
281,Chandler,She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
282,Ross,"Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?"
283,Chandler,"Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!"
284,Ross,We're rehearsing a Greek play.
285,Chandler,That's very funny.
286,Chandler,We done now?
287,Ross,No!
288,Ross,"Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?"
289,Chandler,That would be no.
290,Chandler,"Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her."
291,Chandler,Alright?
292,Chandler,"Trust me, you can't talk to her."
293,Ross,"Okay, 'you' can't, or  you can't?"
294,Ross,"Okay, that's my finger."
295,Ross,"That's, that's my knee."
296,Ross,Still doing the play.
297,Ross,Aaah!
298,Phoebe,"Alright, whadyou do with him?"
299,Monica,Oh!
300,Monica,You're awake!
301,Phoebe,Look at you!
302,Phoebe,"How, how do you feel?"
303,Phoebe,Coma
304,Monica,You look good!
305,Monica,Coma
306,Monica,"Oh, sorry."
307,Phoebe,I'm Phoebe Buffay.
308,Monica,I'm Monica Geller.
309,Monica,I've been taking care of you.
310,Phoebe,"Well, we both have."
311,Phoebe,Coma
312,Phoebe,"Well, actually it's just from me."
313,Monica,I got you the foot massager.
314,Phoebe,You know who shaved you?
315,Phoebe,That was me.
316,Monica,I read to you.
317,Phoebe,I sang.
318,Phoebe,Hah!
319,Phoebe,Coma
320,Monica,"Oh, my pleasure."
321,Phoebe,You're welcome.
322,Phoebe,Coma
323,Phoebe,"What, that's it?"
324,Monica,"""See you around?"""
325,Monica,Coma
326,Monica,"Oh, I don't know."
327,Monica,"Maybe, um, ""That was nice?"""
328,Monica,Admit something to me?
329,Monica,"""I'll call you?"""
330,Monica,Coma
331,Phoebe,I don't think you mean that.
332,Monica,This is so typical.
333,Monica,"Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give."
334,Monica,And then- we just get nothing back!
335,Monica,"And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and ""See you around!"""
336,Monica,"Let's go, Phoebe."
337,Phoebe,Y'know what?
338,Phoebe,We thought you were different.
339,Phoebe,But I guess it was just the coma.
340,Chandler,"No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough."
341,Chandler,Mrs.
342,Chandler,You kissed my best Ross!
343,Chandler,...Or something to that effect.
344,Chandler,Mrs.
345,Chandler,Really stupid.
346,Chandler,Mrs.
347,Chandler,Yeah.
348,Chandler,No.
349,Chandler,No...
350,Ross,"Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door."
351,Joey,Shh.
352,Joey,He did it.
353,Joey,"He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything."
354,Ross,You're kidding.
355,Joey,"No, no."
356,Joey,"He said ""When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"""
357,Ross,Wow!
358,Joey,"Then she came back with ""The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"""
359,Ross,"'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say ""When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"""
360,Joey,That makes more sense.
361,Ross,"So, what's going on now?"
362,Joey,"I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you!"
363,Joey,I don't hear anything.
364,Joey,"Oh, wait, wait, wait."
365,Ross,Whaddya see?
366,Joey,"Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down."
367,Joey,"Wait, wait."
368,Joey,"They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us!"
369,Joey,Run!
370,Joey,Run!
371,Joey,Mrs.
372,Chandler,"Yeah, okay."
373,Chandler,Mrs.
374,Chandler,Nice save.
375,Ross,Mrs. Bing.
376,Ross,Mrs.
377,Chandler,Hey.
378,Ross,You mean that?
379,Chandler,"Yeah, why not."
380,Chandler,So I told her.
381,Ross,Yeah?
382,Ross,How'd it go?
383,Chandler,Awful.
384,Chandler,Awful.
385,Chandler,Couldn'ta gone worse.
386,Ross,"Well, howdya feel?"
387,Chandler,Pretty good!
388,Chandler,I told her.
389,Ross,"Well, see?"
390,Ross,"So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh?"
391,Ross,Huh?
392,Ross,But.. we don't have to go down that road.
393,Ross,Closing Credits
394,Rachel,Okay.
395,Rachel,"Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion."
396,Rachel,"Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'."
397,Monica,What's a 'niffle'?
398,Joey,You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
399,Rachel,"Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist..."
400,Ross,"Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'?"
401,Ross,"Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!"
402,Rachel,"Alright, that's it!"
403,Rachel,Give it back!
404,Rachel,That's it!
0,Phoebe,Hey!
1,Phoebe,"New wallet, huh?"
2,Chandler,"Yeah, it was time."
3,Chandler,The old condom ring in the leather just doesn't say cool' anymore.
4,Monica,Rachel!
5,Rachel,What?
6,Monica,You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
7,Rachel,"Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full."
8,Monica,Have you ever taken out the trash?
9,Rachel,"Well, I thought you liked doing it."
10,Monica,Third door on the left.
11,Rachel,Right!
12,Rachel,Oh!
13,Rachel,"Hey, Mr. Treeger."
14,Rachel,Mr.
15,Rachel,Ummm.
16,Rachel,Oh!
17,Rachel,I'm sorry.
18,Rachel,It's a little old but Mr.
19,Rachel,I'm sorry.
20,Rachel,I didn'tI don't come in here a lot.
21,Rachel,Mr.
22,Rachel,No.
23,Rachel,Mr.
24,Rachel,I didn't I never said that.
25,Rachel,Mr.
26,Rachel,"Okay, I'm sorry."
27,Monica,God!
28,Monica,If you're gonna cry about it!
29,Monica,(She grabs the box and goes to through it out.]
30,Monica,Opening Credits
31,Joey,"Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?"
32,Rachel,Yes!
33,Rachel,And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
34,Joey,I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
35,Monica,"Joey, please don't do that."
36,Monica,I think it's best that we just forget about it.
37,Rachel,"That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed."
38,Joey,"All right that's it, school is in session!"
39,Monica,My God!
40,Monica,Is this a gym card?
41,Chandler,"Oh yeah, gym member."
42,Chandler,"I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times."
43,Ross,So why don't you quit?
44,Chandler,You don't think I've tried?
45,Chandler,You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month?
46,Chandler,"No, they make you go all the way down there!"
47,Chandler,Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you!
48,Chandler,Then they bring out Maria.
49,Ross,Who is Maria?
50,Chandler,Oh Maria.
51,Chandler,"You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gymtreat."
52,Ross,You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
53,Chandler,No!
54,Ross,So you're strong enough to face her on your own?
55,Chandler,"Oh no, you'll have to come."
56,Joey,Hey!
57,Joey,You hold on pal!
58,Joey,"Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry."
59,Joey,"So now, you're gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord."
60,Joey,Mr.
61,Joey,"Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry."
62,Joey,Mr.
63,Joey,I have actually not heard of that.
64,Joey,Mr.
65,Joey,Why don't you tell me something I don't know!
66,Phoebe,"Oh please, somebody tell me I don't have to go to work today!"
67,Monica,What's the matter?
68,Phoebe,"Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I'm not allowed to charge for."
69,Monica,So do them for free.
70,Phoebe,"Oh no, it is forbidden!"
71,Phoebe,"No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients."
72,Phoebe,And it's against my oath as a masseuse.
73,Ross,They make you take an oath?
74,Phoebe,"No, I made myself take an oath."
75,Phoebe,"Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared."
76,Phoebe,"Yeah, that one's actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense."
77,Chandler,Why don't you just give him to somebody else?
78,Phoebe,"No, I can handle it."
79,Phoebe,"No, I'm a professional."
80,Rachel,"Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?"
81,Monica,Wow!
82,Monica,And you got a petticure.
83,Monica,Your feet are all dressed up.
84,Chandler,Because that's the only part of you he can see when he's on the table!
85,Monica,You're gonna do some feet flirtin'!
86,Phoebe,I don't what your talking about.
87,Ross,Then how do you explain the toe ring?
88,Phoebe,Because it's Arabian princess day at work!
89,Phoebe,Okay?!
90,Phoebe,Leave me alone!
91,Rachel,Oh!
92,Rachel,My hero!
93,Rachel,What happened?
94,Joey,"Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he'd better come up here and apologize."
95,Joey,I'll see you later.
96,Monica,"What a minute, what did he say?"
97,Joey,"He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he's gonna do is have you evictedI'll see you later."
98,Rachel,What?!
99,Rachel,You got us evicted!
100,Monica,I told you not to go down there!
101,Joey,Well he made Rachel cry!
102,Monica,Rachel always cries!
103,Rachel,That's not true!
104,Monica,"Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him."
105,Monica,I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!
106,Joey,All right!
107,Joey,I'll try!
108,Joey,"But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled."
109,Rachel,Go!
110,Joey,"All right, all right, all right."
111,Joey,"I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it."
112,Ross,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey!"
113,Ross,"Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong."
114,Chandler,Yes.
115,Chandler,Yes!
116,Ross,"One more time, ""Hey, don't you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"""
117,Chandler,No!
118,Chandler,I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
119,Ross,Good!
120,Ross,That's good!
121,Chandler,Okay.
122,Chandler,I wanna quit the gym.
123,Chandler,Gym

131,Chandler,I wanna quit the gym.
132,Ross,"It's okay man, be strong."
133,Ross,Gym
134,Ross,No!
135,Ross,"And I'm not gonna be, so you can save you little speech."
136,Ross,Gym
137,Phoebe,These old things.
138,Phoebe,"You mean theOkay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion."
139,Phoebe,"Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y'know, real  nice and tight."
140,Phoebe,"So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area."
141,Phoebe,Oh.
142,Phoebe,No!
143,Joey,"Please don't kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn't there fault, it was mine."
144,Joey,Mr.
145,Joey,"No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live?"
146,Joey,Mr.
147,Joey,"Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames."
148,Joey,I'm the chick and Chandler is the duck.
149,Joey,Mr.
150,Joey,"Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I'll do whatever you want."
151,Joey,Mr.
152,Joey,"Yeah-yeah, absolutely."
153,Joey,Mr.
154,Joey,"What, what is it?"
155,Joey,Mr.
156,Joey,"That's not, prison lingo, is it?"
157,Joey,Commercial Break
158,Monica,His dancing partner?
159,Joey,"Yeah, there's this superintendent's dance, the Super Ball."
160,Joey,"I don't know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he's a crush on."
161,Rachel,"Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?"
162,Joey,"Well, he's too shy, he doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet."
163,Rachel,"Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down thatgarbage chute."
164,Monica,"Oh, would you let it go already?!"
165,Monica,You're fine!
166,Chandler,Hey.
167,Rachel,Hey!
168,Rachel,"So, did you quit?"
169,Chandler,"No, I almost did, couldn't leave Ross there without a spotter!"
170,Monica,"Wait, now so you joined the gym?"
171,Ross,"And that's funny, why?"
172,Rachel,"Oh, umm, I was just y'know working out and umm Oh, that's it."
173,Chandler,We're doomed.
174,Chandler,"Okay, they're gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives."
175,Chandler,What are we gonna do?
176,Monica,"Well, you could actually go to the gym."
177,Ross,Or!
178,Ross,"Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source."
179,Chandler,You're a genius!
180,Joey,"Aww, man, now we won't be bank buddies!"
181,Chandler,"Now, there's two reasons."
182,Phoebe,Hey.
183,Phoebe,"Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about?"
184,Phoebe,I bit him.
185,Rachel,Where?
186,Phoebe,On the touchy.
187,Ross,And that's not against your oath?
188,Phoebe,"No, I know!"
189,Phoebe,"I-I'm sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one."
190,Monica,"Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself."
191,Joey,Yeah!
192,Joey,Yeah!
193,Joey,Yeah!
194,Joey,"Like-like when I'm doing something exciting and I don't wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y'know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!"

202,Joey,"No, it's okay, but if I'm Marge, my breasts are coming out my back."
203,Joey,Mr.

207,Joey,"You just ahh, you just need more practice."
208,Joey,"Here, come on, let's ahh, let's try it again."

223,Rachel,You are soo enjoying this.
224,Joey,"No, I'm not!"
225,Joey,And it wasn't a hop it was a pademarie.
226,Monica,You know the words!
227,Monica,You are so into this!
228,Joey,"All right, well maybe I'm enjoying it a little bit."
229,Joey,I mean I'm getting pretty good at it.

258,Phoebe,Chandler's ankles.
259,Phoebe,Chandler's ankle hair.
260,Phoebe,Oh no.
261,Phoebe,"Okay, you're all set."

183,Chandler,"Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing."
184,Chandler,You could get arrested.
185,Phoebe,"You could get arrested, right now!"
186,Phoebe,"All right, yeah, I gotta take it back."

203,Chandler,Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that?
204,Chandler,I kinda have a dream!
205,Chandler,I don't want to talk about it.
206,Joey,"Well, it involved Monica."
207,Chandler,You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?!
208,Chandler,"Oh, that is so cool!"
209,Chandler,I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing.
210,Chandler,Anyway we're talking about your dream.
211,Chandler,I love you.
212,Chandler,Your dream?
213,Joey,"Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything."
214,Joey,I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.
215,Monica,What was the dream about?
216,Joey,"Well, okay."
217,Joey,You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle.
218,Joey,Y'know like you guys were doing last night.
219,Joey,"So, that's it."
220,Joey,I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
221,Monica,"Wait, Joey!"
222,Monica,Joey!
223,Monica,That doesn't mean that-that you're in love with me!
224,Joey,It-it doesn't?
225,Monica,No!
226,Chandler,"No, it can mean anything."
227,Chandler,"Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud."
228,Joey,That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
229,Monica,"Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too."
230,Joey,In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
231,Monica,Um-hmm.
232,Chandler,"Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica?"
233,Chandler,"Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?"
234,Joey,Not really.
235,Chandler,Well there you have it!
236,Monica,Well sure!
237,Monica,I'm just wearing sweats!
238,Monica,"But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!"
239,Joey,"No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend."
240,Joey,Y'know?
241,Joey,"I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend!"
242,Joey,"Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?"
243,Chandler,"Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating."
244,Chandler,So maybe-maybe that's it?
245,Joey,Friends first?
246,Joey,That's interesting.
247,Monica,You become friends after?
248,Joey,"No, never done that either."
249,Rachel,"Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?"
250,Chandler,"Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom."
251,Monica,That's right.
252,Rachel,What's up Joey?
253,Joey,How you doin'?
254,Joey,Commercial Break
255,Phoebe,"Excuse me, is this your car?"
256,Phoebe,"Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance."
257,Phoebe,"Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop."
258,Phoebe,"Ohh, no."
259,Phoebe,"Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too."
260,Phoebe,"So, all right, keep up the good work."
261,Phoebe,10-4.
262,Phoebe,"I-I'm with the umm, the 57th."
263,Phoebe,I'm in vice.
264,Phoebe,"Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now."
265,Phoebe,I'm a whore.
266,Phoebe,"Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?"
267,Phoebe,"Yeah, big guy, kinda bald."
268,Phoebe,"Don't try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out."

270,Phoebe,"I-I sure will, take care."
271,Phoebe,Oh.
272,Rachel,Hey!
273,Rachel,"Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?"
274,Joey,"Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class."
275,Joey,But y'know what?
276,Joey,"I guess I can blow that off,  for you."
277,Rachel,Thanks!
278,Joey,"Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something."
279,Joey,"Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight."
280,Rachel,I know.
281,Joey,Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there.
282,Joey,I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
283,Rachel,What's up Joe?
284,Joey,"Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great"
285,Rachel,Yeah?
286,Joey,is because they were friends first.
287,Joey,Y'know?
288,Joey,"So I asked myself, ""Who are my friends?"""
289,Joey,"You and Phoebe, and I saw you first."
290,Joey,So
291,Rachel,What are you saying?
292,Joey,I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
293,Rachel,"Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up."
294,Joey,I'll treat you real nice.
295,Rachel,"Yeah, well, y'know umm No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date."
296,Rachel,Don't hit on your existing friends!
297,Joey,Won't-won't that take longer?
298,Rachel,Yeah.
299,Rachel,Yeah.
300,Rachel,"Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait."
301,Joey,Yeah.
302,Joey,I understand.
303,Joey,I understand.
304,Joey,"Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!"
305,Ross,Come here to me.
306,Ross,"No-no, you come here to me."
307,Rachel,Hey Ross!
308,Rachel,I brought reinforcements.
309,Ross,Oh great!
310,Ross,"What, you brought Joey?"
311,Rachel,"Well, I brought the next best thing."
312,Chandler,Hey!
313,Ross,Chandler?!
314,Ross,You brought Chandler?!
315,Ross,The next best thing would be Monica!
316,Chandler,"Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so"
317,Ross,"Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it."
318,Ross,"Okay Rach,  that's you."
319,Ross,That's the couch.
320,Rachel,"Whoa-oh, what's-what's that?"
321,Ross,"Oh, that's me."
322,Rachel,Wow!
323,Rachel,You certainly think a lot of yourself.
324,Ross,No!
325,Ross,That's-that's my arm!
326,Chandler,"Oh, I see."
327,Chandler,"I thought you just really, really liked your new couch."

376,Joey,"Well look, hey, it's all your fault!"
377,Rachel,What?!
378,Rachel,Why?
379,Joey,Well because you didn't give me advice!
380,Joey,No!
381,Joey,You gave me a pickup line!
382,Joey,"As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first."
383,Joey,"I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her!"
384,Joey,And her roommate!
385,Monica,What about the closeness?
386,Joey,Closeness-shmoshness!

403,Phoebe,"Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you  with me."
404,Phoebe,Harboring a fugitive?
405,Phoebe,That's one to three years minimum.
406,Phoebe,Good luck Chandler.
407,Phoebe,"Okay, you can arrest me."
408,Phoebe,Fine.
409,Phoebe,But you'll never make it stick and you know it!
410,Phoebe,Yep!
411,Phoebe,As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool.
412,Phoebe,A fool!
413,Phoebe,I would love it if I weren't here!
414,Phoebe,Me?

34,Monica,Hi!
35,Monica,"Hey, Pete you're back!"
36,Monica,"Hey, check this out."
37,Monica,Wow!
38,Monica,You're a lot sturdier that Chandler.
39,Monica,He crumpled like a piece of paper.
40,Monica,So how was you're trip?
41,Monica,"Oh, what'd ya bring me?!"
42,Monica,"Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan."
43,Monica,"Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection."
44,Monica,You want some coffee?
45,Monica,Regular or decaf?
46,Monica,Okay.
47,Monica,So what did you do today Pete?
48,Monica,What?!
49,Monica,Oh.
50,Monica,Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
51,Rachel,What a jerk!
52,Rachel,You want me to kick his ass?
53,Monica,I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery.
54,Monica,I mean I would kill for this job.
55,Monica,"I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues."
56,Monica,But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
57,Rachel,And you're still not attracted to him at all?
58,Monica,"Hmm, no."
59,Monica,I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him?
60,Monica,I-I-I-I can't.
61,Monica,I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
62,Rachel,"Yeah, but Mon that's totally different."
63,Rachel,He was you're health teacher.
64,Monica,"Oh, please."
65,Monica,What?
66,Monica,Honey.
67,Rachel,"Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday."
68,Monica,"Oh God, I'm so sorry."
69,Rachel,I know.
70,Rachel,Ow!
71,Monica,Oh God!
72,Ross,"Hey, you guys!"
73,Ross,Guess what?
74,Rachel,Got a job on a river boat?
75,Ross,Y'know what I didn't wear this suit for a year because you hated it.
76,Ross,"Well, guess what?"
77,Ross,You're not my girlfriend anymore so...
78,Rachel,"Oh I see, so this suit is making a point."
79,Ross,Right.
80,Rachel,"Now that you're on you're own, you're free to look as stupid as you like."
81,Ross,You like it right?
82,Monica,Oh absolutely.
83,Monica,I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.
84,Monica,Ross!
85,Monica,Ross!
86,Monica,I'm kidding!
87,Rachel,"Yeah, come here!"
88,Monica,What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
89,Rachel,Yeah.
90,Rachel,Oh!
91,Rachel,Was how you invented the cotton gin?
92,Ross,"Okay, good bye!"
93,Chandler,"So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen."
94,Phoebe,"Umm, oh, about three months."
95,Chandler,"Okay, so I guess that's about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in."
96,Joey,Hey!
97,Chandler,Hey!
98,Joey,I got you something!
99,Joey,Open it!
100,Joey,Open it!
101,Chandler,Okay.

103,Joey,"It's cute, huh?"
104,Phoebe,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?"
105,Chandler,Fowl?
106,Chandler,No.
107,Chandler,Women?
108,Chandler,Nooo.
109,Phoebe,"Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age."
110,Phoebe,They require constant care.
111,Phoebe,"They-they need just the right food, and lot's and lot's of love."
112,Joey,"Oh, well no problem there."
113,Chandler,Easy Lenny.
114,Monica,Okay.
115,Monica,Here's the thing.
116,Monica,I can't do it.
117,Monica,"I'm sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me...."
118,Monica,Huh?
119,Monica,Oh?
120,Monica,"Oh, that's great!"
121,Monica,"I mean I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you."
122,Monica,And now I can work for you!
123,Monica,Oh my God!
124,Monica,"Oh, this is incredible!"
125,Monica,Ohh!
126,Monica,"All right, y'know what?"
127,Monica,I'm just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
128,Monica,Okay.
129,Monica,Can you give me a little push?
130,Monica,I'm quitting!!
131,Monica,Woo-hoo!
132,Monica,I'm okay!!
133,Monica,I'm all right!
134,Phoebe,Wow!
135,Phoebe,"That's exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman."
136,Phoebe,"I'm just saying, this woman, I mean she's fictitious."
137,Phoebe,No?
138,Phoebe,Cause you're still into Monica.
139,Phoebe,"So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and..."
140,Phoebe,"Yeah, no, I'm fairly intuitive and psychic."
141,Phoebe,It's a substantial gift.
142,Phoebe,"Absolutely, oh I promise."
143,Phoebe,Tell her what?
144,Phoebe,No I'm serious.
145,Phoebe,"I mean I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks."
146,Chandler,"Okay, but this is the last time."
147,Chandler,"With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there."
148,Chandler,"Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen."
149,Joey,Hey.
150,Chandler,Hey.
151,Joey,How's she doing?
152,Chandler,She?
153,Joey,"Well yeah, don't-don't you think it's a she?"
154,Chandler,I don't know.
155,Chandler,"I can't tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly."
156,Joey,"Well, anyway, I got to go change, I'm ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks."
157,Chandler,Excuse me?
158,Joey,What?
159,Chandler,I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
160,Joey,Hey!
161,Joey,Who was up from 2 o'clock this morning until 5 o'clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
162,Chandler,You don't think I get up when you get up?
163,Joey,"Ohhh, here it comes."
164,Chandler,"Yes, here it comes!"
165,Chandler,"I'm stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends?"
166,Chandler,Well I don't think so mister!
167,Joey,Hey!!
168,Joey,I need to relax!
169,Joey,Okay?
170,Joey,I was working all day!
171,Chandler,And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?
172,Joey,That's not what I said.
173,Joey,"Okay, I just meant..."
174,Chandler,I know what you meant!!
175,Chandler,"You notice that ever since we got this chick, we've been fighting a lot more than we used too?"
176,Joey,"I don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick."
177,Chandler,I'll take her back tomorrow.
178,Joey,Do you think we'll get our three bucks back?
179,Ross,Hey!
180,Chandler,Hey!
181,Ross,"Ohhh, hey!"
182,Ross,"All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay?"
183,Ross,What do you think?
184,Ross,"This blue suit, or this brown one?"
185,Joey,"Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one."
186,Ross,Really?
187,Rachel,Oww!
188,Ross,Wow!
189,Ross,That aspirin dance really works!
190,Rachel,Oww!
191,Ross,"Oh my God, is that still..."
192,Rachel,"I'm fine, I'm fine."
193,Ross,No you're not.
194,Rachel,Yes I am!
195,Ross,Rach!
196,Rachel,"Look, I'm fine."
197,Rachel,Watch.
198,Rachel,Look at that.
199,Rachel,Whoa-whoa!
200,Ross,"Okay, okay."
201,Ross,"Look, you have got to go to a doctor!"
202,Ross,Okay?
203,Rachel,No.
204,Rachel,I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house.
205,Rachel,"It's a very big deal, there's a lot of people there I have to meet."
206,Ross,And I'm sure you're gonna make a big impression.
207,Ross,Hi!
208,Ross,I'm Rachel Green.
209,Ross,It's nice to meet you.
210,Ross,"Come on, you probably have a broken rib!"
211,Rachel,"Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it'll still be broken then."
212,Ross,Rach...
213,Rachel,"But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready."
214,Ross,Rachel...
215,Rachel,"Look, either help me or go."
216,Ross,Fine.
217,Ross,I'll go.
218,Rachel,"Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?"
219,Ross,Sure.

227,Rachel,"Would you please, help me with this too?"
228,Ross,Ohh.
229,Rachel,Okay.
230,Rachel,Let's use this brush.
231,Ross,Okay.

251,Rachel,"Okay, now make it even, cause we don't..."
252,Ross,What?
253,Ross,What?
254,Rachel,"We don't want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle."
255,Ross,No.
256,Ross,"No, y'know you don't, you don't wear enough of this."
257,Ross,What?
258,Rachel,"Since when, since when do you think I don't wear enough of this?"
259,Ross,"Well I, close your eyes, I just think you're gonna like this a little better, cause, close-close..."
260,Rachel,Blow it.
261,Ross,Sorry.
262,Ross,"Cause umm, I think this will make you a little more sophisticated."
263,Rachel,Sophisticated like a hooker?
264,Monica,Hey!
265,Phoebe,Hey!
266,Monica,"Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight."
267,Phoebe,What?

270,Monica,I know.
271,Phoebe,"Ooh, I have to tell you something."
272,Monica,What?
273,Phoebe,But I can't tell you.
274,Monica,"Okay, but wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me."
275,Phoebe,"Well, sure in a perfect world."
276,Phoebe,"But, no, I promised I wouldn't tell, and I swore to like all my gods."
277,Monica,Okay.
278,Monica,Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
279,Phoebe,No.
280,Monica,Does it have to do with Joey?
281,Phoebe,No.
282,Monica,Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
283,Phoebe,"No, but let's come back to that later!"
284,Ross,There you go!
285,Ross,"Good enough for your party, huh?"

298,Ross,What?
299,Rachel,I don't want you to see me naked!
300,Ross,"Rachel, I've seen you naked a million times."
301,Ross,I ate hot fudge off you naked.
302,Ross,"Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?"
303,Rachel,"Yeah, but that was different."
304,Rachel,Y'know?
305,Rachel,"I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it's weird."
306,Ross,"Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want."
307,Rachel,What?
308,Ross,All I have to do is close my eyes.
309,Ross,See?
310,Ross,Woo-hoo!
311,Rachel,Ross!
312,Rachel,Stop that!
313,Ross,"Ah, I'm sorry."
314,Rachel,Come on!
315,Rachel,I don't want you thinking of me like that any more!
316,Ross,"Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it."
317,Ross,"It's one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend."
318,Ross,"Oop, oh yeah!"
319,Rachel,Stop it!

367,Rachel,"I'm sorry, I just can't go to the hospital lookin' like this."
368,Monica,Does it involve travel?
369,Phoebe,Noo!
370,Monica,Does it involve clogs?
371,Phoebe,"Oh, wait, wait."
372,Phoebe,"Clogs, or claws?"
373,Monica,Clogs.
374,Phoebe,No.
375,Monica,Claws?
376,Phoebe,No.
377,Monica,"Okay, so it doesn't involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey."
378,Monica,"But, what about Pete?"
379,Phoebe,No!
380,Monica,What is it?!
381,Monica,What about Pete?
382,Phoebe,I don't know!
383,Monica,"Okay, I feel like I'm talking to Lassie."
384,Monica,"All right, Phoebe would you just tell me!"

389,Monica,"Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete's computer company?"
390,Phoebe,"Oh, just go."
391,Phoebe,You're never gonna get it!
392,Chandler,I know.
393,Chandler,"See, yes."
394,Chandler,"That's Yasmine Bleeth, she's a completely different kind of chick."
395,Chandler,I love you both.
396,Chandler,But in very different ways.
397,Joey,Hey!
398,Chandler,Hey!
399,Joey,Ohhh.
400,Joey,Ahh!
401,Joey,What are you doing?!
402,Joey,I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.
403,Chandler,I did!
404,Chandler,But the store wouldn't take her back!
405,Chandler,"So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?"
406,Chandler,"If they can't find a home for her, they kill her!"
407,Chandler,And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
408,Joey,"Okay, good, good, good, cause, good, cause I was kinda having second thoughts too."
409,Chandler,Okay.
410,Chandler,And it's not just chicks y'know?
411,Chandler,It's all kinds of other animals!
412,Joey,That's horrible!
413,Joey,"Well, you did the right thing man."
414,Chandler,"Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way."
415,Chandler,"Ohhh-hoo, funny story!"
416,Monica,I don't believe this!
417,Monica,"Wow, look at this refrigerator!"
418,Monica,It's gigantic!
419,Monica,I mean I could live in this thing!
420,Monica,"I'd be cold, but I'm always cold."
421,Monica,"Oh my God, look at these spider burners!"
422,Monica,I love spider burners.
423,Monica,"Oh, it is sooo perfect."
424,Monica,Thank you so much.
425,Monica,Did you just smell my hair?
426,Monica,Oh God.
427,Monica,You still have feelings for me don't you?
428,Monica,Pete.
429,Monica,"No, it's not bad."
430,Monica,It's not bad at all.
431,Monica,It's-it's really nice.
432,Monica,"You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you."
433,Monica,That's why I can't take this job.
434,Monica,"And well, we probably shouldn't see each other anymore."
435,Monica,I'm sorry.
436,Monica,"Okay, bye."
437,Monica,All right shut up for a second and let me just see something.
438,Monica,"Oh, wow!"
439,Rachel,"Okay, you'd tell me the truth."
440,Rachel,Right?
441,Ross,"Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray."
442,Rachel,Okay.
443,Chandler,Okay!
444,Chandler,"Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!"
445,Ross,That's a duck.
446,Chandler,That's a bad duck!!!
447,Chandler,"How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?"
448,Ross,"Oh, it was, nah, well...."

454,Chandler,"Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that, that chick is not a toy!"
455,Rachel,What thing?
456,Rachel,What is this thing?
457,Ross,"I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel."
458,Rachel,Oh my God!
459,Ross,Yeah.
460,Rachel,"Ross, why didn't you tell me that?"
461,Ross,"Eh, cause I knew that if I told you, you'd make me go, and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight."
462,Ross,Come on.
463,Ross,Come on.
464,Rachel,I cannot believe you.
465,Ross,What?
466,Rachel,"That is the sweetest thing, I just...."
467,Ross,You should get some sleep.
468,Rachel,Okay.
469,Ross,"So, I'll umm..."

479,Joey,What about the chick?
480,Chandler,Chicks don't swim.
481,Joey,Are you sure?
482,Chandler,I don't know.
483,Chandler,Should we try it?
484,Joey,Sure.
485,Chandler,"See, I told you they don't swim."
486,Joey,Wait.
487,Joey,Give him a minute.

2,Monica,Hey!
3,Rachel,"So, I'm in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down."
4,Joey,"Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani."
5,Joey,That's me!!
6,Joey,I'm blank!

10,Joey,Yeah you are baby.
11,Monica,"Three down knows I'm married, what's three down doin'?"
12,Rachel,So did they call you to tell you your name's gonna be in this?
13,Joey,No.
14,Joey,They really like me over there.
15,Joey,"They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no."
16,Ross,Why'd you say no?
17,Joey,Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them?
18,Joey,"I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft."
19,Joey,So who knows what I might say this time.
20,Chandler,If only there was something in your head to control the things you say.
21,Rachel,"Oh, come on Joey!"
22,Rachel,"You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y'know the publicity would be really good for your career!"
23,Rachel,And you deserve that!
24,Rachel,"And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don't know, gal pal Rachel Green?"
25,Chandler,Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?

121,Ross,"So uh, how are you guys doing?"
122,Joey,"Oh-no, don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear."
123,Chandler,Where is Emily?
124,Ross,"Ugh, she's saying good-bye to her uncle."
125,Chandler,"Man, didn't she like just get here?"
126,Ross,Yeah!!
127,Ross,Yeah!
128,Chandler,Easy tiger.
129,Ross,"I just, I hate this so much!"
130,Ross,"I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it's-it's so great."
131,Ross,"But at the same time I'm thinking, ""Well, I'm gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."""
132,Chandler,So what are you going to do?
133,Ross,Nothing!
134,Ross,There's nothing to do!
135,Ross,"I mean, she lives there, I live here."
136,Ross,"I mean, she-she'd have to uh, move here."
137,Ross,She should move here!
138,Joey,What?
139,Ross,I could ask her to live with me!
140,Chandler,Are you serious?
141,Ross,"I mean, why not!"
142,Ross,"I mean, I mean why not?"
143,Chandler,Because you've only known her for six weeks!
144,Chandler,"Okay, I've got a carton of milk in my fridge I've had a longer relationship with!"
145,Ross,"Look guys, when I'm with her it's-it's-it's like she brings this-this-this great side out of me."
146,Ross,"I mean I-I-I love her, y'know?"
147,Chandler,And I love the milk!
148,Chandler,"But, I'm not gonna some British girl to move in with me!"
149,Chandler,"Joey, you say things now."
150,Joey,"All right look, Ross, he's right."
151,Joey,"Emily's great, she's great!"
152,Joey,"But this way too soon, you're only gonna scare her!"
153,Ross,I don't want to do that.
154,Joey,No!
155,Joey,"You don't want to wreck it, you don't want to go to fast!"
156,Ross,"Yeah, no, you're right, I know, you're right, I'm not, I'm not gonna do it."
157,Ross,"All right, thanks guys."
158,Chandler,"Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go."
159,Phoebe,That's too hard.
160,Phoebe,Too hard!
161,Monica,"All right boys, last chance for the tickets!"
162,Rachel,"Or I'll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua."
163,Chandler,No thank you.
164,Joey,Wait-wait-wait-wait!
165,Joey,Come on!
166,Joey,"Come on, let's trade!"
167,Joey,"The timing's perfect, I just clogged the toilet!"
168,Chandler,"Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do!"
169,Chandler,"Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here!"
170,Chandler,Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
171,Joey,Yes!
172,Joey,Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?!
173,Joey,No!
174,Joey,I didn't read yours!
175,Joey,"But come on, we can go to the game tonight!"
176,Chandler,"Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats."
177,Joey,It's the Knicks!
178,Chandler,Screw the Knicks!
179,Joey,Whoa!
180,Chandler,I didn't mean that.
181,Chandler,I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
182,Joey,Huh.
183,Chandler,And the Knicks rule all.
184,Joey,"Yeah, the Knicks rule all!"
185,Phoebe,"Hey, so?"
186,Phoebe,Are you gonna do it?
187,Chandler,No.
188,Chandler,No.
189,Chandler,"We're not gonna do that, y'know why?"
190,Chandler,Because its not an even trade.
191,Rachel,"All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?"
192,Joey,Done!
193,Rachel,Let me finish.
194,Joey,Oh.
195,Rachel,"I'm talking about a bet, winner takes all."
196,Joey,"Ooh, we could end up with nothing."
197,Phoebe,Or you could end up with everything.
198,Joey,"Ooh, I like that."
199,Monica,"All right, so what do you say?"
200,Chandler,No!
201,Monica,"Oh, just do it!"
202,Chandler,"Op, op, I'm convinced!"
203,Joey,"Come on man, you know I'd do it for you!"
204,Joey,"Because, you're my best friend."
205,Chandler,"All right, but you can't use that again for a whole year."
206,Chandler,I'm in.
207,Joey,All right!
208,Phoebe,"Ooh, this is so exciting!"
209,Phoebe,"Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?"
210,Rachel,"Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she's the only who's impartial, and she's so pretty."
211,Phoebe,Okay.
212,Phoebe,"Umm, ooh, oohoh, I have a game!"
213,Joey,Okay!
214,Chandler,Okay!
215,Phoebe,This is great!

218,Phoebe,"Oh, well, it doesn't have a nameoh, okay, Phoebeball!"
219,Phoebe,"No, it doesn't have a name."
220,Phoebe,"Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?"
221,Monica,They're green?
222,Phoebe,Good!
223,Phoebe,Good!
224,Phoebe,Five points!
225,Phoebe,"All right, Joey, same question."
226,Joey,"Uhh, they're tall."
227,Phoebe,"Ooh, three points."
228,Phoebe,"Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy."
229,Monica,That's not even a game!
230,Rachel,What?
231,Rachel,Shut up!
232,Rachel,We're winning!
233,Monica,You wanna finish this right now?
234,Monica,"All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins."
235,Monica,What do you say?
236,Chandler,"Fine, let's do it."
237,Phoebe,"Oh, I have cards!"
238,Joey,Oh.
239,Monica,"Oh, good."
240,Phoebe,Yeah!

290,Chandler,No they didn't!
291,Ross,Hey!
292,Ross,Move in with me.
293,Ross,"Don't be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it's too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be."
294,Ross,I know.
295,Ross,"Well, so, you-you'll get a job here!"
296,Ross,"I mean, I'm always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!"
297,Ross,"No, I can't."
298,Ross,"I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can't leave him."
299,Ross,Isn'tyou don't think there's any way?
300,Ross,What?
301,Ross,"No, no, don't."
302,Ross,Why don't we?
303,Ross,Get married.
304,Ross,No!

306,Ross,I'm not!
307,Ross,It's-it's-it's perfect!
308,Ross,"I mean it's better than you just-just moving here, cause it's us together forever, and that's-that's what I want."
309,Ross,"Yeah, I know, so what?"
310,Ross,"I mean, who's-who's to say?"
311,Ross,Does that me we-we can't do it?
312,Ross,"Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian."
313,Ross,"I mean, this, this makes sense for us."
314,Ross,Come on!
315,Ross,"I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont!"
316,Ross,"I mean, last night I got my ear pierced!"
317,Ross,Me!
318,Ross,This feels right.
319,Ross,Doesn't it?
320,Ross,Is thatare you saying yes?
321,Ross,Is that yes?

325,Ross,"Come here, come here."
326,Ross,"Uh,  ow!"
327,Ross,"Emily, will you marry me?"
328,Ross,Damn!
329,Ross,I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
330,Chandler,Those were like the best seats ever.
331,Joey,Oh yeah.
332,Joey,Hey!
333,Joey,Should we give these shirts to the girls?
334,Joey,"Y'know, kinda like a peace offering."
335,Chandler,"Oh yeah, that's very nice."
336,Chandler,"Plus, y'know they were free and they're too small."
337,Chandler,Oh.
338,Chandler,"Oh, God!"
339,Joey,"Hey, want a beer?"
340,Joey,WHOA!!!
341,Chandler,I KNOW!!
342,Chandler,Open up!
343,Chandler,Open up!
344,Chandler,Open up!
345,Monica,"We'll discuss it, in the morning!"
346,Chandler,What the hell is going on?
347,Rachel,We took our apartment back!
348,Phoebe,I had nothing to do with it.
349,Phoebe,"Okay, it was my idea, but I don't feel good about it."
350,Chandler,"We are switching back, right now!"
351,Monica,"No, we're not!"
352,Monica,We're not leaving!
353,Chandler,"Well, you're gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we're switching it back!"
354,Chandler,There's nothing you can do to stop us!
355,Chandler,"Right, Joe?"
356,Joey,I don't know.
357,Chandler,What?
358,Joey,I don't want to move again!
359,Chandler,"I don't care, this is our apartment!"
360,Chandler,"And they stoleyou stole itour apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice!"
361,Chandler,And I am getting it back right now.
362,Chandler,I'm getting back right now!
363,Rachel,All right.
364,Rachel,"We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer."
365,Chandler,"Oh no-no-no, no more offers."
366,Chandler,You can't offer anything to us!
367,Rachel,Let us keep the apartment and
368,Monica,"As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute."
369,Chandler,Totally worth it!
370,Joey,That was one good minute!
371,Chandler,Good night.
372,Joey,Good night.
373,Monica,Men are such idiots.
374,Rachel,Yeah!
375,Rachel,Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
376,Phoebe,"That's so funny to think if you'd just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all."
377,Monica,"Yeah, let-let-let's pretend that's not true."
378,Rachel,Yeah.
379,Phoebe,"Okay, scarf's done."

390,Phoebe,"Oh, are you pregnant too?"
391,Monica,"When, when didhow, how did you"
392,Ross,"We, we just decided to uh, to go for it."
393,Ross,"Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys"
394,Rachel,"Yeah, I-I heard."
395,Rachel,I think it's great!
396,Rachel,"Ohh, I'm so happy for you!"
397,Chandler,"Oh, well, that's great!"
398,Joey,Yeah!
399,Joey,Yeah!
400,Monica,I can't believe you're getting married!

4,Phoebe,Well it's justit's one of those situations that I just hate.
5,Phoebe,Y'know?
6,Phoebe,A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.
7,Joey,Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him.
8,Phoebe,No!
9,Phoebe,No!
10,Phoebe,It's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
11,Chandler,I'll give up my ticket.
12,Joey,Me too.
13,Phoebe,Okay that's so generous!
14,Chandler,And I think Ross is generous too.
15,Phoebe,Great!
16,Phoebe,Okay then it's just us girls!
17,Phoebe,Monica and
18,Rachel,Great.
19,Phoebe,Yeah.
20,Rachel,So what-what is the exhibit.

22,Joey,Oh man!
23,Ross,Hey!
24,Rachel,Hi!
25,Chandler,Hey!
26,Joey,Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!
27,Ross,Thanks?
28,Ross,But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
29,Monica,Oh that's great!
30,Ross,Yeah.
31,Monica,I mean think about all the money that you're gonna make!
32,Ross,Why?
33,Ross,What?
34,Monica,"Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?"
35,Ross,"No, no, that's funny."
36,Ross,"But maybe it's time to move on, let it go, y'know?"
37,Ross,Stop it!
38,Ross,"Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth's father, so ah, he's much older than she is."
39,Ross,"Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils, huh?"
40,Rachel,I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
41,Ross,"Okay, okay."
42,Ross,"Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings  in his ear."
43,Chandler,Ross.
44,Ross,"Oh, come on you guys; that's funny!"
45,Ross,Y'know?
46,Ross,"Because he's needhe's got like a hearing aide y'know, cause-cause y'know, cause he's all old, and"
47,Ross,Really?
48,Ross,"That okay, that's great."
49,Ross,"All right look, I-I realize it upsets you."
50,Ross,"But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don't think there's really anything you can do about it."
51,Ross,Ohh!
52,Ross,A man with a plan!
53,Ross,Opening Credits
54,Phoebe,"Oh, this is so exciting!"
55,Phoebe,You get your picture back up on the wall of fame!
56,Phoebe,Eek!
57,Joey,I know.
58,Joey,It was so cool when I was up there before.
59,Joey,Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin' up about something Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down.
60,Joey,Now he's just laughing at me.
61,Joey,"Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I'll"
62,Phoebe,"Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer."

89,Rachel,"Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned."
90,Phoebe,Oh wow.
91,Phoebe,"What, do you think maybe he's gonna tell you that he's gay?"
92,Rachel,What?!
93,Rachel,No!
94,Rachel,Why?
95,Phoebe,No reason!
96,Phoebe,"That would just be a really big surprise, right?"
97,Phoebe,The Museum
98,Rachel,I didn't know you could get married here.
99,Monica,"This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there!"
100,Monica,I mean you'd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch.
101,Monica,The Museum
102,Rachel,Oh sorry didn't mean to interrupt.
103,Rachel,It's just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
104,Rachel,The Museum
105,Rachel,"Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list"
106,Monica,What?!
107,Monica,Are you crazy?!
108,Monica,I'm not getting married!
109,Monica,I'm not even engaged.
110,Phoebe,"Yeah, but there's a two-year wait."
111,Phoebe,And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place.
112,Phoebe,That's four years.
113,Phoebe,Chandler's not gonna wait that long.
114,Phoebe,"He's gonna find somebody else, y'know?"
115,Phoebe,"Someone, someone who did put their name on the list."
116,Rachel,"Yeah hon, it can't hurt to put your name down!"
117,Rachel,I mean in if two years if you're not engaged you just don't use it.
118,Monica,"Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down."
119,Rachel,I'm gonna do it too!
120,Phoebe,Me too!
121,Rachel,Really?
122,Rachel,"Who would, who would you marry?"
123,Phoebe,"I don't know, I don't have anyone right now."
124,Phoebe,Y'know?
125,Rachel,Oh Pheebs.
126,Phoebe,Don't feel too sorry for me.

308,Monica,I'm so sorry.
309,Monica,"Please, stop freaking out."
310,Chandler,I'm not freaking out.
311,Chandler,Why would I be freaking out?
312,Chandler,"A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday."
313,Monica,"Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun!"
314,Monica,"I mean, what's the harm in that?"
315,Chandler,Right here!

320,Monica,It was a mistake.
321,Monica,"Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't."
322,Chandler,Okay.
323,Monica,Really?
324,Chandler,"Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready"
325,Monica,I know!
326,Monica,I know.
327,Chandler,Okay.
328,Monica,I'm gonna go tell Joey that  that you're back.
329,Monica,I was really worried about you.
330,Phoebe,"Hey, did she buy it?"
331,Chandler,Totally.
332,Phoebe,So did Heldi show you the place?
333,Chandler,"Yeah, it's beautiful."
334,Phoebe,I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you!
335,Chandler,I know.

90,Phoebe,"Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me."
91,Phoebe,Oh God.
92,Phoebe,"Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon?"
93,Phoebe,"And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?"
94,Phoebe,"OK, that makes no sense."
95,Phoebe,Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?
96,Phoebe,Oh.
97,Phoebe,Oh.
98,Chandler,"Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs."

115,Rachel,"Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies."
116,Rachel,Here are the ornaments your mom sent.
117,Monica,"Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough."
118,Joey,"Monica, pigeons learn faster that you."

306,Phoebe,Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
307,Joey,Uh-huh.
308,Phoebe,You guuuyys.
309,Joey,"And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth."
310,Ross,You got me a cola drink?
311,Chandler,"And, a lemon lime."
312,Ross,"Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater."
313,Chandler,And last but not least.
314,Joey,They're ribbed for your pleasure.
315,Joey,END
0,Ross,That commercial always makes me so sad.
1,Joey,"Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK."
2,Ross,I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
3,Phoebe,"I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin."
4,Monica,And the fact that they're both monkeys.
5,Ross,"Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away."
6,Rachel,"Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight."
7,Rachel,"I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding."
8,Ross,"Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it."
9,Chandler,"Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny."
10,Chandler,When I did it to my boss's hat.
11,Chandler,all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
12,Chandler,OPENING TITLES
13,Joey,"Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got."
14,Chandler,Rhythm?
15,Joey,"No, my first fan mail."
16,Monica,"'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.'"
17,Monica,Gosh.
18,Monica,"'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.'"
19,Monica,"Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'"
20,Rachel,"Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married."
21,Monica,"This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment."
22,Monica,"There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building."
23,Joey,"Oh my god, I got my very own stalker."
24,Ross,Hey guys.
25,Phoebe,"Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?"
26,Ross,"Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel."
27,Chandler,"You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion."
28,Rachel,"Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again."
29,Phoebe,"Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny."
30,Phoebe,"So everyone just laugh, now."
31,Phoebe,"I know, I know."
32,Phoebe,Hello.
33,Phoebe,Hi Rob Dohnen.
34,Phoebe,"Oh, wow."
35,Phoebe,"Oh, I would love to have kids."
36,Phoebe,"you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them."
37,Joey,"Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?"
38,Chandler,Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.
39,Chandler,Hello.
40,Joey,"Ah, the stalker."
41,Chandler,"Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea."
42,Chandler,"We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon."
43,Joey,Let's get out of here.
44,Chandler,The one time they're not home.
45,Joey,"OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met."
46,Chandler,That's how radio stars escape stalkers.
47,Joey,She's comin'.
48,Joey,"Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die."
49,Joey,Ready?
50,Chandler,"Wait, wait, wait."
51,Joey,Erica.
52,Ross,"Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year."
53,Ross,"He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel."
54,Ross,"Oh my God, what happened?"
55,Ross,I can't believe this.
56,Ross,"Well, ya know, someone should have called me."
57,Ross,Zoo dollars?
58,Phoebe,I know.
59,Monica,I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker.
60,Monica,"What i-, what is she like."
61,Chandler,"Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?"
62,Chandler,RACHEL AND
63,Monica,Yeah.
64,Chandler,"Well, she looks the exact opposite of that."
65,Rachel,And she's not crazy?
66,Chandler,"Oh no no no, she's a total wack job."
67,Chandler,"Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore."
68,Rachel,Oh my God.
69,Monica,"Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her?"
70,Monica,He can not persue this.
71,Chandler,"Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person."
72,Chandler,"I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love?"
73,Chandler,What're you lookin' at me for?
74,Chandler,He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
75,Phoebe,"No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous."
76,Phoebe,"So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear."
77,Phoebe,"I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups."
78,Phoebe,"Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen."
79,Phoebe,This is a huge responsibility.
80,Phoebe,What?
81,Phoebe,Are you gonna kiss me?
82,Ross,I was thinkin' about it.
83,Phoebe,"OK.  OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes."
84,Phoebe,"Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe"
85,Phoebe,"OK, um, I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK.  Now, grandma's a person who everyone likes, she bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike."
86,Phoebe,"But lately she hasn't been coming to dinner, And last time you saw her she looked so much thinner."
87,Phoebe,"Now, your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru, but the truth is she died and some day you will too."
88,Phoebe,La-la-la la la-la-la la la-la-la la...
89,Joey,Yeah it is.
90,Joey,what?
91,Joey,"Yeah, that was a tricky one."
92,Joey,"In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites."
93,Joey,No one.
94,Joey,"Good, otherwise my watch would fall off."
95,Joey,"Alright, just one."
96,Joey,"Wow, you're good at that."
97,Ross,"Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way."
98,Ross,"But, um, zoo dollars?"
99,Joey,"Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage."
100,Joey,"Alright, look, I got to tell you something."
101,Joey,But that's what...
102,Joey,Hey I-
103,Joey,"That's it, just hey."
104,Joey,"Like at the end of a dance, HEY!"
105,Joey,Hey.
106,Joey,He-hey.
107,Phoebe,There'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you.
108,Phoebe,But don't.
109,Phoebe,"Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody That's another thing that you don't wanna do."
110,Monica,Excellent!
111,Chandler,Very informative!
112,Rachel,Not at all inappropriate!
113,Phoebe,Thank you for coming everybody.
114,Phoebe,There're cookies in the back.
115,Phoebe,"Yay, I rock."
116,Phoebe,But.
117,Phoebe,I sense these things.
118,Phoebe,It was either but or butter.
119,Phoebe,I can do that.
120,Phoebe,Yeah.
121,Phoebe,Thinkin' about it.
122,Ross,"Buddy, my monkey?"
123,Ross,Oh my God.
124,Ross,But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.
125,Ross,"That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me."
126,Ross,That guy Lipson?
127,Ross,"No, I, I only know Lipson."
128,Ross,"Buddy, my monkey, my monkey."
129,Ross,Of course.
130,Ross,This is unbelievable.
131,Ross,Are you trying to get me to bribe you?
132,Ross,But you already told me everything.
133,Ross,"Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey."
134,Rachel,"Well, so what're you gonna do?"
135,Ross,"Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is."
136,Chandler,That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.
137,Phoebe,"OK, hi again."
138,Phoebe,Today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals.
139,Phoebe,"Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo, Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo."
140,Phoebe,"Then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up, And that's how we get hamburgers."
141,Phoebe,"Nooowww, chickens!"
142,Ross,"Well, there goes my whole belief system."
143,Joey,"Oh my God, quick turn off the TV."
144,Rachel,"No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens."
145,Joey,"Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out."
146,Rachel,"Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?"
147,Monica,"Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon."
148,Joey,"Hey Erica, c'mon in."
149,Joey,"Right, they uh, they choppered me in."
150,Joey,What's up?
151,Joey,Who?
152,Joey,"It's not what you think, that was..."
153,Joey,"Alright look, that's it."
154,Joey,"I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright."
155,Joey,"Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK."
156,Joey,"I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor."
157,Joey,I just pretend to be a doctor.
158,Joey,Somebody wanna help me out here?
159,Rachel,"Oh, I know, I know."
160,Joey,'Cause it's a television show.

162,Ross,"That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin."
163,Rachel,"Yes, yes it is true."
164,Rachel,"And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me."
165,Monica,"And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't."
166,Chandler,"And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard."
167,Joey,"Yes, I'm afraid it is."
168,Joey,You deserve much better than me Erica.
169,Joey,"You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with."
170,Joey,"Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you."

193,Phoebe,la la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
194,Ross,"This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year."

236,Chandler,Thank God I don't do that anymore.
237,Monica,"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God."
238,Rachel,What what what what?
239,Monica,Jean-Claude Van Damme.
240,Monica,"I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot."
241,Rachel,Ya think?

256,Rachel,VAN
257,Rachel,"I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute?"
258,Rachel,"OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here."
259,Rachel,"Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute."
260,Rachel,So what should I tell her?
261,Rachel,VAN
262,Chandler,"No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows."
263,Chandler,OK that's not what he was doing.
264,Chandler,"Alright, he was looking for his bus money."
265,Chandler,"Oh uh, o, OK."
266,Chandler,"Well, uh, let's try one more."
267,Chandler,"there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock."
268,Chandler,No one was around to hear that?
269,Monica,So what'd he say?
270,Rachel,"Agh, what a jerk."
271,Rachel,I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out.
272,Rachel,"I mean, naturally, you know, I said no."
273,Monica,"Well, thanks anyway."
274,Rachel,"He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking."
275,Monica,"Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can."
276,Monica,Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...
277,Rachel,"Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight."
278,Rachel,Thank you.
279,Rachel,And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.
280,Joey,"Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of."
281,Joey,"no guys around, huh."
282,Rachel,Does anybody need anything?
283,Monica,"Oh, I'll have an espresso."
284,Monica,"Oh acutally, I'll get it."
285,Monica,"If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself."
286,Rachel,That is so unfair.
287,Phoebe,I know.
288,Phoebe,"Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme."
289,Ross,"Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer."
290,Ross,He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.
291,Joey,You're blowin' me off for a monkey?
292,Ross,"Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday."
293,Joey,"Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons."
294,Chandler,"Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done."
295,Phoebe,Stick a fork what?
296,Chandler,"Like, when you're cooking a steak."
297,Phoebe,"Oh, OK, I don't eat meat."
298,Chandler,"Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?"
299,Phoebe,"Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell."
300,Chandler,"OK, then, eat me, I'm done."
301,Chandler,I've met the perfect woman.
302,Chandler,"OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'"
303,Monica,What did you say?
304,Chandler,"Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'."
305,Chandler,"I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?"
306,Phoebe,"Oh, you just know."
307,Chandler,"Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops."
308,Chandler,"Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there."
309,Chandler,You want me to wear your panties?
310,Chandler,"Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?."
311,Chandler,You're swell.
312,Ross,"OK, got the music, got the dinner."

324,Ross,"Yeah OK, OK. OK, OK, bye."
325,Phoebe,"OK, Rachel, why don't you start talking first."
326,Rachel,"Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified."
327,Rachel,"She gave me the green light, I did nothing but-."
328,Rachel,Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?
329,Phoebe,"Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share..."
330,Monica,"Ya know, you had no right to go out with him."
331,Rachel,That is the most ridiculous.
332,Monica,You sold me out.
333,Rachel,I did not sell you out.
334,Monica,Yes you did.
335,Monica,Absolutely.
336,Rachel,Would you let me talk.

215,Monica,What is going on with you?
216,Monica,Since when are you so crazy about babies?
217,Chandler,I'm not crazy about babies.
218,Chandler,I'm crazy about us.
219,Monica,What?
220,Chandler,"Look, we've always talked about having babies someday."
221,Chandler,"I'm not saying it has to be right now, but I'm starting to think that we can handle it."
222,Chandler,We're good.
223,Chandler,We're really good.
224,Monica,We are pretty good.
225,Chandler,But nothing has to happen until your ready.
226,Monica,Well maybe I'm ready now.
227,Monica,"I mean, it's a little scary, but maybe it's right."
228,Chandler,What?!
229,Chandler,It's not right!
230,Chandler,We're not ready to have a kid now!
231,Monica,What?!
232,Chandler,I'm kidding.
233,Chandler,This is going to be fun.
234,Monica,So we're gonna try?
235,Monica,"I mean, are we trying?"
236,Chandler,We're trying to get pregnant.
237,Chandler,Y'know I'm not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies.
238,Chandler,"So, when do you want to start trying?"
239,Monica,"Okay, hold on a sec."
240,Chandler,Period math?
241,Monica,Yeah.
242,Chandler,Yeah.

247,Monica,Maybe here.
248,Chandler,"Wait a minute, it's perfect."
249,Chandler,We got a lot of time to kill and we're in a building that's full of beds!
250,Monica,And it's so clean!!
251,Monica,Commercial Break
252,Joey,Come on you stupid machine!
253,Joey,Come on!

259,Joey,Hey I got one!
260,Joey,I got one!
261,Phoebe,Hi.
262,Phoebe,Oh down please.
263,Phoebe,I-I hate to be a ball buster can I just do it?
264,Phoebe,Sure!
265,Phoebe,I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.
266,Phoebe,"Well, it's a long story."
267,Phoebe,It's kind of embarrassing.
268,Phoebe,Let's just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual.
269,Phoebe,How about you?
270,Phoebe,Oh.
271,Phoebe,"Uh-huh, yeah."
272,Phoebe,Oh yeah!
273,Phoebe,I-I would like that.

275,Phoebe,What?!
276,Phoebe,No!!
277,Phoebe,Elevator!!
278,Phoebe,No!
279,Joey,"Uh, you gotta press the button."
280,Ross,The nurse said they're bringing in another woman.
281,Rachel,"Ugh, is she pregnant yet?"
282,Rachel,She doesn't need to be; she'll still have the baby before I do.
283,Rachel,"Oh Ross, another contraction!"
284,Ross,That's it.
285,Ross,That's it.
286,Rachel,Yeah it was.
287,Phoebe,Excuse me?
288,Phoebe,Could you help me with something?
289,Phoebe,The patient I'm looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair.
290,Phoebe,"And umm, he's like early to mid-thirties, very attractive."
291,Phoebe,Oh yay!
292,Phoebe,Great!
293,Phoebe,"Okay, what room number is he in?"
294,Joey,"Uh, she's with me."
295,Joey,Dr. Drake Remoray.
296,Joey,Remoray.
297,Joey,It's Portuguese.
298,Joey,We need that information; I'm a doctor.
299,Joey,Damnit woman we're losing precious time!
300,Joey,Now do you want this man's blood on your head?
301,Phoebe,Hands.
302,Joey,Hands!
303,Joey,It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in.
304,Joey,"He's a patient of mine, I've been treating him for years!"
305,Joey,"816, thank you!"
306,Phoebe,Thank you.
307,Joey,And what is his name?
308,Phoebe,No!
309,Monica,I think we found a place.
310,Chandler,Okay.
311,Monica,"Umm, wait!"
312,Monica,Do you want to set the mood a little?
313,Chandler,Okay.
314,Chandler,"Uh, we'll dim the lights, dim the lights."
315,Chandler,Or turn them out all together.
316,Chandler,"Uh, no scented candles."
317,Chandler,Okay here.

325,Monica,Oh right!
326,Chandler,"Yes, 98.6."
327,Chandler,You're gonna be fine.
328,Phoebe,"Ooh, this is it!"
329,Phoebe,"Oh, that's him!"
330,Phoebe,That's him!
331,Joey,Great!
332,Joey,Go get him.
333,Phoebe,"Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first."
334,Joey,He's not really my type.
335,Phoebe,"No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray."
336,Phoebe,You can ask him questions and see what's he like.
337,Phoebe,People tell doctors everything.
338,Joey,But you said he was this great guy!
339,Phoebe,"But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks."
340,Joey,You do attract some stinkers.
341,Rachel,"Dr. Long, I've been at this for seventeen hours!"
342,Rachel,"Three women have come and gone with their babies, you gotta give me some good news!"
343,Rachel,How many centimeters am I dilated?
344,Rachel,Eight?
345,Rachel,Nine?
346,Rachel,Dr.
347,Ross,Just three?!
348,Ross,I'm dilated three!
349,Ross,Dr.
350,Rachel,"Hey, y'know what?"
351,Rachel,I'm not waiting!
352,Rachel,I'm gonna push this baby out!
353,Rachel,I'm doing it!
354,Rachel,I mean it's what?
355,Rachel,Three centimeters?
356,Rachel,That's gotta be like this!
357,Ross,Actually it's more like this.
358,Rachel,Oh stupid metric system!
359,Rachel,Oh for the love of God!
360,Rachel,Woman Giving
361,Rachel,Oh come on!
362,Joey,Hi!
363,Joey,I'm Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.
364,Joey,"I know, but I'm a neurologist."
365,Joey,"And just to be on the safe side, Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me."
366,Joey,That was a test.
367,Joey,Good response.
368,Joey,"All right, full name."
369,Joey,Date of birth?
370,Joey,Age?
371,Joey,"I'm a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician."
372,Joey,Okay.
373,Joey,"And uh, are you married."
374,Joey,Oh really?
375,Joey,"So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?"
376,Joey,Yes.
377,Joey,Oh that's terrible.
378,Joey,I'm-I'm really sorry.
379,Joey,Hmm.
380,Joey,Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
381,Joey,Excellent!
382,Joey,Excellent!
383,Joey,"And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff y'know, sexually?"
384,Joey,"Oooh, wrong answer."
385,Rachel,Okay!
386,Rachel,Okay wait!
387,Rachel,You listen to me!
388,Rachel,You listen to me!
389,Rachel,"Since I have been waiting four women, that's four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies!"
390,Rachel,I'm next!
391,Rachel,It's my turn!
392,Rachel,It's only fair!
393,Rachel,And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I'm going to sue you!
394,Rachel,"Not this hospital, I'm going to sue you!"
395,Rachel,And my husband  he's a lawyer!
396,Ross,Uh Rach
397,Rachel,Go get back on that case honey!
398,Rachel,"Okay, well then bring her in."
399,Ross,And yet somehow it's true!
400,Ross,Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby's ears!
401,Ross,Really?
402,Rachel,Oh!
403,Ross,Oh there you go!
404,Rachel,I get it!
405,Rachel,Oh we-we didn't.
406,Ross,No-no.
407,Ross,We
408,Ross,"Um uhWe're-we're just having this baby together but uh, uh that's all."
409,Ross,"Uh well ummwe're just not in that place, y'know?"
410,Ross,But we're very excited about this.
411,Rachel,Just tell me how.
412,Ross,Sid you lucky deaf bastard.
413,Phoebe,What else?
414,Phoebe,What else?
415,Joey,"Uh, well he's 33."
416,Phoebe,Oh.
417,Phoebe,Ah-uh.
418,Joey,A widower.
419,Phoebe,Oh.
420,Joey,He seemed like a stand up guy.
421,Joey,"Oh, and he's not into anything weird sexually."
422,Phoebe,Enter Pheebs.
423,Chandler,Should we tell Rachel there's an empty private room right next door to hers?
424,Monica,"We could, or we can have sex in it."
425,Chandler,"Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!"
426,Monica,Okay mister!
427,Monica,Fertilize me!
428,Monica,Does that sound like Janice?
429,Chandler,"If it's not, then there's two of them."
430,Chandler,And that would mean it's the end of the world!
431,Monica,Hey!
432,Ross,Hey!
433,Chandler,Hi.
434,Rachel,Oh hi.
435,Monica,I can't believe this is taking so long.
436,Monica,How are you doing?
437,Rachel,Oh not bad.
438,Rachel,Do you know that feeling when you're trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?
439,Chandler,Weirdest thing.
440,Chandler,Did I hearMother of God it's true!
441,Chandler,Jan-Janice!
442,Ross,"Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything."
443,Chandler,Janice I didn't even know you were pregnant!
444,Chandler,Who's the unwitting human who's essence you've stolen?
445,Chandler,What?
446,Chandler,That's funny.
447,Chandler,Does it-does it hurt?
448,Chandler,Does the labor hurt?
449,Phoebe,"Okay I've got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?"
450,Phoebe,Somebody went to college.
451,Phoebe,Wow.
452,Phoebe,What is it?
453,Phoebe,I'm sorry.
454,Phoebe,"Oh, I'll get it."
455,Phoebe,"Relax, it's not like we're forking."
456,Rachel,Oh that's five Ross.
457,Rachel,Five women have had five babies!
458,Rachel,And I have had no babies!
459,Rachel,Why doesn't she want to come out?
460,Ross,Y'know what I think it is?
461,Ross,I think you've made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn't want to leave.
462,Rachel,Oh.
463,Rachel,Look at you making up crap for me.
464,Rachel,Oh God!
465,Rachel,Dr.
466,Rachel,Doctor you gotta do something!
467,Rachel,I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.
468,Rachel,Dr.
469,Rachel,What?
470,Rachel,Dr.
471,Rachel,My God.
472,Rachel,Okay.
473,Rachel,Ha-ha-ha beat ya!
474,Rachel,Sucker!
475,Phoebe,Y'know what?
476,Phoebe,This one is.
477,Phoebe,Huh.
478,Phoebe,"Okay, Mr. Perkazet."
479,Phoebe,"Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?"
480,Joey,Rachel's having her baby!!
481,Joey,"Which is of no interest to me, I'm a neurologist."
482,Phoebe,Okay.
483,Phoebe,Okay.
484,Phoebe,IOkay ummthisI-I sent my friend Joey in here to find out stuff about you.
485,Phoebe,"Umm y'know, if it helps you came off great."
486,Phoebe,A lot better than I'm coming off right now.
487,Joey,Fake?
488,Joey,Excuse me?
489,Joey,Hello?
490,Phoebe,"You're right, that was wrong."
491,Phoebe,I'm sorry.
492,Phoebe,I'm so sorry.
493,Phoebe,It's just that I liked you so much.
494,Phoebe,"Can we just, can we just start over?"
495,Joey,"Uh, if I may?"
496,Joey,"Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right?"
497,Joey,And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her.
498,Joey,"Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer."
499,Joey,"Uh, she gave birth to her brother's triplets."
500,Joey,Oh!
501,Joey,Oh!
502,Joey,Her-her twin sister used to do porn!
503,Phoebe,"Uh Joey, we're trying to dial down the crazy."
504,Joey,Right!
505,Phoebe,"Umm, look we don't, we don't really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between us."
506,Phoebe,And I don't know about you but that doesn't happen to me a lot.
507,Joey,Me neither.
508,Rachel,3-2-1 oh!!
509,Rachel,Dr.
510,Rachel,I can't.
511,Rachel,"I can't push anymore, I can't."

518,Ross,Oh my God!
519,Rachel,"Don't say, ""Oh my God!"""
520,Rachel,Oh my God what?
521,Ross,What is that?
522,Ross,Dr.
523,Ross,"Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads."
524,Rachel,Oh God.
525,Rachel,Is she gonna be okay?
526,Rachel,Dr.
527,Ross,Go!
528,Ross,Dr.
529,Rachel,"I'm sorry, I can't!"
530,Ross,Yes you can!

532,Ross,Hey!
533,Ross,Hey!
534,Ross,Come on!
535,Ross,You can!
536,Ross,I know you can do this!
537,Ross,Let's go!
538,Rachel,I can't.
539,Rachel,"Please, you do it for me."
540,Ross,No!
541,Ross,Come on let'sOne more time!
542,Ross,One final push!
543,Ross,Ready?

547,Rachel,Are you okay?
548,Ross,You have no idea how much this hurts.
549,Ross,Keep going!
550,Ross,Keep going!
551,Ross,Dr.
552,Ross,Oh!
553,Ross,Oh!
554,Ross,She's upside down but she's coming!

556,Rachel,Oh God!
557,Ross,Oh!
558,Ross,Oh my God oh!
559,Ross,Oh my God she's here.
560,Ross,Oh she'sshe's perfect.
561,Rachel,"Oh, she's so tiny."
562,Rachel,Where'd she go?
563,Ross,Oh it's okay.
564,Ross,They're just-they're just wrapping her up.
565,Rachel,Okay.
566,Rachel,"Well be careful with her, she's really tiny."
567,Rachel,Dr.
568,Rachel,Oh hey you.
569,Rachel,Thanks for coming out of me.
570,Rachel,I know.
571,Rachel,Oh.
572,Rachel,Yeah.
573,Rachel,"Oh, she's looking at me."
574,Rachel,Hi!
575,Rachel,I know you.
576,Rachel,Dr.
577,Rachel,"No, not yet."
578,Rachel,Dr.
579,Rachel,"Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green."
580,Rachel,Hello baby girl.
581,Rachel,Commercial Break
582,Phoebe,Can we come in?
583,Ross,"Oh, come in."
584,Phoebe,Hi!
585,Joey,There she is!
586,Phoebe,"Oh, she's so beautiful."
587,Rachel,Here.
588,Monica,Oh my God!
589,Monica,She's amazing.
590,Monica,"Oh, oh I'm so glad you guys got drunk and had sex!"
591,Chandler,"It's incredible, I mean one minute she's inside you and then 47 hours later here she is."
592,Joey,She looks so real!
593,Joey,Y'know what I mean!
594,Joey,She's this whole tiny little person.
595,Joey,She already has eyelashes and knees anduh-oh.
596,Rachel,What?
597,Joey,"Oh no-no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand so we're good."
598,Phoebe,"Okay, my turn."
599,Phoebe,My turn.
600,Phoebe,Oh!
601,Phoebe,You're so cute!
602,Phoebe,"Oh, I could squeeze your little head!"
603,Phoebe,I won't.
604,Monica,What's the matter?
605,Rachel,"Oh nothing I Sorry, I just can't stop crying."
606,Ross,The doctor says it's completely normal with all the hormones.
607,Ross,"Plus, you-you're sleep deprived."
608,Rachel,So?
609,Rachel,You guys are all sleep deprived.
610,Rachel,I don't see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet.
611,Rachel,Oh God.
612,Joey,What's the matter now?
613,Rachel,I was reliving it.
614,Phoebe,Ohhh.
615,Chandler,"So, do you know what you're gonna call her yet?"
616,Phoebe,"Oh, wait a minute it's not gonna be Baby Girl?"
617,Phoebe,I thought that was so original!
618,Ross,"Uh actually, we-we've narrowed it down to two names."
619,Rachel,"Yeah, and y'know what?"
620,Rachel,"I love them both, so why don't you just pick one and that'll be it."
621,Ross,Wow!
622,Ross,"Umm, okay uheveryonethisis Isabella."
623,Ross,What?
624,Rachel,That's not her name!
625,Rachel,"I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel like an Isabella."
626,Chandler,So then I guess Ferdinad is out.
627,Joey,What was the other one Ross?
628,Ross,"Umm, Delilah."
629,Rachel,Oh great!
630,Rachel,Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
631,Ross,"So I guess we're back to uh, Baby Girl."
632,Phoebe,Yay!
633,Rachel,Well what are we going to do?
634,Monica,"It's okay honey, you'll find a name."
635,Ross,"Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be."
636,Chandler,You do?
637,Monica,"Yeah, I've had them picked out since I was fourteen."
638,Chandler,"Oh no, it's gonna be named after some snack or baked good isn't it?"
639,Rachel,Well tell us!
640,Rachel,What are they?
641,Monica,"Umm, okay."
642,Monica,If it's a boy it's Daniel.
643,Rachel,And if it's a girl?
644,Monica,I don't want to say.
645,Rachel,"Oh, just tell us!"
646,Rachel,We're not gonna want it!
647,Monica,Okay.
648,Monica,It's Emma.
649,Rachel,Emma!
650,Rachel,See?
651,Rachel,I don't want it.
652,Monica,Take it.
653,Rachel,What?
654,Monica,It's clearly an Emma.
655,Rachel,"Oh honey, but you love that name."
656,Monica,"Yeah, but I love you more."
657,Monica,"Besides y'know, nothing goes with Bing."
658,Monica,So I'm screwed.
659,Monica,"I mean  Oh, hi Emma."
660,Monica,"Yeah, that's you."
661,Monica,You're our little Em.
662,Monica,Oh what's that honey?
663,Monica,What?
664,Monica,"Oh, you want a little cousin?"
665,Monica,You want a cousin right now?
666,Chandler,That was amazing.
667,Monica,I know.
668,Monica,"Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever?"
669,Monica,We may have just started a family.
670,Monica,"Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby."
671,Chandler,"And if not, we got to do it on a bucket."
672,Rachel,Ohhh!
673,Rachel,Wow!
674,Rachel,He kinda takes your breath away doesn't he?
675,Rachel,"Oh, I'm fine."
676,Rachel,"Oh, I'm not doing it alone."
677,Rachel,I have Ross.
678,Rachel,"Well then he gets a divorce, it's Ross!"
679,Rachel,Well IThat's never gonna happen with Ross.
680,Rachel,Really?
681,Rachel,Well That'sy'knowThat'sWe've been alone for the last twenty minutes we're doing okay.
682,Rachel,Besides y'know what?
683,Rachel,"I-IMaybe we won't be alone, cause lately I-Ithings have been happening between me and Ross, y'know?"
684,Rachel,"Right before I went into labor, we-we had this kiss."
685,Rachel,Y'know?
686,Rachel,So it might be thethe beginning of something.
687,Ross,Hey Janice!
688,Ross,Who's this little guy?
689,Ross,No-no.
690,Ross,No.
691,Ross,Okay.
692,Ross,Man!
693,Ross,Did you see the kid on that nose?
694,Rachel,Uh-huh.
695,Rachel,"Y'know what I was, I was thinking about?"
696,Ross,Huh?
697,Rachel,Ummthat kiss before we left the apartment.
698,Rachel,That was some-something huh?
699,Ross,Yeah.
700,Ross,"Yeah, it really was."
701,Ross,But wewe gotta be careful.
702,Ross,"Wewe can't let that happen again, y'know?"
703,Rachel,Right.
704,Ross,I mean we don't want to go down that road do we?
705,Rachel,No!
706,Rachel,"No, of course not."
707,Rachel,No.
708,Rachel,That's why I brought it up.
709,Rachel,They didn't have any sodas?
710,Ross,Oh my God!
711,Ross,"I'm sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot."
712,Rachel,That's all right.
713,Rachel,And so it begins.
714,Phoebe,Is she in there?
715,Ross,Yeah.
716,Ross,"She's putting her down now, that's her."
717,Phoebe,Oh!
718,Ross,Look at Emma!
719,Phoebe,"I just can't decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?"
720,Ross,Oh what are you kidding?
721,Ross,"She's gorgeous, it's all Rachel."
722,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, for the last time, why aren't you two together again?"
723,Phoebe,"No, I know."
724,Phoebe,"I know, because you're not in that place."
725,Phoebe,"Which would be fine, except you totally are."
726,Ross,It'sit's complicated okay?
727,Phoebe,Yeah that's true.
728,Phoebe,"Yeah, you love her."
729,Phoebe,You always have.
730,Phoebe,You have a child together.
731,Phoebe,There is no right answer.
732,Ross,"Look, we've been together."
733,Ross,Okay?
734,Ross,"And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby."
735,Ross,It's just if-if we got together again and it didn't work outI could never do that to Emma.
736,Ross,I mean she-she thinking everything Oh that'snow me.
737,Ross,What do they put something in the water in this place?
738,Ross,"Since Rachel and I we're doing really, we're doing really well right now."
739,Phoebe,I know.
740,Phoebe,I know.
741,Phoebe,I know.
742,Phoebe,"I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it."
743,Ross,"Yeah, exactly."
744,Phoebe,Right.
745,Phoebe,Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were fifteen.
746,Joey,Hey.
747,Joey,I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here.
748,Joey,What's the matter?
749,Rachel,Nothing.
750,Joey,What is it?
751,Joey,Hey!
752,Rachel,Really it's nothing.
753,Rachel,I'm just
754,Joey,"Rach come on, what?"
755,Rachel,I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
756,Joey,What are you talking about alone?
757,Joey,What about Ross?
758,Rachel,"Oh please, he'll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs."
759,Joey,"Okay, how long was I watching that woman?"
760,Rachel,"I'm just saying that y'know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody andhe's gonna have his own life."
761,Rachel,Right?
762,Joey,"Yeah, I guess so."
763,Rachel,I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself.
764,Rachel,Pretty dumb huh?
765,Joey,"Hey, listen to me, listen to meyou are never ever gonna be alone."
766,Joey,Okay?
767,Joey,I promise that's not gonna happen.
768,Rachel,Joey.
769,Rachel,Honey what would I do without you?
770,Joey,You don't have to worry about that okay?
771,Rachel,"Oh, hon can you grab me my other box of tissues?"
772,Rachel,They're right on that chair under Ross's coat.
773,Joey,Sure.
774,Rachel,Okay.
775,Joey,My God.
776,Rachel,Joey.
777,Rachel,Oh my God.
778,Rachel,Okay.

1,Chandler,I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
2,Joey,No way!
3,Joey,"Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is."
4,Ross,"I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts."
5,Ross,They're craaazy.
6,Monica,Oh my God.
7,Monica,You guys!
8,Monica,You gotta come see this!
9,Monica,There's some creep out there with a telescope!
10,Ross,I can't believe it!
11,Ross,He's looking right at us!
12,Rachel,"Oh, that is so sick."
13,Chandler,I feel violated.
14,Chandler,And not in a good way.
15,Phoebe,How can people do that?...

19,Chandler,"I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time."
20,Chandler,It was unbelievable!
21,Chandler,"We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games..."
22,Monica,So have you called her yet?
23,Chandler,Let her know I like her?
24,Chandler,"What are you, insane?"
25,Chandler,It's the next day!
26,Chandler,How needy do I want to seem?

28,Chandler,Joey and
29,Ross,"Oh, yeah."
30,Ross,Yeah.
31,Ross,Let her dangle.
32,Monica,I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
33,Phoebe,"Oh, God, just do it!"
34,Phoebe,Call her!
35,Phoebe,Stop being so testosteroney!
36,Chandler,"Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat."
37,Chandler,I got her machine.
38,Joey,Her answer machine?
39,Chandler,"No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up."
40,Phoebe,"So, uh, why didn't you say anything?"
41,Chandler,"Oh, no-no-no-no."
42,Chandler,"Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase ""Yes indeedy-o."""
43,Monica,Look look!
44,Monica,It's Rachel and Barry.
45,Monica,"No, don't everybody look at once!"
46,Ross,"Okay, okay, what's going on?"
47,Phoebe,"Okay, they're just talking..."
48,Ross,"Yeah, well, does he look upset?"
49,Ross,Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
50,Phoebe,"No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!"
51,Ross,What?
52,Ross,What?
53,Ross,What?
54,Phoebe,That man across the street just kicked that pigeon!
55,Phoebe,Oh!
56,Chandler,"And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law."
57,Chandler,Hey Rach!
58,Monica,How'd it go?
59,Rachel,"Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great."
60,Rachel,"He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out..."
61,Phoebe,Not a good day for birds...
62,Rachel,"Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel..."
63,Ross,"That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?"
64,Rachel,"Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know?"
65,Rachel,"It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!"
66,Ross,"That's, that's nice twice!"
67,Monica,"Rachel, what's going on?"
68,Monica,I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
69,Joey,"Duh, where've you been?"
70,Rachel,"Yeah, but it was different with him today!"
71,Rachel,"And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know?"
72,Rachel,"I mean, we had fun!"
73,Rachel,Is there anything wrong with that?
74,Chandler,Yes!
75,Rachel,Why?
76,Chandler,I have my reasons.
77,Monica,"Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?"
78,Rachel,All right.
79,Rachel,"All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid!"
80,Rachel,"I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!"
81,Rachel,Wow... Wow!
82,Rachel,"I'm not crazy, right?"
83,Rachel,"I mean, it was never like that."
84,Rachel,"Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here..."
85,Chandler,"Oh, Danielle!"
86,Chandler,I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance.
87,Chandler,Bye-bye.
88,Chandler,Oh God!
89,Monica,That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?
90,Chandler,"Hey, I've been honing!"
91,Ross,What was with the dishes?
92,Chandler,"Oh, uh.."
93,Chandler,I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know?
94,Chandler,"I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours."
95,Monica,Look look!
96,Monica,"He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!"
97,Phoebe,Oh my God!
98,Phoebe,Go away!
99,Phoebe,Stop looking in here!
100,Monica,"Great, now he's waving back."
101,Joey,"Man, we gotta do something about that guy."
102,Joey,"This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment."
103,Joey,It creeps me out!
104,Joey,I feel like I can't do stuff!
105,Monica,What kinda stuff?
106,Joey,Will you grow up?
107,Joey,"I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked."
108,Phoebe,You cook naked?
109,Joey,"Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters."
110,Chandler,What are you looking at me for?
111,Chandler,I didn't know that.
112,Rachel,"Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good."
113,Rachel,"Well, what about Mindy?"
114,Rachel,"No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?"
115,Rachel,No.
116,Rachel,"No-no-no-no, no."
117,Rachel,"I mean, don't do that."
118,Rachel,"Not, I mean not for me."
119,Rachel,"Oh, Barry..!"
120,Rachel,"Come on, this is all way too.."
121,Rachel,I had a bra.
122,Rachel,What?
123,Chandler,Can I use your phone?
124,Monica,"Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone."
125,Chandler,"Yes, it's working!"
126,Chandler,Why isn't she calling me back?
127,Joey,Maybe she never got your message.
128,Phoebe,"Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet."
129,Chandler,Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
130,Ross,"...desperate, needy, pathetic?"
131,Chandler,"Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad."
132,Phoebe,How many beeps?
133,Chandler,She answered.
134,Monica,"Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about."
135,Chandler,"I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me."
136,Chandler,Now I'm needy and snubbed.
137,Chandler,"God, I miss just being needy."
138,Phoebe,How'd he take it?
139,Rachel,"Pretty well, actually..."
140,Monica,"Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?"
141,Rachel,"Oh, do I?"
142,Monica,Uh huh.
143,Rachel,We ended up having sex in his chair.
144,Monica,You had sex in his chair?!...
145,Monica,"I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?"
146,Ross,You-you had what?
147,Phoebe,Sex in his chair.
148,Ross,"What, uh... what were you thinking?"
149,Rachel,I don't know!
150,Rachel,"I mean, we still care about each other."
151,Rachel,There's a history there.
152,Rachel,'S'like you and Carol.
153,Ross,No!
154,Ross,"No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!"
155,Rachel,Please.
156,Rachel,"If she said to you, ""Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now,"" what would you say?"
157,Chandler,"If it helps, I could slide over."
158,Ross,"It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation!"
159,Ross,"It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go."
160,Phoebe,Where are you going?
161,Ross,"I just have to go, all right?"
162,Ross,Do I need a reason?
163,Ross,Huh?
164,Ross,"I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it."
165,Ross,Okay?
166,Chandler,Hello?
167,Chandler,Hello?
168,Rachel,Hello?
169,Rachel,Mindy!
170,Rachel,Hi!
171,Rachel,"Hey, how are you?"
172,Rachel,"Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great."
173,Rachel,Really?
174,Rachel,Oh.
175,Rachel,Okay.
176,Rachel,"Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and..."
177,Rachel,"Okay...  Great...  Great...  All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow!"
178,Rachel,Okay..
179,Rachel,Okay...  Bye.
180,Rachel,Oh God.
181,Rachel,Oh God.
182,Rachel,Oh God.
183,Chandler,So how's Mindy?
184,Rachel,"Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry...  Hi, it's me, I just.."
185,Rachel,Mindy!!
186,Rachel,Mindy!
187,Rachel,Hi!
188,Rachel,"No, I figured that's where you'd be!"
189,Rachel,Commercial Break
190,Monica,Brrrrrrr!
191,Chandler,Hell is filled with people like you.
192,Joey,He's back!
193,Joey,The peeper's back!
194,Joey,Get down!
195,Rachel,Get down?
196,Chandler,...And boogie!
197,Rachel,"Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy."
198,Monica,Relax.
199,Monica,"Y'know, she may not even know."
200,Rachel,Please.
201,Rachel,"I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me?"
202,Rachel,"I mean, what else is it about?"
203,Rachel,Oh!
204,Rachel,"She was my best friend, you guys!"
205,Rachel,We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..
206,Joey,Yeah?
207,Rachel,"And now, y'know, I'm like..."
208,Rachel,I'm like the other woman!
209,Rachel,I feel so..
210,Joey,..Naughty!
211,Rachel,"Right, I'll see you guys later..."
212,Joey,"Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you."
213,Joey,"Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or-  That's fine, yeah..."
214,Chandler,"Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom."
215,Chandler,Will you watch my phone?
216,Monica,Why don't you just take it with you?
217,Chandler,"Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?"
218,Monica,Why don't you just call her?
219,Chandler,"I can't call her, I left a message!"
220,Chandler,I have some pride.
221,Monica,Do you?
222,Chandler,No!
223,Chandler,"Danielle, hi!"
224,Chandler,"It's, uh, it's Chandler!"
225,Chandler,I'm fine.
226,Chandler,"Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone."
227,Chandler,"Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great."
228,Chandler,Okay.
229,Chandler,"She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back."
230,Chandler,"She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back..."
231,Monica,Don't you have to pee?
232,Chandler,'S'why I'm dancing...
233,Rachel,Mindy.
234,Rachel,"Hey, you...."
235,Rachel,"So, what's up?"
236,Rachel,Sure we should...
237,Rachel,So.
238,Rachel,Okay.
239,Rachel,Of course!
240,Rachel,Was that all you wanted to ask me?
241,Rachel,Ohhhh!!
242,Rachel,...What?
243,Rachel,What?
244,Rachel,Oh sure it is!
245,Rachel,"Um, what- what would make you think that?"
246,Rachel,Really.
247,Rachel,"Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too."
248,Rachel,What?
249,Rachel,What's what you were afraid of?
250,Rachel,What?
251,Rachel,"Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid."
252,Rachel,"Oh, we are both so stupid."
253,Rachel,Smell familiar?
254,Rachel,"Oh, I am so sorry."
255,Joey,Oh my.
256,Ross,Four
257,Chandler,"Ring dammit, ring!"
258,Ross,Thanks.
259,Joey,"Hey, you know our phone's not working?"
260,Chandler,What?
261,Joey,"I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer."
262,Chandler,I turned it off.
263,Chandler,"Mother of God, I turned it off!"
264,Monica,Just like you told her you did!
265,Monica,... Just pointing out the irony.
266,Joey,"Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name!"
267,Joey,Can I use the phone?
268,Chandler,Nngghhh!!!!!!
269,Joey,Can I use your phone?
270,Joey,"Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please."
271,Ross,"""Heating device."""
272,Phoebe,Radiator.
273,Ross,Five letters.
274,Phoebe,Rdtor.
275,Joey,"Yeah, is Sidney there?"
276,Joey,"Oh, this is?"
277,Joey,Sidney's a woman.
278,Monica,So she's a woman!
279,Monica,So what?
280,Joey,Yeah.
281,Joey,"Yeah, so what?"
282,Joey,"Look, I live across the street,  and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay?"
283,Joey,"Yeah, I can see you right now!"
284,Joey,Hello!
285,Joey,"If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel likeThank you, but... that's not really the point..."
286,Joey,"The point is that...  Mostly free weights, but occasionally.."
287,Monica,Joey!
288,Joey,"Yeah, my neighbor...  Yeah, the brunette...  She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress."
289,Monica,The green dress?
290,Monica,Really?
291,Joey,"Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day."
292,Monica,Nooo!
293,Rachel,Hey.
294,Rachel,Got a second?
295,Rachel,"Uh, we are here to break up with you."
296,Rachel,"Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?"
297,Rachel,Even when we were having sex in that chair?
298,Rachel,Please!
299,Rachel,During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
300,Rachel,"Well, the first time didn't really count..."
301,Rachel,"I mean, y'know, 's'Barry."
302,Rachel,Okay.
303,Rachel,"Okay, we'll be here!"
304,Rachel,Hating you!
305,Rachel,Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there?
306,Rachel,"Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great."
307,Rachel,What are you talking about?!
308,Rachel,"Mindy, the guy is the devil!"
309,Rachel,He's Satan in a smock!
310,Rachel,Oh God.
311,Rachel,And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
312,Monica,You okay?
313,Rachel,Yeah.
314,Monica,Really?
315,Rachel,Yeah!
316,Rachel,"Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice."
317,Rachel,And now I know.
318,Monica,Aww...
319,Joey,Big day.
320,Joey,Closing Credits
321,Joey,"All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser."
322,Joey,"I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat..."
323,Phoebe,You know he's gay?
324,Ross,I just wanna clarify
325,Chandler,Danielle!
326,Chandler,Hi!
327,Chandler,"Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody."
328,Chandler,What are you doing here?
329,Chandler,"...I'm, I'm okay."
330,Chandler,That sounds good.
331,Chandler,"I'll call you- or you call me, whatever..."
332,Chandler,Okay.
333,Phoebe,Whoo-hoo!
334,Monica,"Yeah, there you go!"
335,Ross,Second date!
336,Chandler,...I dunno.
337,Rachel,You don't know?
338,Chandler,"Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay?"
339,Chandler,"I mean,... how needy is that?"
340,Chandler,End
0,Chandler,Hi!
1,Ross,Hey!
2,Monica,Hey!
3,Chandler,"We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio."
4,Phoebe,"Oh, right!"
5,Phoebe,Your adoption interview!
6,Monica,"Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby."
7,Joey,I can't believe it.
8,Joey,"When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby!"
9,Joey,That is so weird!
10,Chandler,And so incorrect!
11,Monica,She's only a couple of months pregnant.
12,Monica,She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.
13,Ross,"Come on, she's gonna love you guys!"
14,Chandler,"Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up."
15,Monica,And a lot could still get in our way.
16,Chandler,Yeah.
17,Chandler,"I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better.."
18,Phoebe,What are you gonna name the baby?
19,Chandler,I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.
20,Joey,"But just think, ok?"
21,Joey,What if everything goes right?
22,Joey,What if this woman does pick you guys?
23,Monica,Oh my God.
24,Monica,She's gonna pick us!
25,Chandler,So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
26,Monica,"You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't?"
27,Monica,"If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!"
28,Chandler,"Yes, but..."
29,Monica,"Oh my God, it's gonna WORK!"
30,Monica,We're gonna make it work!
31,Monica,I'm gonna be a mummy and  you're gonna be a daddy!
32,Monica,"All right, I'll see you suckers."
33,Monica,I'm gonna get me... A BABY!
34,Monica,{she leaves)
35,Chandler,"Oh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy!!"
36,Chandler,OPENING CREDITS
37,Rachel,"Hey, who's Phoebe with?"

39,Joey,Hey!
40,Phoebe,Hey!
41,Joey,So... who's your friend?
42,Phoebe,"Oh, that's Sarah."
43,Phoebe,"No, no."
44,Phoebe,"Don't you get any ideas, ok?"
45,Phoebe,"No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!"
46,Joey,"OW, why, why, why?"
47,Phoebe,"Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!"
48,Joey,"Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with."
49,Phoebe,Mandy.
50,Joey,"Mandy, uh?"
51,Joey,"Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?"
52,Phoebe,No.
53,Joey,"I know why I don't remember her, huh?"
54,Rachel,Do you think I'm someone else?
55,Joey,"Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really."
56,Joey,"Honest, Rach?"
57,Rachel,"Well, believe it or not, it's true."
58,Rachel,"When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful."
59,Rachel,He was thoughtful and mature.
60,Rachel,"And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!"
61,Joey,Growth!
62,Phoebe,"Fine, I'll give you her number."
63,Joey,"Ok, thank you."
64,Joey,And I promise you I will not forget this one.

68,Ross,Hey!
69,Rachel,Hi!
70,Ross,"Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice."
71,Rachel,Oh!
72,Ross,How does this look?
73,Rachel,"Well, it's a little low... pick up a little...  a little bit more...  a little bit more..."
74,Rachel,There you go!
75,Rachel,Now throw it away!
76,Ross,C'mon!
77,Ross,This looks good!
78,Rachel,"Ross, please, trust me."
79,Rachel,I buy 30 fashion magazines a month.
80,Rachel,"Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat."
81,Ross,Damnit!
82,Ross,I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!
83,Phoebe,"Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow."
84,Phoebe,"You're more than welcome to come with us, right?"
85,Ross,Really?
86,Ross,That would be great.
87,Ross,"I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress."
88,Joey,"I can see why, nice shirt!"
89,Ross,You're wearing the same shirt.
90,Joey,Stupid Gap on every corner!
91,Monica,"Ok, thank you."
92,Monica,"Uh, well this is it."
93,Monica,Are you OK?
94,Chandler,Yeah.
95,Chandler,"Just weird, you know."

99,Monica,Well... obviously!
100,Monica,Agency
101,Monica,Hi.
102,Monica,"It is so, so nice to meet you."
103,Chandler,Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
104,Chandler,Ok.
105,Chandler,That's what our friends call us.
106,Monica,I don't know about that.
107,Chandler,I don't think that's exactly...
108,Monica,"Let her finish, doctor."
109,Phoebe,Hey!
110,Joey,Hey.
111,Phoebe,"Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night."
112,Joey,Well...
113,Phoebe,Yeah!
114,Phoebe,So you're gonna call this one back?
115,Joey,Nope.
116,Phoebe,What are you talking about?
117,Phoebe,Sarah's great!
118,Joey,"Oh, really?"
119,Joey,You know what your great friend did?
120,Joey,"We're out to dinner, ok?"
121,Joey,"We're getting along, having a really nice time."
122,Joey,I was thinking she was really cool.
123,Joey,"And then, out of nowhere..."
124,Phoebe,That’s it?
125,Phoebe,That’s why you won’t go out with her again?
126,Phoebe,"So, she took some fries, big deal!"
127,Joey,"Hey, hey, look!"
128,Joey,It’s not about a few fries... it’s about what the fries represent.
129,Phoebe,What?
130,Joey,ALL FOOD!
131,Phoebe,"I’m sorry, I can’t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!"
132,Joey,"Hey, hey, hey, hey."
133,Joey,Look.
134,Joey,"I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants!"
135,Joey,"The more, the better!"
136,Joey,All right?
137,Joey,Just don’t order a Garden salad and then eat my food!
138,Joey,That’s a good way to lose some fingers!
139,Phoebe,Oh
140,Rachel,Hi
141,Phoebe,Thank God you’re here.
142,Phoebe,Listen to this!
143,Rachel,what?
144,Phoebe,Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...
145,Rachel,Oh!
146,Rachel,"Oh, no!"
147,Phoebe,What?
148,Phoebe,You know about the plate thing?
149,Rachel,"Oh, yeah."
150,Rachel,Joey doesn’t share food.
151,Rachel,"I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ..."
152,Phoebe,You wouldn’t let her have a grape?
153,Rachel,Oh no!
154,Rachel,Not me!
155,Rachel,Emma!
156,Joey,JOEY DOESN’T SHARE FOOD!
157,Phoebe,"Well, I still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again."
158,Phoebe,You are calling her!
159,Phoebe,"And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!"
160,Joey,I like that!
161,Joey,A sharing buffer!
162,Joey,Yeah!
163,Joey,I’ll order some extra fries!
164,Joey,Maybe a plate of onion rings.
165,Joey,Yeah.
166,Joey,And a shrimp cocktail.
167,Joey,And some buffalo wings.
168,Joey,"Maybe an individual pizza, uh?"
169,Joey,And some mozzarella sticks.
170,Joey,What were we talking about?
171,Phoebe,This place is awesome!
172,Ross,"You know, we should just go, I’m not gonna find anything here!"
173,Ross,This stuff is ridiculous!
174,Rachel,"Ah, this place is great!"
175,Phoebe,Wow!
176,Ross,"Rach, come on, I’m not gonna wear any of this!"
177,Ross,Nothing silver.
178,Ross,Ok?
179,Ross,Nothing with hair!
180,Ross,And nothing with padlocks on it!
181,Rachel,"Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater!"
182,Rachel,"I mean, this is just beautiful!"
183,Ross,"Wow, this is really soft ."
184,Ross,Three hundred and fifty dollars?
185,Rachel,"Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!"
186,Ross,Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.
187,Ross,Phoebe
188,Ross,Wow!
189,Phoebe,Yeah!
190,Ross,Actually this looks like pretty good!
191,Ross,Yeah!
192,Ross,Boys will be boys?
193,Phoebe,What?
194,Phoebe,They will be!
195,Ross,"All right, that’s it, I’m getting out of here."
196,Rachel,"No, no, no, no!"
197,Rachel,"Ross, wait!"
198,Rachel,Come on!
199,Rachel,"You know, there’s other stuff."
200,Rachel,"Here’s a nice shirt, look at these nice pants..."
201,Ross,"Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me."
202,Rachel,"Yes, they will!"
203,Rachel,You know what you should do?
204,Rachel,"Just go take a walk, all right?"
205,Rachel,I know your size and I’m... I’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.
206,Ross,Really?
207,Rachel,Yes!
208,Rachel,And I know what looks sexy on guys.
209,Rachel,"Please, just wear what I suggest, and she’s gonna go nuts for you."
210,Ross,"So, you’re saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?"
211,Rachel,Why do men keep talking to me like this?
212,Chandler,"So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?"
213,Monica,Amen.
214,Chandler,Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
215,Monica,"Uh, good hands."
216,Monica,Healing hands.
217,Monica,It says “Do it!”.
218,Monica,And behold she did adopt onto them a baby.
219,Monica,And it was good.
220,Chandler,"Yeah, wow."
221,Monica,"Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point."
222,Monica,Good flock.
223,Monica,"Flock, flock, flock."
224,Chandler,No-ot for me it doesn’t.
225,Chandler,Agency
226,Chandler,"Yeah, actually."
227,Chandler,"So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?"
228,Chandler,Agency
229,Chandler,You should be.
230,Chandler,You’re really on top of stuff.. Agency
231,Monica,We don’t?
232,Monica,"Oh my God, this is great!"
233,Monica,This is so great!
234,Monica,Did you hear that?
235,Chandler,"Yeah, I did."
236,Monica,"Hey, thank you."
237,Monica,Thank you so much.
238,Monica,You are SO going to Heaven!
239,Rachel,We got some really great stuff!
240,Phoebe,"Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got."
241,Rachel,Oh!
242,Rachel,Really?
243,Rachel,Do you wanna try some of them on for me?
244,Phoebe,Oh!
245,Phoebe,okay.
246,Phoebe,"Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?"
247,Rachel,Oh no!
248,Rachel,"I took one of Ross' bags by     mistake, and one of mine is missing."
249,Phoebe,"oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later."
250,Ross,So?
251,Ross,What do you think?
252,Joey,I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!
253,Ross,Yeah!
254,Ross,Yeah!
255,Ross,Rachel picked it out for me.
256,Ross,She told me to trust her and you know what?
257,Ross,I'm glad I did!
258,Ross,I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
259,Joey,"Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that."
260,Ross,"Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?"
261,Joey,Looks like someone IS the ladies!
262,Ross,You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off.
263,Ross,"Yeah, now if you'll excuse me  I have a date."
264,Ross,See?
265,Ross,ALL eyes on ME!
266,Chandler,We are NOT signing those papers.
267,Monica,Why not?
268,Chandler,It's wrong.
269,Chandler,They made a mistake.
270,Chandler,They think we're somebody else.
271,Monica,God works in mysterious ways.
272,Chandler,You have gotta stop!
273,Monica,But she liked us.
274,Chandler,She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
275,Monica,"Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend."
276,Monica,"I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor."
277,Chandler,"Your Veal Chop is $34,95!"
278,Monica,"C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity."
279,Monica,"I mean, the mistake has already been made."
280,Monica,They are writing up the paper right now.
281,Chandler,But we are not the one she chose!
282,Chandler,How can you feel okay about this?
283,Monica,Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.
284,Chandler,I know..
285,Monica,"I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby?"
286,Monica,"What if, what if no one ever picks us?"
287,Chandler,"oh, honey.."
288,Monica,"Please.. please, we are so close."
289,Chandler,"Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child."
290,Chandler,She deserves to know who it's going to.
291,Monica,"okay, right."
292,Chandler,"So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us."
293,Monica,Maybe she will.
294,Monica,Uh!
295,Monica,Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?
296,Chandler,You're Jewish.
297,Monica,Technicality!
298,Joey,"Oh, that looks great!"
299,Joey,Good ordering!
300,Joey,"oh, I didn't know you liked French fries."
301,Joey,Help yourself!
302,Joey,What's mine is yours.
303,Joey,"Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams."
304,Joey,"How about those fries though, huh?"
305,Joey,"You are beautiful, you know that?"
306,Joey,Oh  okay..
307,Joey,NOW look what you did!
308,Joey,"I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?"
309,Joey,"WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT!"
310,Joey,"I'm sorry, I'm overreacting."
311,Joey,"Okay, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, okay, I mean  There are things you do..and you now, things..  that you don't do ."
312,Ross,Oh!
313,Ross,You are gonna love it!
314,Ross,"and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this."
315,Ross,Here  So this was fun!
316,Joey,"I really am sorry about, you know..before."
317,Joey,I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you.
318,Joey,"Well, stuffed clams."
319,Joey,"Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake."
320,Joey,"So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to     be healthy."
321,Joey,"Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead."
322,Joey,"Oh yeah, sure."
323,Joey,No problem.
324,Joey,Sure I do.
325,Joey,Coule?
326,Joey,Really?
327,Joey,"Yeah, of course."
328,Joey,I can control myself.
329,Joey,Stop staring at me!
330,Joey,"Why, just a tiny little..."
331,Joey,Oh-oh!
332,Joey,TIME LAPSE
333,Joey,I'm not even sorry.
334,Chandler,Hey.
335,Chandler,Agency
336,Monica,I-Is... Is that a picture?
337,Monica,"Look, doctor!"
338,Monica,"Look, before we sign anything we really have to talk... We're not who you think we are."
339,Monica,Agency
340,Chandler,The agency must have made some mistake.
341,Chandler,My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.
342,Chandler,I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.
343,Chandler,Agency
344,Chandler,"Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler."
345,Chandler,We're from New York.
346,Monica,"Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby."
347,Monica,"Well, we...  ""bore false witness""... See I could be a reverend."
348,Monica,But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...
349,Monica,"Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file..."
350,Chandler,Erica wait!
351,Chandler,You have every reason to be upset.
352,Chandler,We did lie.
353,Chandler,But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long.
354,Chandler,Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
355,Chandler,"Erica, please."
356,Chandler,Just consider us.
357,Chandler,Ask them to see our file.
358,Chandler,Our last name's Bing.
359,Chandler,My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.
360,Chandler,But you did like us.
361,Chandler,And you should.
362,Chandler,My wife's an incredible woman.
363,Chandler,She's loving and devoted and caring.
364,Chandler,And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right...
365,Chandler,I love my wife more than anything in this world.
366,Chandler,And I...
367,Chandler,It kills me that I can't give her a baby...
368,Chandler,I really want a kid.
369,Chandler,"And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad."
370,Chandler,But my wife... she's already there.
371,Chandler,She's a mother... without a baby...
372,Chandler,Please?
373,Chandler,You still want that baby?
374,Monica,God bless you Chandler Bing!
375,Monica,COMMERCIAL BREAK

2,Ross,"Check out what this one student wrote, ""I loved Dr. Geller's class."
3,Ross,Mind blowing lectures!
4,Ross,"Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"""
5,Chandler,"Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there's a big selling calendar, eh?"
6,Rachel,Who wrote it?
7,Ross,"Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous."
8,Joey,"Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?"
9,Ross,Yeah.
10,Joey,"Oh, cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer."
11,Chandler,A hot girl's at stake and all of the sudden he's Rain Man.
12,Rachel,"Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?"
13,Ross,It's a girl!
14,Ross,"Anyway, it wouit wouldn't matter."
15,Ross,Okay?
16,Ross,Because I'm a teacher and she's a student.
17,Chandler,"Oh, is that against the rules?"
18,Ross,"No, but it is frowned upon."
19,Chandler,I see.
20,Ross,"Besides, there's a big age difference."
21,Joey,"Oh, well think of it like this, when you're 90"
22,Ross,I know when I'm 90 she'll be like 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.
23,Joey,No that's not what I was going to say at all.
24,Joey,"No, what I was going to say is when you're 90 you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old."
25,Joey,Opening Credits
26,Joey,Hey Chandler!
27,Joey,Y'know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
28,Chandler,"Oh yeah, Dana Keystone."
29,Chandler,She was in my Movement class.
30,Phoebe,What's a Movement class?

32,Joey,"Oh well listen, anyway she's directing the new Al Pacino movie."
33,Joey,You gotta get me an audition!
34,Chandler,"Oh, I don't know man."

177,Monica,"So, now you're going on a date with this girl?"
178,Chandler,"Honey, it is not a date!"
179,Chandler,I haven't talked to her in ten years!
180,Chandler,You can't just call up somebody you haven't talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor.
181,Chandler,"There are rules, y'know?"
182,Chandler,"You gotta, you got to put in some time."
183,Monica,"You're right, I'm sorry."
184,Monica,"It's not like you're y'know, going out with an ex-girlfriend."
185,Chandler,"No, we only went out once."

199,Monica,I know!
200,Monica,"Now look, there's only one problem though."
201,Monica,"There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's."
202,Phoebe,"Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess  you should get to stay here."
203,Rachel,Hey!
204,Rachel,"Hey-hey, now this was no one's fault Pheebs."
205,Rachel,Okay?
206,Rachel,It was an accident.
207,Phoebe,"Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room."
208,Rachel,Okay!

220,Ross,Of course I did!
221,Ross,"You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson."
222,Ross,"Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone's name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames."
223,Ross,Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
224,Ross,"Umm, no."
225,Ross,No.
226,Ross,"Umm, it's Cutie McPretty."
227,Ross,"Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I'm having a great time!"
228,Ross,"Y'know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it's not."
229,Ross,I mean it's not at all.
230,Ross,Burt!
231,Phoebe,So did you sleep well last night?
232,Rachel,I did.

257,Phoebe,Thanks Monica!
258,Monica,Does that smell bother you?
259,Phoebe,What the smell from Joey's?
260,Phoebe,"No, I can hardly smell it over here."
261,Monica,"Well you let me know if you can, because y'know I can bake a pie to cover it."
262,Phoebe,"I can smell it a little, bake the pie."
263,Monica,Okay!
264,Phoebe,Okay.
265,Monica,Hello?
266,Monica,"Oh yes, one minute please."

269,Phoebe,Oh!
270,Phoebe,Hello?
271,Phoebe,Yeah this is Phoebe.
272,Phoebe,Really?
273,Joey,"Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair straightener that started the fire."
274,Joey,"No-no, it was the candles."
275,Joey,It's very not good leaving candles unattended.
276,Joey,"In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is  Uhh Uhh Okay."
277,Joey,"Well, I have to go now."
278,Ross,We had such a great time!
279,Ross,She's-she's incredible!
280,Ross,"I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't."
281,Ross,It wasn't at all.
282,Ross,Elizabeth is very mature for her age.
283,Ross,A concept lost on some people!
284,Monica,So it's okay to date a student.
285,Ross,"Well, not really."
286,Ross,"I mean technically it's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon."
287,Ross,"Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou."
288,Monica,"Well Ross, you be careful now."
289,Monica,You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents.
290,Ross,Yeah.
291,Ross,What-what should I do?
292,Joey,"Well Ross, it seems pretty clear."
293,Joey,I mean what's more important?
294,Joey,"What people think or how you feel, huh?"
295,Joey,"Ross, you gotta follow your heart."
296,Monica,Joey that is so sweet.
297,Chandler,Hey.
298,Joey,Hey-hey-hey!
299,Joey,"So, how did it go with Dana?"

338,Phoebe,I'm still full from your homemade potato chips.
339,Monica,But you should eat them now because they're hot from the oven.
340,Phoebe,Okay.

365,Ross,What do you want to do now?
366,Ross,Huh?

179,Phoebe,"Yeah, I do."
180,Phoebe,What's the matter?
181,Rachel,I'm just bummed about the way I left things with Ross.
182,Rachel,I shouldn't have lied to him about having to work.
183,Rachel,He seemed so mad at me.
184,Phoebe,"Eh, don't be so hard on yourself."
185,Phoebe,If someone I was still in love with was getting married

194,Rachel,"Phoebe, I'm going to Ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable."
195,Rachel,"Not because, I'm still in love with him!"
196,Rachel,"I mean, hey, y'know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y'know?"
197,Rachel,"Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love!"
198,Rachel,"I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross."
199,Rachel,Yeah!
200,Rachel,"But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that I'm still in love with him."

202,Rachel,"I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love himOhh!"
203,Rachel,Oh my God!

205,Phoebe,We thought you knew!
206,Rachel,We?
207,Phoebe,"Yeah, we all know!"
208,Phoebe,We talk about it all the time!
209,Rachel,You all know?
210,Rachel,Does Ross know?
211,Phoebe,"Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything."
212,Rachel,"Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!"
213,Phoebe,"Well, because we thought you knew!!"
214,Phoebe,It's so obvious!
215,Phoebe,"God, that would be like telling Monica, ""Hey, you like things clean."""
216,Joey,Hey!
217,Joey,The
218,Joey,Check this out?
219,Joey,Huh?
220,Joey,Yeah.

222,Joey,What do you think?
223,Chandler,"Well, I don't have to buy that, ""I'm with stupid"" T-shirt anymore."
224,Joey,"Well, I like it."
225,Joey,Here you go.
226,Chandler,"All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you?"
227,Chandler,Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
228,Joey,"Oh, I embarrass you?"
229,Chandler,How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
230,Chandler,The
231,Chandler,Oh really?
232,Chandler,Then how come no one here is wearing them?
233,Chandler,The
234,Chandler,"All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself."
235,Joey,Oh yeah?
236,Joey,If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat?
237,Joey,I choose the hat.
238,Joey,The

241,Chandler,"All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here."
242,Chandler,I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
243,Ross,Hey!
244,Ross,"I just spoke to your dad, and you know what?"
245,Ross,He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
246,Ross,Whoa-whoa-what?
247,Ross,You found a place?
248,Ross,She said what?
249,Ross,Postpone it?
250,Ross,"Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding?"
251,Ross,"Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?"
252,Ross,This isn't right.
253,Ross,I can't ask people to do that?
254,Ross,Would you ask people to do that?
255,Ross,The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option.
256,Ross,This is when we're getting married.
257,Ross,No.
258,Ross,I'm saying it's now.
259,Ross,There's no or' in mind.
260,Ross,What is wrong with these pants?!
261,Ross,"No, wait!"
262,Ross,Emily!
263,Ross,"No, wait, stop!"
264,Ross,"Emily, please Commercial Break"
265,Phoebe,Hey!
266,Rachel,Hi.
267,Phoebe,"So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?"
268,Rachel,Manhattan does not have enough stores.
269,Phoebe,"Well, I think I can help you get over him."
270,Rachel,You can?
271,Phoebe,Yeah.
272,Phoebe,I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
273,Rachel,Um-hmm.
274,Phoebe,And a small piece of chocolate.
275,Rachel,Okay.
276,Phoebe,And a glass of tepid water.
277,Rachel,"Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?"
278,Phoebe,"Uh, only if you have the hiccups too."
279,Phoebe,"Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me."
280,Phoebe,I just didn't feel like getting up.
281,Phoebe,"Okay, I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross."
282,Phoebe,Okay?
283,Phoebe,And you're going to remember all of the bad things about him.
284,Phoebe,All right?
285,Phoebe,Really focus on his flaws.
286,Rachel,I can do that.
287,Rachel,I certainly did it when we were going out.
288,Phoebe,Okay.
289,Phoebe,"Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he's such a great guy."
290,Phoebe,Here.
291,Phoebe,"Okay, now, close your eyes."
292,Phoebe,And imagine that you're with Ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him.
293,Phoebe,And you're-you're running your hands all over his body.
294,Phoebe,"And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it'suck!"
295,Phoebe,Hah?
296,Rachel,"I don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy."
297,Phoebe,"Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought."
298,Phoebe,"Umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy."
299,Rachel,Okay.
300,Phoebe,Okay?
301,Rachel,All right.
302,Phoebe,"So uh, now look at the picture"
303,Rachel,Okay.
304,Phoebe,"All right, and umm"
305,Rachel,Ow!
306,Phoebe,"Okay, how do you feel now?"
307,Rachel,"Well, I like you less!"
308,Joey,Hey.
309,Chandler,Hey.
310,Joey,Oh.
311,Joey,Sorry!
312,Chandler,"No-no-no, y'know what?"
313,Chandler,"I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool."
314,Chandler,"And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day."
315,Joey,Me too.
316,Chandler,Yeah?
317,Joey,Noo!!
318,Joey,I've had the best day ever!
319,Joey,"Dude, check this out!"
320,Monica,Hey!
321,Joey,Sh-shh-shh!
322,Joey,"Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat."
323,Joey,"Oh, Chandler."
324,Chandler,That's That's was
325,Monica,Oh my God!
326,Joey,That's Fergie baby!
327,Chandler,How did you?
328,Chandler,How?
329,Chandler,How?
330,Joey,"Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right?"
331,Joey,"So, I'm in my map and-and Hey!"
332,Monica,Hey!
333,Ross,Hi.
334,Ross,I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
335,Monica,"Yes, I did!"
336,Monica,And you are welcome!
337,Ross,Am I?!
338,Ross,And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?
339,Monica,Umm
340,Chandler,I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
341,Joey,Wait up!
342,Ross,"Hey-hey, since you're the fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?"
343,Monica,She said that?
344,Ross,Yeah.
345,Monica,Why?
346,Ross,"I don't know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out."
347,Monica,Oh my God.
348,Monica,You're even dumber than I am!
349,Ross,Excuse me?
350,Monica,"Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?"
351,Ross,I don't know.
352,Ross,A month?
353,Monica,Emily has probably been planning it since she was five!
354,Monica,Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head.
355,Monica,That's what we did!
356,Monica,"We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top."
357,Monica,Thanks.
358,Monica,But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
359,Ross,I had no idea.
360,Ross,"And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun."
361,Monica,Sometimes we were.
362,Ross,Come on.
363,Ross,You gotta help me figure out what to do.
364,Ross,Okay?
365,Monica,Okay.
366,Ross,Come on.
367,Chandler,That was pretty intense huh?
368,Joey,Yeah.
369,Joey,"Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!"
370,Chandler,I hope he did!
371,Phoebe,Hello.
372,Joey,"Hey, Pheebs!"
373,Joey,It's Joey!
374,Phoebe,"Hey, Joey!"
375,Phoebe,Hey!
376,Phoebe,Ooh!
377,Phoebe,Ooh!
378,Phoebe,I just say someone on thethat looks just like you on the subway.
379,Phoebe,And I was gonna go over and say hi!'
380,Phoebe,"but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you."
381,Joey,That just cost me four bucks.
382,Joey,"But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?"
383,Phoebe,"Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe!"
384,Phoebe,Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all.
385,Phoebe,"So, do you miss me?"
386,Joey,"Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun."
387,Phoebe,So you're not homesick yet?
388,Joey,"No, I don't think so."
389,Phoebe,"All right, the seven of us miss you."
390,Joey,Who's seven?
391,Phoebe,"Y'know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies"
392,Joey,"Ahh, the babies miss me?"
393,Phoebe,"Ooh, the pizza guy's here!"
394,Joey,What?
395,Joey,You ordered pizza without me?
396,Phoebe,Yeah.
397,Phoebe,"But y'know we were thinking about you, y'know we ordered the Joey Special."
398,Joey,Two pizzas?
399,Phoebe,Yep!
400,Phoebe,"Okay, gotta go, talk to you later."

425,Rachel,"Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does."
426,Rachel,But I have to tell him how I feel!
427,Rachel,He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
428,Phoebe,That's not why you're going!
429,Phoebe,"You're going because you hope he's gonna say, ""Yeah, I love you too, Rach."
430,Phoebe,"Forget that British chippy."""

50,Joey,So did that do anything for ya?
51,Joey,Opening Credits
52,Ross,Y'know what?
53,Ross,I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!
54,Rachel,But your divorce isn't even final yet.
55,Ross,Just the one divorce in '99!
56,Ross,"Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year."
57,Ross,I am gonna make myself happy.
58,Chandler,"Do you want us to leave the room, or?"
59,Ross,Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before.
60,Ross,That my friends is my New Year's resolution.
61,Phoebe,Ooh!
62,Phoebe,That's a good one!
63,Phoebe,Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
64,Chandler,"That's good one too, Pheebs."
65,Chandler,Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
66,Phoebe,"Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane."
67,Monica,She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
68,Ross,"In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us."
69,Ross,"Eh, y'know what, better yet?"
70,Ross,A week.
71,Chandler,I'll take that bet my friend.
72,Chandler,"And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the ""new thing you do that day!"""
73,Chandler,And it starts right now!
74,Joey,"All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar."
75,Ross,Ohh.
76,Phoebe,Really?!
77,Phoebe,How come?
78,Joey,"Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume?"
79,Joey,I would love it would be great if one of those was true.
80,Phoebe,Do you want me to teach you?
81,Phoebe,I'm a great teacher.
82,Joey,Really?
83,Joey,Who-who have you taught?
84,Phoebe,"Well, I taught me and I love me."
85,Joey,Yeah that'd be great!
86,Joey,Thanks Pheebs!
87,Rachel,"Op, look!"
88,Rachel,Claire forgot her glasses!
89,Rachel,"And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about."
90,Monica,"Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less."
91,Rachel,I don't gossip!
92,Rachel,"Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip."
93,Rachel,"I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?"
94,Monica,"Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would."
95,Rachel,What?
96,Rachel,They were like this!

114,Chandler,"No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before."
115,Joey,Oh really!
116,Joey,Where?
117,Joey,Somewhere funny I'd bet!
118,Ross,"Hi, Pheebs!"
119,Phoebe,Hey!
120,Ross,"Oh-oh, guess what?"
121,Ross,I-I have a date with Elizabeth  Hornswoggle.

129,Phoebe,"First you learn here,  then you learn here."
130,Joey,"Umm, okay."
131,Phoebe,"Okay, lesson"
132,Chandler,What an interesting approach to guitar instruction.
133,Chandler,"Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular."
134,Phoebe,"Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today."
135,Phoebe,She didn't gossip at all.
136,Rachel,I didn't!
137,Rachel,"Even when I found outumm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it."
138,Joey,"Hey, Pheebs!"
139,Joey,Check-check this out.
140,Phoebe,"Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!"
141,Joey,"Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and"
142,Phoebe,"Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there?"
143,Phoebe,Did you?
144,Joey,No.
145,Phoebe,Give me your hands.
146,Phoebe,Strings.
147,Phoebe,Gimme it!
148,Phoebe,Pick.
149,Phoebe,Do you want to learn to play guitar?
150,Joey,Yes!
151,Phoebe,Then don't touch one!
152,Ross,Hi!
153,Monica,Hi Ben!
154,Chandler,Ross is wearing leather pants!
155,Chandler,Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants?
156,Chandler,Someone comment on the pants!
157,Rachel,I think they're very nice.
158,Monica,I like 'em.
159,Joey,Yeah!
160,Monica,I like them a lot.
161,Chandler,That's not what I had in mind!
162,Chandler,"See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants."
163,Chandler,"You see, they're very tight."
164,Chandler,Maybe there's something in that area.
165,Ross,"Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, ""Wow,  I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."""
166,Chandler,Oh come on!
167,Ross,"Okay, seriously, what do you think?"
168,Joey,You look like a freak.
169,Rachel,"Awful, absolutely awful."
170,Ross,"What are you, what are you doing?"
171,Monica,It's my New Year's resolution!
172,Ross,"What, to blind my child?"
173,Monica,No!
174,Monica,To take more pictures of all of us together.
175,Monica,I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
176,Joey,"Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well."
177,Ross,My God!
178,Ross,These pants are burning up!
179,Ross,"Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now!"
180,Ross,What is she trying to kill me?
181,Ross,It's like a volcano in here!
182,Ross,Are you hot?
183,Ross,Elizabeth
184,Ross,"Okay, it must just be me then."
185,Ross,That was just the pants on the couch.
186,Ross,"Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?"
187,Ross,Thanks.

201,Phoebe,Have you?
202,Phoebe,Oh my God!
203,Joey,What?!
204,Joey,I didn't touch a guitar!
205,Phoebe,"No, but you're questioning my method!"
206,Joey,"No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid!"
207,Joey,What?
208,Monica,Thank you.
209,Phoebe,Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
210,Joey,"Your other student, was you!"
211,Phoebe,"Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!"
212,Joey,"Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher!"
213,Joey,Right here!
214,Joey,Here!
215,Joey,"Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!"
216,Phoebe,Fine!
217,Phoebe,You go learn from your qualified instructor!
218,Phoebe,"But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!"
219,Rachel,"""Baddest man in the whole damn town."""
220,Phoebe,"Oh, fine!"
221,Phoebe,Take his side!
222,Monica,I can't wait to be with you!
223,Monica,I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben.
224,Monica,I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.

236,Joey,Okay.
237,Ross,"Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom"
238,Joey,Nice!
239,Ross,"No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat."
240,Ross,"Look, I-I can't put them back on."
241,Ross,I can't!
242,Joey,Oh.
243,Joey,That is quite a situation.
244,Joey,"Uh, do you see any like, powder?"
245,Ross,Powder!
246,Ross,Yeah!
247,Ross,"Yeah, I have powder!"
248,Joey,"Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up."
249,Ross,"Yeah, okay, hold on!"
250,Ross,They're not coming on man.
251,Joey,"Umm, do you see anyoh, Vaseline?"
252,Ross,"Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion!"
253,Ross,Will that work?
254,Joey,"Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there."
255,Ross,Hold on.
256,Joey,Ross?
257,Joey,You okay?
258,Ross,"They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!"
259,Joey,Really?!
260,Joey,"Uhh, what color is it?"
261,Ross,What difference does that make?
262,Joey,"Well, I'm justif the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!"
263,Rachel,"Joey, do you have a minute?"
264,Ross,"Dude, what am I gonna"
265,Joey,"Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out."
266,Rachel,"Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!"
267,Joey,"Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better."
268,Joey,I am putting out fires all over the place.
269,Rachel,Okay.
270,Rachel,Okay.
271,Rachel,Okay.
272,Rachel,"Joey, I have got to tell you something!"
273,Joey,"What-what is it, what is it?"
274,Rachel,"Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone."
275,Joey,"Oh no, no-no-no-no!"
276,Joey,I don't want to know!
277,Rachel,Yes!
278,Rachel,Yes!
279,Rachel,"Yes, you do want to know!"
280,Rachel,This is unbelievable!
281,Joey,"I don't care, Rach!"
282,Joey,"Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!"
283,Rachel,What?
284,Rachel,What secrets?
285,Rachel,You know secrets?
286,Rachel,What are they?
287,Joey,And you're not supposed to be gossiping!
288,Rachel,"I know, I know!"
289,Rachel,"I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone"
290,Joey,I'm not listening to you!
291,Ross,"All right, I'm coming out."
292,Ross,"Hey, can you turn the lights off."
293,Ross,I had a problem.
294,Joey,"Hey, Pheebs?"
295,Phoebe,"No, I can't talk to you!"
296,Phoebe,I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
297,Joey,"Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again."
298,Joey,"And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready."
299,Joey,You really think I'm ready?
300,Phoebe,Uh-huh!
301,Joey,Wow!
302,Joey,Cool!
303,Joey,Was the chord at least right
304,Phoebe,No!
305,Chandler,Oh my God!
306,Monica,"We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry."
307,Ross,This year was supposed to be great!
308,Ross,"But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!"
309,Ross,Look at me!
310,Monica,"Hey, hey, look."
311,Monica,"Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you!"
312,Monica,Huh?
313,Monica,You're-you're a cowboy!
314,Ross,"Oh, be-because of the leather pants."
315,Monica,See?
316,Monica,"Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy!"
317,Monica,Now that's something.
318,Phoebe,Yeah!
319,Rachel,That really is something; that's really cool.
320,Joey,Howdy partner!
321,Ross,Maybe I should get another pair!
322,Ross,"Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides."
323,Ross,I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight.
324,Ross,I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.
325,Ross,I would make a good cowboy.
326,Monica,"Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry."

333,Rachel,"Good luck, honey!"
334,Phoebe,Bye!
335,Rachel,"Hey, uh, Joey?"
336,Joey,Umm?
337,Rachel,Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
338,Joey,"Oh, no!"
339,Rachel,"I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it."
340,Rachel,Right?
341,Joey,"Well, then it wouldn't be a secret."
342,Joey,"So yeah, that would be okay."
343,Joey,Yeah.
344,Joey,Yeah!
345,Rachel,Yeah.
346,Rachel,Well.

358,Rachel,Well then I can't tell you what I know.
359,Joey,"Okay, fine."

187,Phoebe,I just want you to know what a wonderful    man your son is.
188,Phoebe,"Well, and you know, it really is a testament to how    he was raised."
189,Phoebe,Especially to you.
190,Phoebe,Because he's very respectful of women.
191,Phoebe,Are you kidding.
192,Phoebe,He is so considerate of my feelings    and... you know I think... you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle    lover.
193,Phoebe,"Oh no,    no, no, no, no, no."
194,Phoebe,Don't get me wrong.
195,Phoebe,"No, he's not in like a sissy way."
196,Phoebe,"No,    no, no... when he gets going, he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave..."
197,Chandler,I'm not gonna watch it...
198,Chandler,I don't NEED to watch    it...
199,Chandler,"I mean, what good could possibly come from watching?"
200,Chandler,"Well, we    know I'm gonna watch it."
201,Joey,"Hey dude, what's up?"
202,Chandler,"Don't judge me, I'm only human!"
203,Joey,Did you take that tape?
204,Chandler,I had to!
205,Chandler,"Okay, imagine you were married... and    you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need    to know what was on it?"
206,Joey,I don't know.
207,Joey,Who'm I'm married to?
208,Chandler,Some girl...!
209,Joey,She hot?
210,Chandler,Yeah...!
211,Joey,How did she get me to settle down?
212,Chandler,"Allright, I'm gonna watch it..."
213,Chandler,"I mean look, it's    probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is..."
214,Chandler,It can't possibly    be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head...  Can it?
215,Joey,Guess I don't know.
216,Joey,My
217,Chandler,Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.
218,Joey,What?
219,Joey,Whoo... What?
220,Chandler,"Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is..."
221,Chandler,Please?
222,Joey,"All right, fine..."
223,Joey,"But if I enjoy this, you have only    yourself to blame..."
224,Chandler,Why am I hearing cheering?
225,Joey,"Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game."
226,Chandler,Football?
227,Chandler,Just football?
228,Joey,"Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing."
229,Chandler,It's football...
230,Chandler,It's just football...
231,Chandler,This is great!
232,Chandler,This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football...
233,Chandler,It may be customary to    get a beer...     What the...     What are you doing?
234,Joey,You don't wanna see what I just saw!
235,Monica,What are you guys doing?
236,Monica,"Oh my God, is that Richard?"
237,Rachel,Okay... aahhh...
238,Rachel,Please laugh for mommy...
239,Rachel,Please?
240,Rachel,Please laugh for mommy...  Not funny huh?
241,Rachel,"Oh so, is it... only offensive novelty    rap?"
242,Rachel,"Or maybe just, you know, rap in general?"
243,Rachel,"'Cause mommy can rap...  My    name is mommy and I'm here to say / that all the babies are... Oh, I can't    rap... Allright sweetheart..."
244,Rachel,"This is only because I love you so much, and I    know that you're not gonna tell anybody..."
245,Rachel,I    like... big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... / when    a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face...
246,Rachel,Yes!
247,Rachel,Yes!
248,Rachel,Yes!
249,Rachel,YES!
250,Rachel,Oohhhhh!
251,Rachel,Oh!
252,Rachel,I like big butts and    I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... Oh Emma you're laughing!
253,Rachel,"Oh you are, you really do like big butts, don't you."
254,Rachel,Oh you beautiful little    weirdo...
255,Ross,Hey!
256,Rachel,Oh you missed it.
257,Rachel,She was laughing.
258,Rachel,Oh it was amazing.
259,Rachel,It was amazing.
260,Rachel,"It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that..."
261,Ross,"Oh I know, isn't it?"
262,Ross,Ooh... what'd you do to get her    to laugh?
263,Rachel,Oh!
264,Rachel,"You know, I just... couple of things I tried ..."
265,Rachel,I just sang a little doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider...
266,Ross,You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?
267,Rachel,Nothing else worked.
268,Rachel,That girl is all about the ass...
269,Phoebe,"...and then it goes back to the chorus... Smelly    cat, Sme-lly ca-t / I-t's not your fau-lt. And that's the end of the song..."
270,Phoebe,"I realise that you didn't ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen    minutes."
271,Phoebe,"Oh, Pervert Parade?"
272,Phoebe,"Oh, Ode To A Pubic Hair?"
273,Phoebe,Oh God!
274,Phoebe,Is that veal?
275,Phoebe,"Oh no, no, no, no... That's okay, that's okay..."
276,Phoebe,"I    mean, I'm..."
277,Phoebe,"I am a vegetarian... except for veal... Yeah no, veal I love..."
278,Phoebe,"No, no, no, I actually it's any baby"
279,Monica,So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?
280,Chandler,Whoho ho...
281,Chandler,Listen to the judgement from the porn    star!
282,Monica,That tape was never meant to be seen by...     Joey I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private.
283,Joey,"Monica, look..."
284,Joey,"I don't think you and I have    any secrets anymore...  Not ready to joke about    it yet, okay, I see you later."
285,Monica,Why in the world would you take this tape and and    why would you watch it?
286,Chandler,"Because that's who I am, okay?"
287,Chandler,I'm sure a mature    man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him.
288,Chandler,Just'd    be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and    moustaches.
289,Monica,Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?
290,Chandler,This is about you and Richard.
291,Chandler,He's clearly not    over you.
292,Chandler,He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
293,Monica,Isn't that sad?
294,Monica,"I mean, can you see how pathetic that    is?"
295,Monica,You shouldn't be jealous.
296,Monica,You should feel bad for him.
297,Chandler,"Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard."
298,Chandler,Y'...
299,Chandler,I can grow a    moustache!
300,Monica,"Chandler, this is not our problem."
301,Monica,We've got each    other.
302,Monica,That's all that matters.
303,Chandler,"Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling    around with him with your cowboy boots in the air..."
304,Monica,Cowboy boots?
305,Monica,I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole    life!
306,Chandler,"Oh, good, good."
307,Chandler,"Play more, 'cause I wanna see how    it ends."
308,Monica,THAT'S NOT ME!
309,Chandler,What...?
310,Chandler,That's not you!
311,Chandler,Life is good again!
312,Chandler,Ride    'em cowgirl!
313,Monica,That bastard taped over me!
314,Chandler,Is that a problem?
315,Monica,I-It's just so insulting!
316,Monica,"Big spring for a new blank    tape, Doctor!"
317,Phoebe,Yeah...
318,Phoebe,The woman you what?
319,Phoebe,I love you too...
320,Phoebe,YEAH...!
321,Phoebe,How great is this...?
322,Phoebe,Okay.
323,Phoebe,I had a great time.
324,Phoebe,It was really top drawer.
325,Phoebe,And here's something
326,Ross,"She sweat, wet."
327,Ross,got it going like a turbo 'vette.
328,Rachel,So fellas
329,Ross,Yeah!
330,Rachel,fellas
331,Ross,Yeah!
332,Rachel,has your girlfriend got the butt?
333,Ross,Hell yeah!
334,Rachel,So shake it!
335,Ross,Shake it!
336,Rachel,Shake it!
337,Ross,Shake it!
338,Rachel,Shake that nasty butt...
339,Ross,Baby got back
340,Rachel,One more time from the top...
341,Rachel,"I like big butts    and I cannot lie, you other br..."
342,Ross,Rachel please!
343,Ross,That is so inappropriate!
344,Ross,END
0,Chandler,This is unbelievable.
1,Chandler,It's been like a half an hour.
2,Chandler,"If this was a cartoon, you'd be looking like a ham right about now."
3,Joey,There's the waitress.
4,Joey,"Excuse me, Miss."
5,Joey,"Hello, Miss?"
6,Chandler,It's Phoebe!
7,Chandler,Hi!
8,Chandler,"Wait, wait!"
9,Chandler,Wh-what are you doing here?
10,Joey,"No, no... how come you are working here?"
11,Chandler,Can we start over?
12,Joey,"No, no, no!"
13,Joey,Opening Credits
14,Ross,"I don't know whether he's testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control."
15,Ross,"But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, ""supposedly"" by accident."
16,Rachel,"No, yeah, I've done that."
17,Ross,"And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword."
18,Rachel,I've never done that.
19,Chandler,"All right, now look at her and tell me she doesn't look exactly like her sister."
20,Joey,I'm sayin' I see a difference.
21,Chandler,They're twins!
22,Joey,I don't care.
23,Joey,Phoebe's Phoebe.
24,Joey,Ursula's... hot!
25,Chandler,"You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?"
26,Joey,Yeah.
27,Chandler,Let's not do that any more.
28,Joey,"Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today."
29,Phoebe,"Ooh, ooh, fun!"
30,Phoebe,"Okay... um, Liam Neeson."
31,Joey,Nope.
32,Phoebe,Morly Safer.
33,Joey,Nope.
34,Phoebe,The woman who cuts my hair!
35,Monica,"Okay, look, this could be a really long game."
36,Chandler,Your sister Ursula.
37,Phoebe,"Oh, really."
38,Chandler,"Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh..."
39,Phoebe,Rift's.
40,Phoebe,"Yeah, I know."
41,Chandler,"Oh, you do?"
42,Chandler,Because she said you guys haven't talked in like years.
43,Phoebe,Hmmm?
44,Phoebe,Yeah.
45,Phoebe,"So, um, is she fat?"
46,Joey,Not from where I was standin'.
47,Phoebe,where were you standing?
48,Rachel,"Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just don't get along?"
49,Phoebe,"It's mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day."
50,Phoebe,"But, to my parents, by then it was like ""yeah, right, well what else is new?"""
51,Ross,"Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, I've got to go."
52,Ross,I've got Lamaze class.
53,Chandler,"Oh, and I've got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym."
54,Rachel,"So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?"
55,Ross,"No, Susan's gonna be there too."
56,Ross,"We've got dads, we've got lesbians, the whole parenting team."
57,Rachel,"Well, isn't, isn't that gonna be weird?"
58,Ross,"No, no."
59,Ross,"I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation."
60,Monica,"Ross, that's my jacket."
61,Ross,I know.
62,Ross,"Hi, um, I'm err,  I'm Ross Geller, and err ah...  ..that's, that's my boy in there, and uh,  this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch."
63,Ross,"Susan is um Carol's, just, com...  ..who's next?"
64,Ross,"Susan is Carol's, Carol's, Carol's, friend..."
65,Ross,Like buddies.
66,Ross,You know how close women can get.
67,Ross,Although I was married to her.
68,Ross,"Err, right."
69,Ross,A little.
70,Ross,Absolutely.
71,Ross,"So, twins... hah!"
72,Ross,That's like two births.
73,Ross,Ouch.
74,Chandler,"And  to you too, Helen."
75,Chandler,"Oh, okay."
76,Chandler,Send her in.
77,Chandler,"Hi, Nina."
78,Chandler,Come on in.
79,Chandler,"Uh, Yes."
80,Chandler,Yes.
81,Chandler,"I've just been going over your data here, and little thing, you've been post-dating your Friday numbers."
82,Chandler,"Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack."
83,Chandler,WENUS.
84,Chandler,Weekly Estimated Net...
85,Chandler,"It's not just that she's cute, okay."
86,Chandler,It's just that... she's really really cute.
87,Ross,It doesn't matter.
88,Ross,You don't dip your pen in the company ink.
89,Monica,"Ross, your little creature's got the remote again."
90,Ross,"Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote."
91,Ross,Marcel.
92,Ross,"Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote..."
93,Monica,Great.
94,Ross,"Relax, I'll fix it."
95,Rachel,"Cool... ""Urkel"" in Spanish is ""Urkel."""
96,Ross,How did he do this?
97,Chandler,"So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?"
98,Monica,"Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Year's... but obviously someone forgot."
99,Rachel,"Well, someone was supposed to write ""Rach, take down the lights"" and put it on the re... frigerate...  How long has that been there?"
100,Chandler,"Hey, where you been?"
101,Joey,I went back to Riff's.
102,Joey,I think Ursula likes me.
103,Joey,"All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries."
104,Chandler,Score.
105,Joey,She is so hot!
106,Chandler,"Yeah, listen."
107,Chandler,"Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err..."
108,Joey,Pheebs?
109,Phoebe,Yeah?
110,Joey,You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?
111,Phoebe,Why?
112,Phoebe,Why would you wanna... do that?
113,Phoebe,Why?
114,Joey,"So that if we went out on a date, she'd be there."
115,Phoebe,"Well, I mean, I'm not my sister's, you know, whatever, and um..."
116,Phoebe,"I mean, it's true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, we've grown apart, so, um..."
117,Phoebe,"I don't know, why not?"
118,Phoebe,Okay.
119,Joey,"Cool, thanks."
120,Ross,You okay?
121,Phoebe,Yeah I'm fine.
122,Ross,You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
123,Ross,Sorry.
124,Ross,Hi.
125,Ross,Sorry I'm late.
126,Ross,"Where's, where's Carol?"
127,Ross,No... No... No.
128,Ross,"I think I should stay, I think we should both know what's going on."
129,Ross,"Okay, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time."
130,Ross,I see.
131,Ross,So what do you propose to do?
132,Ross,Flip me for it?
133,Ross,"No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!"
134,Chandler,"Mr. D, how's it going, sir?"
135,Chandler,Mr.
136,Chandler,And?
137,Chandler,Mr.
138,Chandler,So what does this mean?
139,Chandler,Mr.
140,Chandler,"Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;  Mr."
141,Chandler,Nina?
142,Chandler,Nina.
143,Chandler,Nina.
144,Chandler,Nina.
145,Chandler,"Yes, yes I am."
146,Chandler,"Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please don't hate me."
147,Chandler,Would you like to have dinner sometime?
148,Rachel,"So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?"
149,Phoebe,"Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me."
150,Rachel,Okay... Let me put it this way.
151,Rachel,Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?
152,Phoebe,Ooh!
153,Phoebe,Bath salts would be nice.
154,Rachel,"Ooh, okay... good."
155,Phoebe,Yeah?
156,Phoebe,"Right, and it's me."
157,Phoebe,Much as you are.
158,Phoebe,"Oh, that's good."
159,Phoebe,Good choice.
160,Monica,I can't believe you.
161,Monica,You still haven't told that girl she doesn't have a job yet?
162,Chandler,"Well, you still haven't taken down the Christmas lights."
163,Monica,"Congratulations, I think you've found the world's thinnest argument."
164,Chandler,"I'm just trying to find the right moment, you know?"
165,Rachel,"Oh, well, that shouldn't be so hard, now that you're dating."
166,Rachel,"""Sweetheart, you're fired, but how 'bout a quickie before I go to work?"""
167,Joey,Hey.
168,Joey,Rachel and
169,Chandler,Hey.
170,Chandler,"You know, once you're inside, you don't have to knock any more."
171,Monica,I'll get it.
172,Monica,Oh.
173,Monica,"Hi, Mr.Heckles."
174,Monica,Mr.Heckles
175,Monica,We're not doing anything.
176,Monica,"We're just sitting around talking, quietly."
177,Monica,Mr.Heckles
178,Rachel,You don't even have cats.
179,Rachel,Mr.Heckles
180,Monica,Goodbye Mr.Heckles.
181,Rachel,We'll try to keep it down.
182,Joey,"Phoebe, could you do me a favour?"
183,Joey,Could you try this on?
184,Joey,I just wanna make sure it fits.
185,Phoebe,"Ooh, my first birthday present...  ..oh, this is really..."
186,Joey,"Oh, no no no."
187,Joey,It's for Ursula.
188,Joey,"I just figured, you know, size-wise."
189,Phoebe,"Ohhh... Sure, yeah...  ..okay, it fits."
190,Rachel,Are you seein' her again tonight?
191,Joey,Yep.
192,Joey,Ice Capades.
193,Chandler,"Wow, this is serious."
194,Chandler,I've never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
195,Joey,I don't know.
196,Joey,"I like her, you know."
197,Joey,She's different.
198,Joey,"There's uh, somethin' about her."
199,Phoebe,"That you like,  we get it."
200,Phoebe,You like her.
201,Phoebe,Great!
202,Joey,"Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay."
203,Phoebe,"Alright, well, maybe now it's not okay."
204,Joey,Okay... Well maybe now I'm not okay with it not being okay.
205,Phoebe,Okay.
206,Chandler,"Knit, good woman, knit, knit!"
207,Chandler,And that's the Chrysler Building right there.
208,Chandler,Mr.
209,Chandler,"Yes, yes she is."
210,Chandler,Didn't I memo you on this?
211,Chandler,"See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan."
212,Chandler,"And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy."
213,Chandler,Mr.
214,Chandler,"Oh, no, no."
215,Chandler,Nina...  ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo!
216,Chandler,"In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all."
217,Chandler,Mr.
218,Chandler,"And yet, believable."
219,Chandler,"So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others."
220,Chandler,Mr.
221,Chandler,"Well, I guess that's why they call it psychology, sir."
222,Ross,"Susan, go deep."
223,Ross,"Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everything's gonna be alright."
224,Ross,I'm gonna be a father.
225,Rachel,This is just occurring to you?
226,Ross,"I always knew I was havin' a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me."
227,Rachel,"Oh, you're gonna be great!"
228,Ross,"Aw, how can you say that?"
229,Ross,I can't even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat.
230,Ross,How am I gonna raise a kid?
231,Chandler,"You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different."
232,Phoebe,Where're you going?
233,Joey,Out.
234,Phoebe,With?
235,Joey,Yes.
236,Phoebe,"Alright, could I just ask you one question?"
237,Phoebe,"Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?"
238,Joey,"Well, not that it's any of your business, but, no, we haven't, okay?"
239,Joey,"You meant sex, right?"
240,Chandler,"Ah, sure, Nina."
241,Chandler,What's up?
242,Chandler,"Oh, well, ah... maybe that's because they're ah... jealous, of us."
243,Chandler,"Ah, well, maybe that's, ah, because you're getting a big raise."
244,Chandler,"Sure, why not?"
245,Chandler,"Oh, you don't know."
246,Chandler,"Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder's raise?"
247,Chandler,Helen drinks.
248,Chandler,Will you marry me?
249,Chandler,"Well, I ended up telling her everything."
250,Rachel,"Oh, how'd she take it?"
251,Chandler,Pretty well.
252,Chandler,Except for the stapler thing.
253,Chandler,Little
254,Monica,"Okay, I think I get how to do this."
255,Phoebe,"Alright, so, can we turn this off?"
256,Phoebe,Can we just make it... make them go away?
257,Phoebe,"Because I can't, I can't watch."
258,Monica,"okay, Pheebs, they're gone."
259,Phoebe,Okay.
260,Monica,Are you alright?
261,Phoebe,Yeah.
262,Phoebe,"It's just, you know, it's this whole stupid Ursula thing, it's..."
263,Rachel,"Okay, Pheebs, can I ask?"
264,Rachel,"So, he's going out with her."
265,Rachel,"I mean, is it really so terrible?"
266,Phoebe,"Um, yeah."
267,Phoebe,"Look, I mean, I'm not saying she's like evil or anything."
268,Phoebe,"She just, you know, she's always breaking my stuff."
269,Phoebe,"When I was eight, and I wouldn't let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus."
270,Phoebe,"And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?"
271,Phoebe,Monica and
272,Rachel,No.
273,Phoebe,"Well, but that's what he was for me."
274,Phoebe,"And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldn't even talk to me any more."
275,Phoebe,Because he said he didn't wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us.
276,Rachel,"Oh... Oh, Pheebs."
277,Phoebe,"I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but..."
278,Chandler,You're not gonna lose him.
279,Monica,"Hon, you gotta talk to Joey."
280,Phoebe,Yeah.
281,Phoebe,Okay.
282,Ross,"No, come on, he doesn't know this stuff."
283,Ross,If he knew how you felt.
284,Phoebe,But he's falling in love with her.
285,Rachel,"Oh please, they've been going out a week."
286,Rachel,"They haven't even slept together yet, I mean, that's not serious."
287,Phoebe,Okay...
288,Phoebe,Okay.
289,Phoebe,"Oh, okay, oh."
290,Monica,"Rachel, what are you doing?"
291,Monica,It's freezing out here.
292,Monica,Would you come back inside?
293,Rachel,No no no no no.
294,Rachel,"You wanted me to take them down, so..."
295,Rachel,..I'm takin' 'em down.
296,Rachel,Okay?
297,Rachel,Whoa!
298,Monica,Oh-my-god Rachel!
299,Monica,Rachel!
300,Rachel,I'm okay!
301,Rachel,I'm okay!
302,Rachel,"Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?"
303,Rachel,Mr.Heckles
0,Phoebe,Oh!
1,Phoebe,"Hey, Rach!"
2,Rachel,Hi!
3,Rachel,"Hey, Happy Valentine's Day!"
4,Phoebe,"Oh, you, too."
5,Joey,"Hey, so, uh, how's it going living over at Ross'?"
6,Rachel,It's good.
7,Rachel,Except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long.
8,Rachel,Did you know that something really boring happened to someone really ugly in the Middle Ages?
9,Rachel,"Oh, thank you."
10,Rachel,I'll see you guys later.
11,Phoebe,Okay.
12,Joey,Bye.
13,Joey,There's one lucky to-go cup of coffee.
14,Phoebe,"Honey, I wish you would get over her."
15,Phoebe,I hate seeing you like this.
16,Phoebe,Is there anything I can do for you?
17,Phoebe,Do you want to look down my top?
18,Joey,Thanks.
19,Joey,But maybe later.
20,Phoebe,"Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?"
21,Joey,You know what I want?
22,Joey,I want a lot of things!
23,Joey,I want to be with the woman I love on Valentine's Day!
24,Joey,And I want her to love me back!
25,Joey,And I want just one moment of relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that that's never going to happen!
26,Joey,"Oh, okay."
27,Joey,Opening Credits
28,Phoebe,"So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?"
29,Ross,"Oh, I'm actually on my way to tell her right now."
30,Ross,"Yeah, she's been away all week visiting her parents, but she'll be cool."
31,Ross,"I mean, she's been so supportive."
32,Ross,"She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, Fossils are my friends.'"
33,Phoebe,Ugh.
34,Phoebe,"Come on, Mona, don't kiss ass."
35,Ross,"Uh, I'm going to take off."
36,Phoebe,All right.
37,Phoebe,Oh!
38,Phoebe,Shoot!
39,Phoebe,Oh shoot!
40,Phoebe,"Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape!"
41,Ross,What is it?
42,Phoebe,It's a video of my friend giving birth.
43,Phoebe,Could you just bring it back to your apartment?
44,Ross,All right.
45,Ross,Candy and Cookie?'
46,Phoebe,Yeah.
47,Phoebe,"Candy's the mother, Cookie's the daughter."
48,Phoebe,The father's also Cookie.
49,Phoebe,Why am I friends with these people?
50,Monica,"Phoebe, c'mere."
51,Monica,I want to show you something in the bathroom.
52,Phoebe,"Oh, Monica, grow up!"
53,Ross,"Hey, what's behind your back?"
54,Monica,Nothing.
55,Monica,Just something I want to get Phoebe's opinion on for Valentine's Day.
56,Ross,You don't want my opinion?
57,Monica,Not really.
58,Ross,"Come on, I'm your older brother, ask me!"
59,Monica,"All right, big brother."
60,Monica,"Which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so your best friend would want to do her?"
61,Ross,The red one.
62,Phoebe,Hey.
63,Phoebe,"Look, I know you've been really depressed lately, so I brought someone over to cheer you up."
64,Phoebe,"Right outside this door is a real, live, furry playmate."
65,Joey,"No, I'm not sleeping with your friend Jane again."
66,Phoebe,He-hee!
67,Joey,Hey!
68,Joey,A dog!
69,Joey,Hi!
70,Joey,"Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane."
71,Phoebe,This is the happiest dog in the world.
72,Phoebe,I borrowed him from my friend Wendy.
73,Phoebe,"Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up."
74,Phoebe,And he will cheer you up!
75,Joey,"Thanks so much, Pheebs!"
76,Joey,"We are going to have so much fun, yes we are!"
77,Joey,Oh!
78,Joey,Not that kind of fun.
79,Chandler,Happy Valentine's!
80,Monica,Okay!
81,Monica,I'll be right out.
82,Monica,"I'm slipping into something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty."
83,Chandler,Candy and Cookie'.
84,Chandler,Candy and Cookie?'
85,Chandler,Monica got me porn?!
86,Chandler,Girl-on-girl porn?!
87,Chandler,She really must love me!!
88,Chandler,Man on
89,Chandler,"I love you, St. Valentine."
90,Chandler,"Woah, woah, that's not pretty!"
91,Chandler,Man on
92,Chandler,Worst porn ever!
93,Chandler,Worst porn ever!
94,Chandler,Woman on
95,Chandler,I am trying!
96,Joey,"Get the ball, ready?"
97,Joey,"Get the ball, get the ball!"
98,Joey,"Well, you're cute, but you're not too smart!"
99,Joey,Did I just throw this?
100,Rachel,Hi.
101,Joey,Hi.
102,Rachel,I accidentally packed these with my stuff.
103,Rachel,Who is this?
104,Joey,"Oh, that's, uh, that's Phoebe's friend's dog."
105,Joey,"I don't know what his real name is, but I call him Mozzarella."
106,Rachel,"Oh, well, you are so cute!"
107,Rachel,"I wish I could play with you more, but I've got to go to work!"
108,Rachel,"I hope I stop talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes I do."
109,Rachel,Yes I do.
110,Rachel,"Bye-bye, Joey."
111,Rachel,"Oh, I seriously can't stop it."
112,Joey,C'mere.
113,Joey,Hey.
114,Joey,C'mere.
115,Joey,That's Rachel.
116,Joey,She's the one who used to live here.
117,Joey,Might as well be honest with youwe love her.
118,Joey,But we can't have her.
119,Joey,I really miss her.
120,Joey,"Well, hey, you understand, right?"
121,Joey,You're a guy.
122,Joey,"Well, you used to be."
123,Monica,So what do you think?
124,Monica,I've still got it!
125,Chandler,Why did you get me this?
126,Monica,What is it?
127,Chandler,It's yellingbleedingdilating.
128,Chandler,"Oh, the dilating"
129,Monica,Is this the video of the baby being born?
130,Monica,"Sweetie, this is Phoebe's."
131,Monica,Why were you even watching it?
132,Chandler,I thoughtmaybeyou got me porn for Valentine's Day.
133,Monica,"Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentine's Day  you were right!"
134,Monica,"Apparently, it's about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having sex with a lot of guys!"
135,Monica,"Yeah, it got four starts!"
136,Monica,"Oh, wait a minute."
137,Monica,Those aren't stars.
138,Monica,"Anyway, you want to take a look?"
139,Chandler,"Well, I'm not really in a sexy mood right now."
140,Monica,"Honey, what's going on?"
141,Chandler,"Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?"
142,Monica,Mm-hmm.
143,Chandler,How long it took to go back in the water?
144,Monica,"Chandler, we can't let this tape wreck Valentine's Day!"
145,Chandler,You don't know.
146,Chandler,You didn't see it.
147,Monica,"Child-birth, it's a natural thing!"
148,Monica,It's beautiful.
149,Chandler,"Oh, beautiful?"
150,Chandler,Really?
151,Chandler,Beautiful?
152,Chandler,You think this is beautiful?
153,Monica,Oh!
154,Monica,"Oh, my God!"
155,Monica,No wonder my mother hates me!
156,Chandler,"See, honey, there's"
157,Monica,Don't touch me!
158,Ross,Hey!
159,Ross,"So, how was Atlantic City?"
160,Ross,Yeah?
161,Ross,Wha?
162,Ross,"Oh, come on."
163,Ross,You didn't have tosaltwater taffy?!
164,Ross,Thanks!
165,Ross,This is interesting.
166,Ross,"You know, most people think this is made with sea water, but it's actually made with, uh, salted fresh water."
167,Ross,That's not interesting.
168,Ross,I do too!
169,Ross,I missed you!
170,Ross,"Oh, it was good!"
171,Ross,It was good.
172,Ross,"Actually, the baby started kicking!"
173,Ross,Yeah!
174,Ross,I know!
175,Ross,It was.
176,Ross,Oh the only sad thing is I wasn't around when it happened for the first time.
177,Ross,"Yeah, I'm missing out on all this other stuff, too."
178,Ross,"So, Joey suggested Rachel move in with me."
179,Ross,What?
180,Ross,Huhuh-huh.
181,Ross,Just a second!
182,Ross,Commercial Break
183,Phoebe,How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?
184,Ross,"I don't know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea!"
185,Ross,"Um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy!"
186,Phoebe,"Taffy, really?"
187,Phoebe,I've never had any.
188,Ross,Ever?
189,Phoebe,"Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats."
190,Phoebe,Thank you!
191,Phoebe,"So what, you're just never going to tell her?"
192,Ross,"Oh, no, no, no, I will!"
193,Ross,"I just want to butter her up, first!"
194,Ross,"You know, I'm going to take her to an amazing Valentine's dinner."
195,Ross,"Do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks I'm the best boyfriend in the world, then I'm going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me."
196,Phoebe,If I haven't said it
197,Joey,"So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isn't going to happen."
198,Joey,It would be like you falling in love with a cat.
199,Phoebe,Hey!
200,Joey,Hey.
201,Phoebe,"Hey, buddy."
202,Phoebe,"How's my favorite dog, huh?"
203,Phoebe,How's my favorite dog?
204,Phoebe,You're subdued.
205,Phoebe,Did you give him a beer?
206,Joey,No.
207,Phoebe,"Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment."
208,Joey,"Yeah, sure."
209,Joey,Go ahead.
210,Joey,"Oh, me, right!"
211,Phoebe,He's miserable!
212,Phoebe,What happened to him?
213,Joey,Nothing.
214,Joey,We just talked about stuff.
215,Phoebe,What stuff?
216,Joey,Rachel stuff.
217,Phoebe,"OhJoey, you bummed him out!"
218,Phoebe,"This was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!"
219,Joey,He's breathing!
220,Phoebe,"Okay, I'm going to take him back to Wendy's."
221,Joey,"No, no, no, no!"
222,Joey,He's fine!
223,Joey,"Look, look, look!"
224,Joey,Here's your ball!
225,Joey,Get your ball!
226,Joey,Get your ball!
227,Joey,Get your ball!
228,Joey,"My God, what have I done to you, huh?"
229,Joey,I broke the dog!
230,Joey,"Pheebs, I broke the dog!"
231,Ross,"Well, I'm, uh, going to pick up Mona."
232,Ross,What have you got going tonight?
233,Rachel,"Oh, I've got big Valentine's plans!"
234,Rachel,"I've got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!"
235,Ross,"Y'know, it's interesting!"
236,Ross,"Most people think that's made with seawater, when in fact"
237,Rachel,"Ross, we actually watched the documentary together."
238,Rachel,Ooh!
239,Rachel,My Chinese food!
240,Rachel,Let me get my cash!
241,Ross,Mona?
242,Ross,What arehi!
243,Ross,What are you doing here?
244,Ross,"I'm, um, supposed to pick you up!"
245,Ross,Ayyyayyyy!
246,Rachel,"Oh, hey, Mona!"
247,Ross,I have no idea!
248,Rachel,I'll be watching TV if anybody needs me.
249,Ross,"Uhlately, she just likes hanging out here."
250,Ross,I think she's lonely.
251,Ross,I know.
252,Ross,"No, no."
253,Ross,She's way to emotional.
254,Ross,And by emotional I mean crazy.
255,Rachel,I'm not here!
256,Rachel,That's just my Chinese food!
257,Ross,Mm-hmm.
258,Ross,"She'sshe's emotional, but, but ballsy."
259,Rachel,You know what I'm going to do?
260,Rachel,"I'm going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed!"
261,Ross,And you thought she was going to be in our way!
262,Ross,"So, why don't you, uh, open the champagne, and I'll be right back."
263,Ross,I've got a surprise for you.
264,Ross,Please start drinking!
265,Rachel,I'm just going to grab the phone.
266,Rachel,"Oh, I'm sorry!"
267,Rachel,Do you need the phone?
268,Rachel,"But, but, Mona, I live here."
269,Ross,Happy Valentine's Day!
270,Ross,Or something to remember me by.
271,Monica,How long has it been this time?
272,Chandler,90 seconds.
273,Monica,That's better.
274,Monica,90 seconds is a long time not to think about itexcept all I did was think about it.
275,Chandler,"You know, it haunts me?"
276,Chandler,"Up til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy."
277,Chandler,"After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!"
278,Monica,"Okay, well, we have to get past this!"
279,Monica,Why don't we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?
280,Chandler,I can do that.
281,Monica,Okay.
282,Chandler,Okay.
283,Chandler,Now all we've got to do is get rid of this chair.
284,Monica,"Oh, thank God!"
285,Chandler,"Oh, I know!"
286,Monica,Come in!
287,Rachel,Hi!
288,Rachel,"I'm so sorry to barge in on your Valentine's, but I had to get away from all the yelling."
289,Rachel,Mona is dumping Ross.
290,Monica,"Oh, my God."
291,Chandler,Poor Ross.
292,Chandler,"Oh, great."
293,Chandler,"We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!"
294,Monica,"Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see?"
295,Monica,It's here.
296,Chandler,"Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch"
297,Rachel,Why?
298,Rachel,You saw it?
299,Rachel,Is it scary?
300,Chandler,"Well, let's just say it's ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself."
301,Rachel,"Well, now, wait."
302,Rachel,Now I'm all freaked out.
303,Rachel,"Come on, you guys will watch it with me."
304,Monica,"No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!"
305,Rachel,"C'mon, seriously, you guys, you're not going to make me watch this alone!"
306,Monica,She's rightof course not.
307,Monica,"Honey, get the tape."
308,Chandler,This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape.
309,Chandler,"Okay, here we go."
310,Rachel,Okay.
311,Rachel,"Ooh, my!"
312,Rachel,Woah!
313,Rachel,Why is that baby torturing that woman?
314,Chandler,Why have I seen this thing three times?
315,Monica,It'sstill beautiful.
316,Rachel,Uh!
317,Rachel,It's horrible!
318,Monica,I know!
319,Monica,"I know, I'm so sorry for you!"
320,Rachel,"Oh, my God!"
321,Chandler,"Wait, you guys, look!"
322,Rachel,What?
323,Rachel,Did her ass explode?
324,Chandler,"No, the baby's out!"
325,Chandler,"Look, look!"
326,Monica,"Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!"
327,Chandler,And look how happy the mom is now!
328,Monica,OhRach!
329,Rachel,"Oh, screw you guys, you don't have to do it!"
330,Ross,"Hey, hey, man!"
331,Joey,"Hey, what's up?"
332,Ross,UhMona just dumped me.
333,Joey,"Oh, man, I'm sorry."
334,Joey,Why?
335,Ross,"Well, with everything that's been going on lately, I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend."
336,Ross,"You know, I, uh, I didn't tell her I got Rachel pregnant."
337,Ross,"I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed!"
338,Ross,And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me.
339,Ross,"In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?"
340,Joey,"Still, that really sucks, man."
341,Joey,Especially on Valentine's Day.
342,Ross,Yeah.
343,Ross,Wait a minute.
344,Ross,What are you doing here?
345,Ross,Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine's Day?
346,Ross,"What's going on, huh?"
347,Ross,Girl trouble?
348,Joey,Sort of.
349,Ross,Really?
350,Joey,You don't have to seem so happy about it.
351,Ross,"Oh, sorry."
352,Ross,"Well, look, maybe I can help you with it."
353,Joey,"Oh, II d"
354,Ross,"Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me."
355,Ross,"Y'know, actually onceonce I got dumped during sex."
356,Ross,"Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?"
357,Joey,Forget about it.
358,Joey,It's no big deal.
359,Ross,C'mon!
360,Ross,Joey!
361,Ross,What is it?
362,Joey,It's nothing.
363,Ross,"Hey, hey, it's me."
364,Ross,Why can't you tell me?
365,Joey,"Okay, uhsit down."
366,Joey,Um there's this woman that I like.
367,Joey,A lot.
368,Joey,"But, uhit can't happen."
369,Ross,She's not a Tribbiani?
370,Joey,No!
371,Ross,I knew it.
372,Ross,"So, is she someone from work?"
373,Joey,Yes.
374,Ross,"Well, uh, does she like you?"
375,Joey,Sometimes I think maybe she could.
376,Joey,"But it doesn't matter, because I can't do anything about it."
377,Ross,Why not?
378,Joey,"Well, it's complicated."
379,Joey,She's with this other guy.
380,Joey,For a long time.
381,Joey,"Someone from work, too."
382,Joey,"And I could never do that to the guy, because we're really good friends."
383,Ross,"So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh is he still in love with her?"
384,Joey,No.
385,Joey,I don't think so.
386,Ross,Okay.
387,Ross,Um is he a good guy?
388,Joey,"Yeah, he's the best."
389,Ross,Then talk to him!
390,Ross,He might be fine with it.
391,Joey,"Oh, I don't know."
392,Ross,"Joey, it's worth finding out."
393,Ross,"I mean, if you really like her."
394,Joey,I do!
395,Joey,So much!
396,Joey,I can't stop thinking about her!
397,Joey,"I can't sleep, I"
398,Ross,"Okay, Joey, you know what?"
399,Ross,You have to go for it.
400,Ross,"How often does this happen to you, huh?"
401,Ross,You owe it to yourself.
402,Ross,"I'm going touhI'm going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home."
403,Joey,"Oh, yeah."
404,Ross,"Anyway seriously, uhjustjust talk to the guy, okay?"
405,Ross,And tell me how it goes.
406,Joey,It's Rachel.
407,Joey,Closing Credits
408,Rachel,"You're going to have a baby, and you need to be prepared."
409,Rachel,"Now, you're going to make yourself watch the whole thing."
410,Rachel,Just do it!
411,Rachel,Woman on
412,Rachel,Hmmmaybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.
413,Rachel,End
0,Joey,Hey!!
1,Joey,We are so in luck!
2,Joey,Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement.
3,Joey,Wait right there.
4,Chandler,"Oh no-no-no, I'm, I'm paddling away!"
5,Joey,Huh?
6,Chandler,Wow!
7,Chandler,Really?!
8,Chandler,We get all this rusty crap for free?
9,Joey,Uh-huh.
10,Joey,This and a bunch of bubble wrap.
11,Joey,"And, some of it is not even popped!"
12,Chandler,Could we be more white trash?
13,Chandler,Opening Credits
14,Monica,How desperate am I?
15,Rachel,Oh!
16,Rachel,"Good thing Chandler's not here, he always wins at this game."
17,Monica,I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
18,Phoebe,How come?
19,Monica,"Because I need the money, and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect."
20,Ross,"Come on, I think this is a good thing."
21,Ross,I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.
22,Monica,You don't have to stick up for her.
23,Monica,She can't here you.
24,Rachel,Hey!
25,Rachel,"Umm, do you guys have any juice?"
26,Joey,Just pickle.
27,Chandler,"Hey uh, Rach, funny story."
28,Chandler,"I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday."
29,Rachel,"My boss, Joanna?"
30,Rachel,"Wow, that must've been awkward."
31,Chandler,"Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink."
32,Rachel,"You ah, you didn't say Yes' to that did you?"
33,Chandler,No.
34,Chandler,No!
35,Chandler,"Well, not at first."
36,Rachel,What is she doing here?
37,Rachel,I don't understand!
38,Rachel,"Last time you went out with her you said she was a big, dull dud.'"
39,Chandler,"Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level."
40,Rachel,"Well, last time I almost got fired."
41,Rachel,"You must end it, you must end it now!"
42,Chandler,"Oh, come on!"
43,Chandler,It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me!
44,Chandler,I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself.
45,Rachel,Chandler!!
46,Rachel,"Promise me, you will end it."
47,Chandler,"Okay, I promise, I'll end it."
48,Rachel,Thank you.
49,Chandler,"I hope you know what I'm giving up for ya, because she's not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean."
50,Joey,Yeah-eh-eah!
51,Joey,"Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant."
52,Monica,"Doing great, the quiches are coming along."

55,Monica,Mrs.
56,Monica,Let me ask you a question.
57,Monica,Mrs.
58,Monica,Why did you hire me?
59,Monica,Mrs.
60,Monica,Oh my God!
61,Monica,Did you hear that?
62,Monica,She hired me because she thinks I'm good.
63,Phoebe,"Okay, I didn't hear that."
64,Monica,"Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I'm good."
65,Phoebe,Wow!
66,Phoebe,"And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian!"
67,Joey,Uhhhh.
68,Joey,The
69,Joey,No!
70,Joey,No.
71,Joey,"But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there."
72,Joey,The
73,Ross,I'm telling you it's totally unconstituional.
74,Ross,"Monica, Chandler, Phoebe, and"
75,Rachel,"Oh yeah, I totally agree."
76,Monica,I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.
77,Chandler,it was like the Algonquin kids table.
78,Chandler,The
79,Joey,Yeah-well-yeah!
80,Joey,Yeah-oh-yeah.
81,Joey,Come on in.
82,Phoebe,That's weird.
83,Monica,What?
84,Phoebe,Your nails.
85,Monica,"Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones."
86,Monica,I just did it so my Mom wouldn't give me grief about me biting them.
87,Phoebe,"Oh, no, I meant that it's weird that you only have nine now."
88,Monica,Oh my God.
89,Monica,"Wait a minute, I had them put  Oh my God!"
90,Monica,It's in the quiche!
91,Monica,Oh My God!
92,Phoebe,"Okay, don't panic."
93,Phoebe,"I'm gonna go to the store, I'm gonna get you another set of nails, no one's gonna know, and you're gonna look great."
94,Phoebe,Oh!
95,Phoebe,"Oh, it's cause they're gonna eatthat's the problem."
96,Phoebe,Mrs.
97,Monica,"Okay ah, please don't freak out."
98,Monica,"Umm, but ah, there's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there's no way to know which one."
99,Phoebe,And!
100,Phoebe,Whoever finds it wins the prize!
101,Phoebe,Mrs.
102,Monica,Then why are you laughing?
103,Monica,Mrs.
104,Monica,What?
105,Monica,You bet I'd lose a nail?
106,Monica,Mrs.
107,Monica,Frozen lasagnas?
108,Monica,Mrs.
109,Monica,You bet that I'd screw up?!
110,Monica,So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was Mrs.
111,Monica,"You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase."
112,Monica,Mrs.
113,Monica,That's right.
114,Monica,My Mom doesn't have any faith in me!
115,Monica,"Oh, that's hilarious!"
116,Monica,Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
117,Phoebe,I don't get it.
118,Phoebe,Mrs.
119,Monica,No!
120,Monica,You have lasagnas!
121,Phoebe,"Op, the ruined quiches are ready."
122,Chandler,It just doesn'tfeel like we're breaking up.
123,Chandler,Okay.
124,Chandler,"(They start kissing again, but are interrupted by the phone."
125,Chandler,Thanks.
126,Chandler,Okay.
127,Chandler,I'm getting dressed.
128,Chandler,When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
129,Chandler,What is it?
130,Chandler,"Ah-ha, you're not the boss of me."
131,Chandler,"Yeah, you are!"
132,Chandler,"Ooh, saucy."
133,Chandler,"You are, you're gonna leave me like this?"
134,Chandler,Okay.
135,Chandler,"But if you don't come back soon,  there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!"
136,Rachel,"That's weird, she locked the door."
137,Rachel,"Okay, swear you won't tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna's office."
138,Rachel,Do you wanna see the list?
139,Chandler,Hi!
140,Chandler,How are you?
141,Chandler,(Rachel and Sophie both back out and close the door without saying anything.
142,Chandler,Commercial Break
143,Chandler,"Hello, Joanna's office."

145,Chandler,"Look, this isn't funny!"
146,Chandler,You get back here right now!
147,Chandler,Why not?
148,Chandler,What?
149,Rachel,What?
150,Chandler,"Rachel, could I see you for a moment?"
151,Chandler,"Okay, here's the situation."
152,Chandler,The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door.
153,Chandler,Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me?
154,Chandler,"And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit."
155,Rachel,You promised you would break up with her!
156,Chandler,I did break up with her!
157,Chandler,"She just took it really, really well!"
158,Rachel,And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?
159,Chandler,It did enter my mind!
160,Chandler,"But then something happened that made it, shoot right out."
161,Rachel,"Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them."
162,Chandler,No-no-no-no-no-no-no!!
163,Chandler,I can't get myself right out of them!
164,Chandler,You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!!
165,Chandler,"Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and"
166,Rachel,"Oh, Chandler!!"
167,Rachel,"All right, this is it!"
168,Rachel,You never see Joanna again!
169,Chandler,Never!
170,Rachel,You never come into this office again!
171,Chandler,Fine!
172,Rachel,You give me back my Walkman!
173,Chandler,Inever borrowed your Walkman.
174,Rachel,"Well, then I lost it."
175,Rachel,You buy me one!
176,Chandler,You got it!
177,Chandler,Here we go!
178,Chandler,Come on!
179,Chandler,This is great!
180,Chandler,Ahhh!
181,Rachel,Does it hurt?
182,Chandler,"No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them."
183,Chandler,Hello sweet pants!
184,Rachel,Wait a minute!
185,Rachel,What are you gonna tell Joanna?
186,Chandler,About what?
187,Rachel,"When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I'm gonna get fired!"
188,Chandler,I'll make something up!
189,Chandler,"I'm good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!"
190,Rachel,"No, there's nothing to make up, she's gonna know that I have a key to her office, I've got to get you locked up back the way you were!"
191,Chandler,"Oh-ho-ho, I don't think so!"
192,Chandler,"Well, this is much better."
193,Joey,He cut off his ear.
194,Joey,The
195,Joey,I'm out.
196,Joey,The
197,Joey,Wow!
198,Joey,That's pretty nice.

200,Joey,What else you got in there?
201,Joey,The
202,Joey,In the woods.
203,Joey,"No wait-wait, that's the joke answer."

207,Phoebe,Hey!
208,Monica,Hi.
209,Phoebe,This used to be your room?
210,Phoebe,Wow!
211,Phoebe,You must've been in really good shape as a kid.
212,Monica,"Ohh, I'm such an idiot."
213,Monica,I can't believe I actually thought she could change.
214,Phoebe,"Well, who cares what your Mom thinks?"
215,Phoebe,So you pulled a Monica.
216,Monica,"Oh good, I'm glad that's catching on."
217,Phoebe,"No but, why does that have to be a bad thing."
218,Phoebe,Just change what it means.
219,Phoebe,Y'know?
220,Phoebe,Go down there and prove your Mother wrong.
221,Phoebe,"Finish the job you were hired to do, and we'll call that pulling a Monica."
222,Monica,What?
223,Phoebe,"Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A's, his parents would say, ""Yeah, he pulled a Monica."""
224,Phoebe,Y'know?
225,Phoebe,"Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, ""Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica."""
226,Phoebe,"Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, ""Yeah, that one's outta here."""
227,Phoebe,Though some things don't change.
228,Monica,"All right, I'll go down there."
229,Monica,"But, I'm not gonna serve the lasagna."
230,Monica,I'm gonna serve something I make.
231,Phoebe,Wow!
232,Phoebe,My breasts are really strong.
233,Rachel,Chandler!
234,Rachel,"Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she's very private about her office."
235,Rachel,Now I know why.
236,Chandler,"Hey, look, you're in trouble either way!"
237,Chandler,Okay?
238,Chandler,"If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she's gonna know you were in here."
239,Chandler,So you might as well just let me go.
240,Rachel,What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
241,Chandler,It still wouldn't be clean.
242,Chandler,All I want is my freedom.
243,Rachel,Foot rubs for a month!
244,Chandler,Freedom!
245,Rachel,I'll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!

261,Joey,You think I have $1200?
262,Joey,"I'm home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room."
263,Joey,I guess there's a few things you don't get from book learnin'.
264,Joey,The
265,Joey,"How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?"
266,Joey,The
267,Joey,You wanna see what I got?
268,Joey,Okay?
269,Joey,"I've got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man."
270,Joey,Hey!
271,Joey,The
272,Joey,And a 50.
273,Joey,"Huh, these must be Chandler's pants."
274,Joey,The
275,Joey,"Oh, I-I think I'm gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out."
276,Rachel,"I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts."
277,Chandler,No!
278,Rachel,I ah Oh!
279,Rachel,I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
280,Chandler,With extra pulp?
281,Rachel,Yeah!

283,Rachel,D'oh!!
284,Rachel,I've got it!
285,Chandler,You don't have it.
286,Rachel,I have so got it.
287,Rachel,"There's gonna be rumours about this, there's no way to stop it."
288,Rachel,"Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know."
289,Chandler,How do Monica and Phoebe know?
290,Rachel,"Oh, I called them."
291,Rachel,"And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous  or very  stingy."
292,Chandler,Go on.
293,Rachel,I can make you a legend.
294,Rachel,I can make you this generation's Milton Berle.
295,Chandler,And Milton Berle has a
296,Rachel,"Ohh, not compared to you."
297,Monica,Well?
298,Phoebe,They're not even touching the lasagna!
299,Monica,Really?
300,Phoebe,"Oh, they love your casserole."
301,Monica,Yes!
302,Phoebe,It's hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
303,Phoebe,Mrs.
304,Monica,And you?
305,Monica,Mrs.
306,Monica,"So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success."
307,Monica,Which would make you Mrs.
308,Monica,"Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word."
309,Monica,Mrs.
310,Monica,Wow!
311,Phoebe,"Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica."
312,Phoebe,She doesn't know we switched it.
313,Phoebe,Mrs.
314,Monica,That really means a lot.
315,Monica,"Oh, and Mom, don't bite your nails."
316,Chandler,Hello.
317,Chandler,"Joey, Rachel, and"
318,Ross,Hey!
319,Monica,"Hello, Chandler."

324,Phoebe,The guys both lean back laughing.]
325,Joey,No he doesn't!
326,Chandler,"Two hours, that lasted!"
327,Rachel,So did you break up with Joanna?
328,Chandler,I think so.
329,Joey,"Well, it's good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius."
330,Ross,The volcano?
331,Joey,Yeah.
332,Joey,"And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation."
333,Rachel,What?
334,Joey,"Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant."
335,Monica,Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
336,Joey,"Well, we can talk about something else."
337,Joey,What do you want to talk about?
338,Joey,Vivisection?
339,Joey,The Vasdeferens?
340,Joey,The Vietnam War?
341,Monica,Oh!
342,Monica,Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?
343,Phoebe,"Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country."
344,Ross,With such a sad history.
345,Chandler,Could there be more Kims?
346,Chandler,Closing Credits
347,Rachel,It's me!
348,Rachel,Good morning!
349,Rachel,"Yeah, sure."

6,Monica,Get it out of your system while we're alone.
7,Joey,Hey!
8,Phoebe,Yeah!
9,Phoebe,Have a great honeymoon!
10,Chandler,I'd better go pack.
11,Monica,"Oh no, I already packed."
12,Monica,The only thing I couldn't find though was your Speedo.
13,Chandler,A Speedo?
14,Chandler,"Uh, I don't have a Speedo."
15,Chandler,I'm gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit.
16,Rachel,Oh good you're still here!
17,Monica,Hey!
18,Rachel,I want to tell you to have a good honeymoon!
19,Monica,Thank you.

23,Rachel,What?
24,Joey,We know its Ross!
25,Rachel,How?!
26,Rachel,How do you know?

29,Monica,This is so great!
30,Monica,And I'm gonna be your baby's aunt!
31,Rachel,I know!
32,Phoebe,Me too!
33,Joey,I'm gonna be an uncle!
34,Joey,Come here!
35,Rachel,You're all gonna be aunts and uncles.
36,Monica,"Yeah, but I'm the only one related by blood."
37,Rachel,Okay.
38,Rachel,Great!
39,Rachel,So now that you guys all know you can help me.
40,Rachel,Give me some advice on how I'm gonna tell Ross!
41,Monica,"Well, what were you gonna say?"
42,Rachel,Well I was gonna tell him that I'm-I'm gonna have the baby and he can be as involved as he wants.
43,Joey,"Well that, that sounds good."
44,Rachel,Yeah but how do I start?
45,Rachel,"I mean, what's-what's the first thing that I say?"
46,Rachel,Okay great!
47,Rachel,Thanks.
48,Monica,Hey!
49,Monica,Good luck!
50,Phoebe,"Yeah, bye."
51,Joey,Bye.
52,Chandler,"Hey, what was that all about?"
53,Monica,"Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby."
54,Chandler,What?!
55,Chandler,I didn't even know thatWhy didn't you tell me?!
56,Chandler,Why am I talking like this?
57,Monica,I didn't think you could keep it a secret.
58,Chandler,What?!
59,Chandler,I am an excellent secret keeper.
60,Chandler,I have kept all of our secrets.
61,Joey,What secrets?
62,Chandler,"Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper."
63,Joey,You'll tell me later?
64,Chandler,You already know.
65,Chandler,Opening Credits
66,Phoebe,"Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon."
67,Joey,"Y'know, Monica and Chandler are married."
68,Joey,Ross and Rachel are having a baby.
69,Joey,Maybe you and I should do something.
70,Phoebe,All in good time my love.
71,Phoebe,All in good time.
72,Phoebe,Oh shoot!
73,Phoebe,I left my guitar in their apartment.
74,Phoebe,Well you can let me in later.
75,Joey,"I don't have a key, they took mine to give to you."
76,Phoebe,What?!
77,Phoebe,They took mine to give to you!
78,Joey,Why would they take away our keys?
79,Phoebe,Maybe they don't trust us.
80,Joey,No that's not it.
81,Joey,They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.
82,Phoebe,You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica's guest towels?
83,Joey,"Hey, I washed those!"
84,Phoebe,No you didn't.
85,Joey,Yeah that didn't sound like me.
86,Phoebe,"Well, what am I gonna do?"
87,Phoebe,I really need my guitar!
88,Joey,"Yeah, I have stuff in there too."
89,Phoebe,What stuff?
90,Joey,Monica's chicken parm!
91,Joey,I'll take care of it.
92,Joey,"Hey Mr. Treeger, it's Joey Tribbiani."
93,Joey,"Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler's apartment."
94,Joey,It's an emergency.
95,Joey,"Uhh, gas leak!"
96,Joey,"Yeah oh, and bring garlic bread."
97,Ross,Hey!
98,Phoebe,Did Rachel find you?
99,Ross,No why?
100,Phoebe,Oh she was looking for you.
101,Ross,"Oh well, I guess I'll catch up with her later."
102,Phoebe,"Well, she really wanted to talk to you now."
103,Joey,"Yeah, it seemed pretty important."
104,Ross,Oh no.
105,Phoebe,What?
106,Ross,I think I might know what this is about.
107,Joey,Really?
108,Ross,Yeah.
109,Ross,"Uh, uh we promised we weren't gonna tell anybody this but uh, about a month ago Rachel and I slept together."
110,Phoebe,And?
111,Ross,Wow!
112,Ross,I thought you would be a little more shocked.
113,Phoebe,Oh sorry.
114,Phoebe,And?
115,Ross,"Well, we-we said we'd just do it that one time but, but now I think she may wanna start things up again."
116,Joey,"Yeah, I don't think that's what it is."
117,Ross,Why?
118,Ross,What-what else could it be?
119,Joey,"Oh wow, I don't feel well."
120,Ross,I'm telling you.
121,Ross,I'm telling you.
122,Ross,That's what it is.
123,Ross,No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding.
124,Ross,She didn't say anything to you?
125,Phoebe,Maybe it's something you ate?
126,Joey,"Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel."
127,Ross,"Yeah, I guess I should."
128,Ross,"Man, y'know what I have to realize?"
129,Ross,Maybe I'm just not the type of guy women can have just one night with.
130,Ross,"Y'know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more."
131,Ross,I should remember that.
132,Monica,They're kissing let's just go around them.
133,Chandler,"Oh honey, leave them alone, they're in love."
134,Monica,I'm in love too!
135,Monica,But in an orderly fashion.
136,Monica,Ticket
137,Monica,Hi!
138,Monica,Can you do that and walk?
139,Monica,"Cause she said, ""Next."""
140,Monica,Did you hear that?!
141,Monica,They bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon!
142,Monica,Come on!
143,Monica,Let's act like we're on our honeymoon.
144,Chandler,We are on our honeymoon.
145,Monica,Grab my ass!
146,Monica,Ticket

150,Monica,Ticket
151,Monica,"Oh no, you see we're on our honeymoon."
152,Monica,"So umm, can you do your little thing and bump us up to first class?"
153,Monica,Ticket
154,Monica,"You see, if we'd gone around them like I said, weShe would've given us those tickets."
155,Monica,Damnit!
156,Chandler,"25J and K, any chance those aren't together?"
157,Joey,I still can't believe they took away my key.
158,Joey,You trust me with yours.
159,Phoebe,Of course I do!
160,Phoebe,And I'm gonna give it back to you as soon as they're done with it at the key shining place.
161,Joey,What the hell is that?
162,Joey,(They go into the hallway and see Mr. Treeger watching one of New York's bravest breakdown Monica and Chandler's door with an ax.]
163,Joey,Whoa!
164,Joey,Whoa!
165,Joey,Whoa!
166,Joey,"Treeger, what are you doing?"
167,Joey,Mr.

174,Monica,They're going into the first class lounge!
175,Monica,Do you know what they have in there?
176,Chandler,No.
177,Monica,Me neither!
178,Monica,We have to get in!
179,Chandler,Just act like you belong.
180,Monica,Oh my God!
181,Monica,Oranges!

208,Ross,"Uh, Ross and Rachel."
209,Ross,Rachel and Ross.
210,Ross,That's been one heck of a see-saw hasn't it?
211,Rachel,What?
212,Ross,"I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun andand certainly passionate, but don't you think it's better if we just stayed friends?"
213,Rachel,Seriously.
214,Rachel,What?
215,Ross,Okay.
216,Ross,Okay.
217,Ross,Y'know what?

221,Rachel,"Okay, y'know what?"
222,Rachel,"Can I, can I talk now?"

233,Rachel,Okay?
234,Rachel,I mean you can as involved as you want.
235,Ross,"Yeah, I need uh I'm justI don't knowI don't understand, umm, how this happened?"
236,Ross,We-we used a condom.
237,Rachel,I know.
238,Rachel,"I know, but y'know condoms only work like 97% of the time."
239,Ross,What?
240,Ross,What?
241,Ross,What?!!
242,Ross,Well they should put that on the box!!
243,Rachel,They do!
244,Ross,No they don't!!!
245,Ross,Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!
246,Rachel,Okay Ross come on let's just forget about the condoms.
247,Ross,Oh well I may as well have!
248,Rachel,"Listen, y'know what?"
249,Rachel,I was really freaked out too when I found out
250,Ross,Freaked out?
251,Ross,"Hey no, I'm not freaked out!"
252,Ross,I'm indignant!
253,Ross,As a consumer!
254,Rachel,Y'know what?
255,Rachel,"Let's, let's talk later."
256,Ross,No!
257,Ross,No!
258,Ross,I want to talk now!
259,Ross,Okay?
260,Ross,"IIn fact,  I am going to talk to the president of the condom company!"
261,Rachel,"Okay, y'know maybe I should come back"
262,Ross,Shh!
263,Ross,Shh!
264,Ross,Shh!
265,Rachel,Okay.

269,Joey,Mr.
270,Phoebe,Oh great!
271,Phoebe,"And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this?"
272,Phoebe,"Cause y'know umm, they don't-they don't have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them."
273,Phoebe,Mr.
274,Phoebe,Oh no.
275,Phoebe,Mr.
276,Ross,Hi.
277,Ross,Mr.
278,Ross,Sure.

283,Joey,So it's noticeable huh?
284,Ross,"Look, is Rachel here?"
285,Ross,I really need to talk to her.
286,Phoebe,Didn't you two already talk?
287,Ross,"Yeah but uh Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept together, but there's something else."
288,Ross,Rachel's pregnant.
289,Joey,Oh my God!!!
290,Joey,I can't believe that!
291,Phoebe,Holy mother of God!!
292,Ross,With my child.
293,Phoebe,That is brand new information!
294,Ross,You already know don't you?
295,Phoebe,A little bit.
296,Joey,How are you doing?
297,Ross,Okay.
298,Ross,Okay.
299,Ross,I mean I'll be okay.
300,Ross,It's just I don't think I handled it very well.
301,Joey,"Well, what did you say to her?"
302,Ross,Nothing.
303,Ross,But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful.
304,Ross,And then when I turned around she was gone.
305,Phoebe,Oh Ross.
306,Ross,"But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective."
307,Joey,What?
308,Ross,I gotta go find her.
309,Joey,Whoa!
310,Joey,Hey!
311,Joey,Whoa!!
312,Joey,Hold up!
313,Joey,Are you serious?!
314,Joey,So like 3% of the time they don't even work?!
315,Joey,Huh?
316,Joey,They should put that on the box!
317,Ross,Evidently they do.
318,Joey,What?
319,Monica,I can't believe we're here.
320,Chandler,Oh you've got to be kidding me.
321,Monica,What?
322,Monica,Front Desk

326,Monica,Yeah!
327,Monica,You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge!
328,Monica,I mean we should get free stuff too!
329,Monica,I mean you're not the only ones on your honeymoon!
330,Chandler,We need the stuff.
331,Joey,Hey Monica it's Joey.
332,Joey,"Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin' from your apartment."
333,Monica,What?
334,Monica,Are you serious?!
335,Monica,Joey smells gas!
336,Chandler,What else is new?
337,Joey,"Yeah and we'd go check it out, but you took away our keys."
338,Monica,Well do something!
339,Monica,Get in there!
340,Joey,How?
341,Joey,I guess I could break down your door.
342,Monica,Yeah!
343,Monica,Do that!
344,Joey,And-and you won't blame us for any damage?
345,Monica,No!
346,Monica,Are you doing it?!
347,Monica,I don't hear anything!
348,Monica,Come on!
349,Joey,"Uh, okay I'll-I'll-I'll break it down."
350,Phoebe,"Oh hey hi, he's doing it."
351,Phoebe,He's breaking down the door.
352,Phoebe,"Okay, we're in."
353,Rachel,"If I said I was, would you judge me?"
354,Rachel,Okay.
355,Rachel,"Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery Barn"
356,Ross,Hi!
357,Rachel,Hi!
358,Ross,Uh we-we need to talk.
359,Rachel,"Uh-uh-uh, right now?"
360,Rachel,Because I've kinda got an el fresco situation going on over here.
361,Ross,"Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today."
362,Rachel,"Okay Ross that's fine, but can you please stand near my head?"
363,Ross,What?
364,Ross,Oh yeah.
365,Ross,I'm sorry.
366,Ross,I mean I-I think I went a little crazy.
367,Ross,I mean I was thinking about myself when I  reallyI should have been thinking about you Rach
368,Rachel,Okay.
369,Rachel,Head Ross!
370,Rachel,Head Ross!
371,Rachel,Head Ross!
372,Ross,Right!
373,Ross,Right!
374,Ross,"I justI want you to know that I'm going to be there through this whole thing, okay?"
375,Ross,Okay?
376,Ross,"The doctor's appointments, the uh, the Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartmentAlthough we could probably worry about that til after we get married."
377,Rachel,What married?
378,Ross,"Well yeah, I think we should get married."
379,Rachel,"What, because that's your answer to everything?"
380,Ross,"No, because that's the right thing to do."
381,Rachel,"Yeah, maybe if you're in love."
382,Rachel,"But Ross, we are not in love, are we?"
383,Ross,No butbut still you can't possibly do this alone.
384,Rachel,Excuse me?
385,Ross,"Come on Rach, you can't even eat alone in a restaurant."
386,Rachel,What?
387,Ross,"I'm just saying if you can't eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?"
388,Rachel,I can too eat by myself!
389,Ross,When have you ever?
390,Rachel,When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!
391,Ross,Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!
392,Rachel,"Oh please, you inhale your food!"
393,Ross,I grew up with Monica!
394,Ross,If you didn't eat fast you didn't eat!!
395,Ross,Dr.
396,Rachel,"Oh no Dr. Long, please come in."
397,Rachel,"This is Ross, he is the father."
398,Ross,"But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone."
399,Ross,Dr.
400,Ross,I don't know why you can't admit that you need me.
401,Rachel,I do need you!
402,Rachel,I need you to stand near my head!
403,Rachel,Dr.

417,Rachel,I didn't want her to think I was a terrible mother!
418,Rachel,I can't even see my own baby!
419,Ross,"Oh sure, come here!"
420,Ross,Sure you can!
421,Ross,"Uh, look come here look,  it's-it's-it's, it's right there ."

427,Ross,Come on!
428,Ross,Come on!
429,Ross,"Here, okay-okay, you see this?"

4,Chandler,There are no other guys here!
5,Rachel,"Chandler, there's a guy right over there."
6,Chandler,That's a mailman!
7,Chandler,That's our mailman!
8,Chandler,Hi.
9,Chandler,How are ya?
10,Rachel,"Chandler, don't worry!"
11,Rachel,This doesn't make you any less of a guy!
12,Rachel,That does!
13,Rachel,What am I sitting on?
14,Rachel,I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
15,Chandler,"Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?"
16,Rachel,Hmm.
17,Monica,Joey let me ask you a question.
18,Monica,What does this light switch do?
19,Joey,"Ohh, Nothing."
20,Monica,Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
21,Joey,I know what it did!
22,Joey,Nothing.
23,Monica,They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something!
24,Monica,How can you not care?
25,Joey,Like this.
26,Rachel,"Well, here's another question for ya."
27,Rachel,"Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?"
28,Joey,Sure!
29,Joey,It flushes it.
30,Rachel,"Okay, good."
31,Rachel,"Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?"
32,Chandler,Hello!
33,Joey,Hey!
34,Joey,Ah!
35,Rachel,Guess who we ran into today?
36,Monica,Janice?
37,Chandler,Isn't this amazing?
38,Monica,How have you been?
39,Phoebe,"Ohhh, wow."
40,Joey,And there it is.
41,Chandler,Okay.
42,Chandler,Bye.
43,Chandler,Bye.
44,Chandler,Bye.
45,Chandler,B-bye!
46,Chandler,Bye.
47,Chandler,I can't stand the woman!
48,Phoebe,What?!
49,Phoebe,I thought you were crazy about her!
50,Chandler,"Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love?"
51,Chandler,"Like her voice, her laugh, her personalityWell, they're all back!"
52,Chandler,Y'know?
53,Chandler,And she's picked up like nine new ones!
54,Joey,So what are you doing bringing her here?!
55,Joey,There's people here!
56,Chandler,Don't worry about it.
57,Chandler,I'm taking care of it tonight.
58,Rachel,You are not.
59,Rachel,You have never been able to break up with her.
60,Chandler,"Well, I don't have to break up with her this time."
61,Chandler,We're not involved!
62,Chandler,I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike!
63,Chandler,I'm going to end it with her before it starts.
64,Chandler,My ass is like frozen!
65,Joey,"Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes."
66,Joey,I'm tellin' ya!
67,Ross,"No, it's really not that bad."
68,Ross,"I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe."
69,Ross,Help!
70,Ross,Help!!
71,Ross,Help!
72,Ross,Help!
73,Ross,"Oh hey, that was a good one, huh?"
74,Ross,Help!
75,Ross,Help!
76,Ross,"Oh, Liam."
77,Ross,"So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or somethingor should I call it  football?"
78,Ross,"What's ah, what's so funny about that?"
79,Ross,"Well, we didn't have freedom here until 1776, either so"
80,Ross,Cheers!
81,Chandler,"Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River."
82,Chandler,"Okay, we have to talk."
83,Chandler,I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship
84,Chandler,Right!
85,Chandler,I just think that this is happening too soon.
86,Chandler,I hear ya.
87,Chandler,But!
88,Chandler,"Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!"
89,Chandler,No!
90,Chandler,No!
91,Chandler,"Not, Paris."
92,Chandler,"Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?"
93,Chandler,Yemen.
94,Chandler,"That's right, yes, I'm being transferred to Yemen!"
95,Chandler,I don't know exactly.
96,Chandler,But I do know that it's some time tomorrow.
97,Monica,Done?
98,Phoebe,Yep!
99,Rachel,Hey!
100,Joey,Hey!
101,Joey,What's up?
102,Monica,This switch thing has been driving me crazy.
103,Monica,So I turned it off and checked every outlet.
104,Monica,"Now, four of them don't work."
105,Monica,"Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch."
106,Monica,"So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is."
107,Joey,I bet I stopped listening before you did.
108,Rachel,"Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light."
109,Monica,"Yeah, well, I'm using noise."
110,Monica,Okay.
111,Monica,All right!
112,Monica,"So, is everybody ready?"
113,Monica,Here we go.
114,Monica,I hear something!
115,Monica,I hear something!
116,Monica,Where is it?
117,Rachel,It's coming from Joey!
118,Phoebe,"Oh my God, that's so freaky!"
119,Phoebe,Turn him off!
120,Phoebe,"Ooh, hey, could we put on the news?"
121,Phoebe,I think it might be raining.
122,Ross,"Oh, just hold on a second."
123,Ross,I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN.
124,Ross,I don't know what the big deal is.
125,Ross,I'm man enough to play this sport.
126,Joey,"Dude, you're not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport."
127,Ross,Hey!
128,Phoebe,Janice.
129,Chandler,"Y'know uh, you didn't really have to help me pack."
130,Chandler,"Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!"
131,Joey,"Hey-hey, what's going on?"
132,Chandler,"Oh, I'm packing."
133,Chandler,Y'know I'm-I'm packing cause I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
134,Joey,Thanks for telling me!
135,Chandler,"I'm only going to pretend I'm moving to Yemen, it's the only way I can get rid off her."
136,Joey,"Ohhhh, good one!"
137,Joey,And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
138,Phoebe,"Yeah, I know, I do that cause it makes me look taller."
139,Chandler,Okay.
140,Chandler,"Joey, trade lives with me!"
141,Joey,Nope.
142,Joey,Man look at this!
143,Joey,"Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play rugby."
144,Joey,I mean look how brutal this is!
145,Ross,"Hey, I can handle it!"
146,Ross,All right?
147,Rachel,"Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad."
148,Ross,That's cause-cause you're mom's dog kept-kept looking at me.
149,Joey,"Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here."
150,Joey,"That's called a scrum, okay?"
151,Joey,It's kinda like a huddle.
152,Ross,"And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?"
153,Joey,Ross!
154,Joey,They're gonna kill you!
155,Phoebe,"Well, why are you doing this anyway?"
156,Ross,"Well, you should've seen the guy that she used to go out with."
157,Ross,"I mean, he's like Joe Rugby."
158,Phoebe,You're kidding!
159,Phoebe,And he plays rugby?!
160,Phoebe,That's so funny.
161,Phoebe,Ohh!
162,Phoebe,I see how you did that.
163,Phoebe,All right.
164,Ross,"Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious."
165,Ross,So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am!
166,Rachel,I'm sorry.
167,Rachel,I'm sorry.
168,Rachel,"You're right, you are a tough guy."
169,Rachel,You're the toughest palaeontologist I know.
170,Joey,"All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself!"
171,Joey,It's not like he'sChandler!
172,Chandler,Thanks!
173,Ross,"Look, don't worry about me."
174,Ross,Okay?
175,Ross,I'll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball.
176,Ross,"I'll uh, I'll be that guy right out of the circle."
177,Rachel,"Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin' at him."
178,Rachel,Commercial Break
179,Joey,Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross!
180,Joey,"Stay away from that guy , and that guy ."
181,Joey,And that oneDude!
182,Joey,They're all huge!
183,Ross,They don't look any bigger than me!
184,Joey,"Well, maybe that's because you're closer to you."
185,Joey,So you look bigger to you from where you are.
186,Ross,All right.
187,Phoebe,Hi.
188,Phoebe,Whoa!
189,Phoebe,I kinda liked it.
190,Ross,"Okay, I know what I have to do."
191,Ross,I've got to go Red Ross.
192,Ross,"Y'know, Red Ross!"
193,Joey,I totally don't know what you're talking about.
194,Ross,Come on!
195,Ross,The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?!
196,Ross,Screamed at him!
197,Ross,Turned all red!
198,Ross,Red Ross!
199,Joey,No.
200,Ross,You'll see.
201,Ross,JOEY!!!!!
202,Rachel,Youarenot going to believe it!
203,Rachel,"Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?"
204,Monica,He asked you out?
205,Rachel,No.
206,Rachel,But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
207,Monica,Saucy!
208,Rachel,What are these?
209,Monica,Electrical plans for the building.
210,Rachel,"Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?"
211,Monica,"I know that switch does something, okay?"
212,Monica,So-so I went down to city hall and got these.
213,Monica,All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
214,Rachel,Wow!
215,Rachel,If only more people knew.
216,Chandler,"Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport."
217,Chandler,"Well, we're really not that close."
218,Chandler,"Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then."
219,Chandler,Okay.
220,Chandler,"Then I guess it's just, wait here then."
221,Chandler,Hi.
222,Chandler,I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
223,Chandler,Ticket Counter
224,Chandler,"Oh no-no-no, no."
225,Chandler,"No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket."
226,Chandler,Ticket Counter
227,Chandler,What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
228,Chandler,Ticket Counter
229,Chandler,No.
230,Chandler,"All right, y'know what, she's  gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card, but what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card."
231,Chandler,Ticket Counter
232,Chandler,American Express?
233,Phoebe,"No offence but, y'know sometimes it's hard to understand you, y'know with the accent, so"
234,Ross,Did you see me?
235,Ross,"I was pretty good, huh?"
236,Ross,That is one fun game!
237,Ross,"Hey, could you do me a favour?"
238,Ross,Could you just grab me a bottle of water?
239,Ross,Thanks.
240,Ross,I-I think I'm dying.
241,Ross,I really do.
242,Phoebe,"Oh, poor baby."
243,Ross,Tell my son that I love him.
244,Ross,Excellent!
245,Ross,"Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!"
246,Ross,That's not true!
247,Phoebe,She's right!
248,Phoebe,You have to stop!
249,Ross,What?
250,Ross,No!
251,Ross,"No, I'm not stopping."
252,Ross,I'm Red Ross!
253,Joey,"Dude, if you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross!"
254,Ross,I don't care!
255,Ross,I am not quitting!
256,Ross,I insist on finishing this game!
257,Ross,"No, God no!"
258,Ross,That is no place for a woman.
259,Ross,Those guys will grab anything.
260,Ross,I like that.
261,Ross,Huh?
262,Ross,"All right, bad ankle, got it!"
263,Ross,Yeah?
264,Ross,"I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay!"
265,Ross,Okay!
266,Ross,"But-but, Liam's on my team."
267,Ross,I'm gonna go get him!
268,Ross,"Okay, I am going back in!"
269,Joey,The Red Ross!
270,Joey,Okay.
271,Rachel,Hey!
272,Monica,Hi!
273,Rachel,What-what are-what are these?
274,Monica,"Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up."
275,Monica,I thought they'd brighten up the place.
276,Monica,They do don't you think?
277,Monica,"No-no-no, no!"
278,Monica,"I know that there's no hole there, I just really liked that picture."
279,Rachel,Oh my God!
280,Rachel,Look at this!
281,Monica,"Okay, but there is a wire back there!"
282,Monica,I mean that switch is connected to something!
283,Rachel,I don't care!
284,Rachel,The wires have come loose in your head!
285,Monica,I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
286,Rachel,And did you?
287,Monica,No.
288,Monica,It disappears back there behind that baseboard.
289,Monica,"For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs."
290,Monica,But it didn't.
291,Monica,Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
292,Rachel,Oh my God.
293,Rachel,Mrs.
294,Rachel,"Hello, Mrs. Chatracus."
295,Phoebe,"Now, are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor?"
296,Ross,Oh no!
297,Ross,That-that'll just bring me down!
298,Ross,This was great!
299,Ross,I mean I-I-I was great!
300,Ross,This is a great day!
301,Ross,Y'know what?
302,Ross,I'm buying everyone coffee.
303,Ross,All right?
304,Ross,"If someone would just grab my wallet, it's in my pocket."
305,Joey,"Yeah, sure."
306,Ross,"No, not you."
307,Joey,"Uhh, look, your eye's still popping out a little, I'm gonna go get some ice."
308,Phoebe,"Ooh, ice!"
309,Phoebe,I am so in the mood for ice!
310,Ross,"Oh, I kinda was, wasn't I?"
311,Ross,I made a man twice my size cry.
312,Ross,"I mean, I haven't done that since I was four and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks."
313,Ross,Please!
314,Ross,Are you kidding?
315,Ross,"I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody noseI mean I-I'm not proud of it but, I really am."
316,Ross,"And it's all because of you, wonderful, amazing you."
317,Ross,"No, no, I'm serious."
318,Ross,Thank you.
319,Ross,It's worth the pain.
320,Ross,"Y'know what, you know what?"
321,Ross,It's not.
322,Chandler,"Well, I-I guess I gotta go."
323,Chandler,"Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel."
324,Chandler,"Okay, good-bye."
325,Chandler,Good-bye.
326,Chandler,No!
327,Chandler,Janice!
328,Chandler,There you are!
329,Chandler,There you are!
330,Chandler,"I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!"
331,Chandler,"Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen!"
332,Chandler,I'm going to Yemen!
333,Chandler,"When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?"
334,Chandler,Closing Credits
335,Monica,All right.
336,Monica,The super couldn't figure out what it did.
337,Monica,A $200 an hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did.
338,Monica,I've had seven pretty serious shocks.
339,Monica,I officially give up.
340,Rachel,Thank God.
341,Monica,"I guess Joey was right, it does nothing."
342,Phoebe,See?
343,Phoebe,I'm doing it.
344,Phoebe,I am totally doing it.
345,Phoebe,I lost it.
346,Phoebe,End
0,Chandler,Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
1,Joey,"No, look."
2,Chandler,That's a pig.
3,Joey,"I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her."
4,Chandler,Hey!
5,Ross,Emily's cousin kicked me out!
6,Chandler,What?
7,Joey,Why?
8,Ross,"Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back."
9,Chandler,How can he do that?
10,Chandler,Didn't you sign a lease?
11,Ross,Who needs a lease when it's family!
12,Joey,"Hey, you can stay with us!"
13,Joey,We'll take care of ya!
14,Chandler,"Oh, yeah!"
15,Chandler,Absolutely!
16,Chandler,Anything you need man!
17,Chandler,But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
18,Joey,Yeah.
19,Ross,You got it.
20,Joey,Okay.
21,Ross,"Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this."
22,Ross,"All right, I'm gonna get packing again."
23,Ross,"Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad."
24,Ross,What?
25,Chandler,He thought you said gonad.
26,Chandler,Opening Credits
27,Monica,"Oh, Larry."
28,Phoebe,"Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?"
29,Phoebe,It's okay to laugh right?
30,Phoebe,Okay.
31,Monica,"Okay, knock yourself out, Larry."
32,Phoebe,Yum-my!
33,Monica,Larry?
34,Phoebe,Oh yeah!
35,Phoebe,I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
36,Monica,"Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen."
37,Monica,"It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it."
38,Phoebe,"Hey, you should really read that book you wrote."
39,Phoebe,Wow!
40,Phoebe,You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it.
41,Phoebe,You can have your own health inspector detective show!
42,Phoebe,"Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda."
43,Phoebe,"Okay, she would love that!"
44,Phoebe,"Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat."
45,Phoebe,Okay.
46,Phoebe,He's so funny!
47,Monica,Thanks.
48,Rachel,Thank you.
49,Rachel,Mon?
50,Monica,Hmm?
51,Rachel,How's Ross doing?
52,Rachel,Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
53,Monica,"He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it."
54,Monica,"Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try"
55,Rachel,"Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again."
56,Rachel,"I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time."
57,Rachel,"And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced."
58,Monica,"Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married."
59,Monica,Danny.
60,Monica,Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
61,Rachel,I don't know!
62,Rachel,He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out.
63,Rachel,"I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing."
64,Rachel,Hi Danny!
65,Rachel,Wow!
66,Rachel,Thirsty huh?
67,Monica,"Ohh, fun!"
68,Rachel,"Ohh, great!"
69,Rachel,Yeah.
70,Monica,"Well, I guess we won't be warming his house."
71,Rachel,Okay.
72,Rachel,"All right, I see what he's doing!"
73,Rachel,"He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out."
74,Monica,And you're not gonna do that.
75,Rachel,That's right!
76,Rachel,'Cause that would give him the control!
77,Rachel,"So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation."
78,Rachel,"Blew up in his face, didn't it?"
79,Monica,So-so there is no party.
80,Rachel,"No, there's a party."
81,Rachel,There's a party.
82,Rachel,"But the power, that is still up for grabs."
83,Rachel,You follow me?
84,Monica,I think so.
85,Monica,"Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you."
86,Rachel,Exactly.
87,Joey,Ross?
88,Ross,Hey roomies!
89,Chandler,Love what you've done with the place.
90,Ross,"Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here."
91,Joey,Not a problem.
92,Joey,"And listen, hey!"
93,Joey,"Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don'tI was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine."
94,Chandler,Oh yeah!
95,Ross,"Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little."
96,Ross,Check this out.
97,Ross,"We will, we will, call you back!"
98,Joey,"Hey, all right!"
99,Ross,"Pretty cool, huh?"
100,Joey,"You're fake laughing too, right?"
101,Chandler,"Oh, the tears are real."
102,Phoebe,Show me the badge again.
103,Phoebe,Shiny.
104,Phoebe,You are just nonstop!
105,Phoebe,Why?
106,Phoebe,You have the power to do that?
107,Phoebe,Shut it down.
108,Joey,Hey.
109,Chandler,What are you doing?
110,Joey,Nothing.
111,Chandler,You built a fort didn't ya?
112,Joey,Kinda.
113,Chandler,"Oh my God, the air purifier!"
114,Chandler,Ross's air purifier!
115,Chandler,All I heard through 4 years of college was
116,Joey,"Dude, you should've gone out once and a while."
117,Chandler,I hate this thing!
118,Joey,"Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend."
119,Joey,"He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!"
120,Rachel,"Oh, hi Danny."
121,Monica,"Oh, thanks!"
122,Monica,We'll try to stop by.
123,Rachel,"Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy."
124,Monica,You are?
125,Rachel,Yeah!
126,Rachel,"Remember I got that uh, gala."
127,Rachel,"It's a uh, regatta gala."
128,Rachel,"No-no, but I support it."
129,Monica,Okay.
130,Rachel,Okay.
131,Rachel,Walked right into that one didn't he?
132,Monica,What one?
133,Monica,You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
134,Rachel,"Yeah, but he waited until the last minute!"
135,Rachel,"So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party."
136,Rachel,"I said, ""No!"""
137,Rachel,Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
138,Monica,Great.
139,Monica,So the ball is in his court?
140,Rachel,Ball?
141,Rachel,There is no ball.
142,Ross,"Joey, please!"
143,Joey,Sorry.
144,Joey,"Ahhhhhhhhhh  , and lower it a couple of inches, so that the fingers are pointing at your wrist."
145,Joey,"Now take your arms and keeping the elbows bent and your hands in front of you spread out your arms, kinda like making a bird's wing."
146,Joey,Now hunch your shoulders over and move you hands up and down as if you are trying to tell some one to turn it down.
147,Joey,That's Ross 'quiet down' maneuver.
148,Joey,"Well, there is an accompanying face, but I don't want to try and describe it as well.)"
149,Chandler,Hello children!
150,Joey,Hey!
151,Joey,Wanna play some foosball?
152,Joey,Please?
153,Chandler,Okay.
154,Joey,"No-no, no!"
155,Joey,"We have to move the table into my room, yeah!"
156,Joey,'Cause of all the boxes.
157,Joey,Come on!
158,Joey,"All right, I have one question."
159,Joey,What is the deal with this?
160,Chandler,Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
161,Joey,"No, the quiet down thing!"
162,Chandler,You mean this.
163,Joey,Um-hmm!
164,Joey,"Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take!"
165,Joey,Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs!
166,Joey,My God!
167,Joey,What if that had been porn?
168,Chandler,"All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross!"
169,Chandler,I survived college with him!
170,Joey,"All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer."
171,Joey,Let's have a game.
172,Chandler,Okay.
173,Chandler,No-no-no-no!
174,Joey,YES!
175,Ross,"Uh fellas,"
176,Chandler,"Okay, so he's out of here."
177,Joey,Um-hmm.
178,Joey,Commercial Break
179,Joey,Hey!
180,Monica,Hey!
181,Joey,You guys got anything to eat?
182,Joey,I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
183,Phoebe,"Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated."
184,Phoebe,So we shut it down!
185,Joey,"Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?"
186,Monica,"I don't know, clean places?"
187,Joey,"Umm, yum!"
188,Monica,It's Danny.
189,Rachel,Don't let him in!
190,Rachel,I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
191,Monica,We'll be right there!
192,Monica,Can't you just say it starts later?
193,Rachel,What?
194,Rachel,What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?
195,Monica,The fake kind!
196,Monica,We have a ladle.
197,Monica,"Okay, great!"
198,Phoebe,"Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say?"
199,Phoebe,"He would say, ""See you ladle."""
200,Chandler,"Well, I-I-I'm done with this."
201,Chandler,You want anything Ross?
202,Chandler,Sports?
203,Chandler,International?
204,Chandler,Apartment listings?
205,Ross,I'll take sports.
206,Joey,Mine!
207,Ross,All right.
208,Ross,"Uhh, international."
209,Joey,Oh that's mine too!
210,Joey,I'm Italian!
211,Ross,"Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here."
212,Chandler,Not even on page 7?
213,Ross,Oh yeah!
214,Ross,"You'rehey, you're right!"
215,Ross,"Here's an affordable place,  two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!"
216,Chandler,What about that circled one?
217,Ross,"Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio."
218,Joey,But it's available now!
219,Joey,Isn't it?
220,Chandler,"Yes, it is."
221,Joey,"Hey, let's go look at it!"
222,Ross,"Okay, let's go."
223,Joey,Okay!
224,Chandler,There we go!
225,Ross,"Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier?"
226,Ross,"I mean after all, we all are using it."
227,Chandler,Let's go quicker.
228,Joey,Yeah!
229,Ross,Oh my God!
230,Chandler,"Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom."
231,Chandler,Well that's great!
232,Chandler,Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
233,Joey,Somebody was using his head.
234,Joey,"Hey, let's check out the rest of the place."
235,Ross,I think this is it.
236,Ross,"I don't know, maybe we should keep looking."
237,Joey,"But hey, Ross, this place is available now!"
238,Chandler,"Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks."
239,Joey,Yeah.
240,Ross,"So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?"
241,Joey,"Oh, it's perfect!"
242,Ross,How about you?
243,Chandler,It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
244,Ross,"All right, I see what you guys are saying."
245,Ross,"I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application."
246,Chandler,We are bad people.
247,Joey,He knew we were trying to get rid of him.
248,Joey,He knew!
249,Joey,You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
250,Phoebe,"Ooh, absolutely!"
251,Phoebe,"Ooh, I love that place!"
252,Phoebe,"So, no."
253,Phoebe,Enh.
254,Phoebe,Sure!
255,Phoebe,"Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy!"
256,Phoebe,Thatthis milk is mine.
257,Phoebe,"I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know."
258,Phoebe,"Okay, let's go!"
259,Phoebe,"Okay, stop!"
260,Phoebe,"Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy?"
261,Phoebe,"Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?"
262,Phoebe,Thank you.
263,Phoebe,"Okay, go!"
264,Phoebe,Go!
265,Phoebe,Go!
266,Phoebe,"Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose."
267,Joey,"Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!"
268,Chandler,Yes that was a nice place!
269,Joey,Yeah!
270,Chandler,"Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!"
271,Joey,Yeah!
272,Chandler,What are we gonna do?
273,Joey,I don't know.
274,Joey,Maybe pizza?
275,Chandler,About Ross!
276,Joey,Oh!
277,Joey,Oh!
278,Joey,Hello!
279,Joey,Oh yeah!
280,Joey,It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references.
281,Joey,Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet!
282,Joey,"Yeah, he's very reliable."
283,Chandler,Of course he has this big huge dog!
284,Chandler,"That uh, barks into the night."
285,Chandler,"Well, who doesn't love dogs?"
286,Chandler,"Ah, he's a tap dancer!"
287,Chandler,"Yes, some would say that is a lost art."
288,Chandler,He's a pimp!
289,Chandler,There you go!
290,Chandler,"Yes, he's a pimp."
291,Chandler,"He's a big, tap dancing pimp!"
292,Chandler,Hello?
293,Chandler,Ohhhhh!
294,Rachel,"Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work!"
295,Rachel,He's right there!
296,Monica,Just go over and say hi.
297,Rachel,"No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala."
298,Rachel,Okay?
299,Rachel,So just go distract him.
300,Rachel,But don't be sexy.
301,Monica,"Hey, Danny!"
302,Monica,"Oh, it's a great party!"
303,Monica,Great food.
304,Monica,"Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa."
305,Monica,"So umm, what's this?"
306,Monica,Ooooh!
307,Monica,And-and-and what-what's this?
308,Monica,Oh.
309,Rachel,Hey!
310,Rachel,"Oh right, tonight was your party."
311,Rachel,"Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime."
312,Rachel,"Yeah, sure."
313,Rachel,"All right, whose court is the ball in now?"
314,Monica,I thought there wasn't a ball?
315,Rachel,"Oh, come on!"
316,Rachel,"He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!"
317,Rachel,"Oh, go on!"
318,Rachel,You telling people about me?
319,Rachel,"Yeah, okay, at ease solider!"
320,Rachel,"No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy."
321,Rachel,I know what's going on here.
322,Rachel,Your Danny's wingman right?
323,Rachel,You guys are best buds.
324,Rachel,Frat bros!
325,Rachel,"Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend."
326,Rachel,"You tell him, ""Nice try."""
327,Rachel,Man!
328,Rachel,He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!
329,Monica,I think I need a drink.
330,Rachel,Yeah!
331,Chandler,98.
332,Chandler,99.
333,Chandler,100.
334,Chandler,"Okay, go!"
335,Joey,"Dude, I'm telling ya!"
336,Joey,I'm fine!
337,Chandler,Here we go!
338,Chandler,Here we go!
339,Joey,Hey!
340,Chandler,Hey!
341,Ross,Hey.
342,Ross,"So I uh, I didn't get that apartment."
343,Ross,Some problem with my application.
344,Joey,You're kidding!
345,Chandler,"You're kidding, no!"
346,Ross,Yeah.
347,Ross,"But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while."
348,Ross,So
349,Joey,"But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross!"
350,Joey,We're-we're roomies!
351,Ross,"Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space."
352,Joey,"Well, we got plenty of space!"
353,Joey,There-there's still some over there  by-by that speaker.
354,Joey,"Please, just stay!"
355,Chandler,Yeah!
356,Ross,Are you guys sure about this?
357,Joey,Definitely!
358,Chandler,Yes!
359,Chandler,"Ross, you have to stay!"
360,Ross,All right.
361,Joey,All right!
362,Chandler,"All right, buddy!"
363,Ross,So I'm a pimp huh?
364,Ross,It's okay!
365,Ross,"Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me."
366,Ross,Tell me if something is bothering you.
367,Ross,Okay?
368,Ross,And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just .
369,Ross,Ending Credits
370,Chandler,"Well, I see you've had a very productive day."
371,Chandler,Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
372,Ross,"Come on, it's fun!"
373,Chandler,All right!
374,Chandler,Isn't this a woman's hat?
375,Joey,"Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!"
376,Joey,End
0,Chandler,Hey!
1,Monica,"Good morning, Tiger!"
2,Monica,I'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight.
3,Monica,You're gonna get me good and pregnant.
4,Chandler,I've got nowhere to go this morning.
5,Chandler,I'm unemployed!
6,Chandler,I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.
7,Monica,"Well, I just lost my erection."
8,Chandler,"I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?"
9,Monica,You're supposed to find your passion in life.
10,Monica,You can be whatever you wanna be now.
11,Monica,It's exciting.
12,Chandler,But it's all so overwhelming.
13,Chandler,I don't know where to start.
14,Monica,"Hey, wait a second."
15,Monica,I can help you with this.
16,Monica,You just need to be organized.
17,Monica,"We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry."
18,Monica,There could be folders and files!
19,Chandler,Hey!
20,Chandler,This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!
21,Monica,I know!!!
22,Monica,My erection is back!
23,Joey,Thank you!
24,Phoebe,"Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?"
25,Joey,Okay.
26,Joey,Phoebe Thank you.
27,Joey,Thank you!
28,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash."
29,Joey,If you want I could loan you some money?
30,Phoebe,"Oh no, no, no."
31,Phoebe,I learned never to borrow money from friends.
32,Phoebe,"No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore."
33,Joey,"Oh, hey, how about this?"
34,Joey,Wanna be an extra on my show?
35,Phoebe,You could do that?
36,Joey,"Yeah, yeah."
37,Joey,The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.
38,Phoebe,"Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV!"
39,Joey,"Okay, now."
40,Joey,"I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think."
41,Phoebe,"Oh, really?"
42,Joey,No it is awesome!
43,Ross,Hi guys.
44,Phoebe,Wow!
45,Phoebe,"Hey, why are you all dressed up?"
46,Ross,Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone.
47,Ross,Doesn't she look cute?
48,Joey,She sure does.
49,Joey,Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?
50,Rachel,"Well, because if one more person says ""what a cute little boy"" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!"
51,Ross,"I think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh?"
52,Ross,She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts.
53,Ross,Can I get a blue bow?
54,Monica,"Okay, I have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision."
55,Chandler,How long was I in there?
56,Monica,Okay.
57,Monica,Let us start with the A's.
58,Monica,Advertising.
59,Chandler,Wait.
60,Chandler,Advertising!
61,Chandler,That's a great idea!
62,Monica,Don't you want to look through the rest?
63,Chandler,I don't think I have to hear the rest.
64,Chandler,Advertising makes perfect sense.
65,Chandler,"Sorry you had to waste all this time, though."
66,Monica,You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time?
67,Monica,"Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!"
68,Chandler,"I mean, I can write slogans."
69,Chandler,"I mean, how hard can it be, right?"
70,Chandler,"""Cheese."
71,Chandler,"It's milk that you chew."""
72,Chandler,"""Crackers."
73,Chandler,"Because your cheese needs a buddy."""
74,Chandler,"""A grape."
75,Chandler,"Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"""
76,Monica,I got one.
77,Monica,"""Socks."
78,Monica,"Because your family's feet deserve the best."""
79,Chandler,Honey?
80,Chandler,Leave it to the pros.
81,Monica,I actually know someone in advertising.
82,Monica,I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency.
83,Monica,Maybe I can get him to meet you?
84,Monica,Give me the phone.
85,Chandler,"""The phone."
86,Chandler,"Bringing you closer to people...who have phones."""
87,Monica,"""Marriage."
88,Monica,"It's not for everybody."""
89,Rachel,That went well.
90,Rachel,Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.
91,Ross,"Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread."
92,Rachel,I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff .
93,Rachel,Who the hell are you!
94,Rachel,I'm the hell person whose office this is!
95,Ross,"Good one, Rach."
96,Rachel,Excuse me?
97,Phoebe,"Joey, look at me!"
98,Phoebe,I'm a nurse!
99,Joey,Yes you are.
100,Joey,I think it may be time for my sponge bath.
101,Joey,"Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras."
102,Joey,"So, are you excited about your scene?"
103,Phoebe,Yeah!
104,Phoebe,But I'm a little shaky and nervous.
105,Joey,"Oh, relax."
106,Joey,Don't be.
107,Joey,"You'll be fine, you'll be fine."
108,Joey,They'll probably just make you stand in the back.
109,Phoebe,"Okay, now."
110,Phoebe,What?
111,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
112,Phoebe,I'm just a little nervous.
113,Phoebe,"Okay, that helps."
114,Joey,"Hey, you know what?"
115,Joey,"Don't worry, Pheebs!"
116,Joey,It usually takes me three takes too!
117,Joey,"Alright, eight."
118,Chandler,"No, no."
119,Chandler,But let me show you what I can do.
120,Chandler,"""Bagels and donuts."
121,Chandler,"Round food for every mood."""
122,Chandler,Really?
123,Chandler,That's great!
124,Chandler,It's funny.
125,Chandler,"When you said ""unpaid"" it sounded like you said ""unpaid."""
126,Chandler,"Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it."
127,Chandler,We're supposed to have sex tonight.
128,Chandler,"Actually, she's probably at home naked right now."
129,Chandler,I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me.
130,Chandler,I can just picture her on the bed right now.
131,Rachel,Wait a minute!
132,Rachel,"What do you mean, you're taking over my job?"
133,Rachel,A vacation?
134,Rachel,My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.
135,Rachel,Alright!
136,Rachel,"Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks!"
137,Rachel,And I want everything back to the way it was.
138,Rachel,I can't say that I care too much for the way you've rearranged my office.
139,Rachel,Excuse me?
140,Ross,Rach we have a code brown situation.
141,Rachel,"Can you please, please take care of it for me?"
142,Ross,"Alright, but you have to do one sometime."
143,Rachel,Let me just get this straight!
144,Rachel,So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?
145,Rachel,That's right.
146,Rachel,You're very cheeky for a temp.
147,Rachel,"Oh yeah, what department was that?"
148,Rachel,The Jerk department?
149,Rachel,Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue?
150,Rachel,Mr.
151,Rachel,"Oh, hi Mr. Zelner."
152,Rachel,Mr.
153,Rachel,That's great.
154,Rachel,"So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to?"
155,Rachel,"Oh, wow."
156,Rachel,Super ass-kissing power.
157,Rachel,Mr.
158,Rachel,Today.
159,Rachel,"No, I said today!"
160,Rachel,"See, for a superhero, not so much with the listening."
161,Joey,Hey.
162,Phoebe,Hey.
163,Phoebe,"So, what did he say?"
164,Joey,"Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I'm gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word ""puppy."""
165,Joey,"Okay, so he"
166,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, I can't do this."
167,Phoebe,I'm not an actor.
168,Joey,"That's right, you're not."
169,Joey,You're a nurse.
170,Joey,You're Nurse With Tray.
171,Phoebe,Joey.
172,Joey,"No, no."
173,Joey,"Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends."
174,Joey,"She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!"
175,Phoebe,Who dies?
176,Joey,Man With Eye Patch!
177,Joey,You get in there and you do your job.
178,Phoebe,"Yes, doctor."
179,Joey,Okay.
180,Phoebe,"Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming!"
181,Phoebe,"Yes, I did it!!!"
182,Phoebe,I nailed it!!!
183,Phoebe,Yay!
184,Phoebe,What's next?
185,Phoebe,"Okay, from the top, people!"
186,Rachel,Listen.
187,Rachel,Sudden change of plans.
188,Rachel,My maternity leave just ended.
189,Rachel,"They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me."
190,Ross,What?
191,Ross,"No, that's illegal."
192,Ross,I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even...
193,Rachel,"Alright, alright."
194,Rachel,Calm down Norma Rae.
195,Rachel,They didn't actually say that.
196,Rachel,I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out.
197,Ross,What about Emma?
198,Ross,We don't have a nanny.
199,Rachel,I know.
200,Rachel,"You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight."
201,Rachel,Can you please just take care of her for today?
202,Ross,Absolutely.
203,Ross,Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.
204,Rachel,"Come on, I don't know what else to do."
205,Ross,"Fine, fine."
206,Ross,"We'll have fun, won't we?"
207,Ross,"Yes, we will, yes we will."
208,Rachel,Ross?
209,Ross,Huh?
210,Rachel,You're pretty.
211,Chandler,"Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch."
212,Chandler,It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it.
213,Chandler,Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.
214,Ross,So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?
215,Chandler,Yeah.
216,Ross,Good-bye.
217,Monica,"Okay, it's baby time."
218,Monica,Pants off Bing.
219,Monica,Didn't see you there Geller.
220,Chandler,"Yeah, Ross is here so..."
221,Ross,"Yeah, and I was really hoping that I could hang out."
222,Ross,What do you feel like doing?
223,Monica,We're gonna have sex.
224,Ross,I don't feel like having sex.
225,Ross,Maybe we can watch a movie or something.
226,Monica,Let me put it this way.
227,Monica,We're having sex whether you're here or not.
228,Ross,Pants off Bing!
229,Rachel,Alright.
230,Rachel,"Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?"
231,Rachel,"Hey, they were popular when I left!"
232,Rachel,"Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?"
233,Rachel,"Oh, no no no no."
234,Rachel,"I see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy."
235,Rachel,"Okay, I've had it for five years, and I know how it works, so why don't you just catch me up!"
236,Rachel,Oh god.
237,Rachel,You've totally messed with the back support of my chair.
238,Rachel,How do you fix this?
239,Rachel,"Fine, I will."
240,Rachel,"Alright, fill me in!"
241,Ross,Hey.
242,Chandler,Hey.
243,Ross,You have a blue tie that would go with this?
244,Ross,Emma spit up on mine.
245,Chandler,"Oh, yeah."
246,Chandler,But you have to give it back if I get a job.
247,Chandler,"Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits."
248,Monica,"Hi, good morning lover."
249,Monica,"I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees."
250,Ross,Here's an idea.
251,Ross,You walk into a room...take a quick scan!
252,Monica,Sorry.
253,Monica,But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.
254,Chandler,"Oh god, I have to tell you something."
255,Chandler,You're not pregnant.
256,Monica,What are you talking about?
257,Chandler,That thing that I have to do to make a baby.
258,Chandler,I faked it.
259,Monica,What!?
260,Monica,You faked it?
261,Ross,You know what?
262,Ross,I don't need a tie.
263,Ross,"I mean, it's better, open collar."
264,Ross,"You know, it's more casual"
265,Phoebe,"Joey, listen."
266,Phoebe,"I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense."
267,Phoebe,"Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?"
268,Joey,"Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts."
269,Joey,It's okay.
270,Phoebe,"Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse."
271,Phoebe,And now suddenly I'm the waitress?
272,Phoebe,That's gonna confuse my fans.
273,Joey,"Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress."
274,Phoebe,Uhuh.
275,Phoebe,"Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children."
276,Joey,Nice.
277,Phoebe,Wait a minute.
278,Phoebe,Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital.
279,Phoebe,Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?
280,Joey,"No, no."
281,Joey,"See, you and Drake are having a fight."
282,Phoebe,About what?
283,Joey,He slept with you and then never called you.
284,Phoebe,And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.
285,Phoebe,"Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back."
286,Joey,"Oh, calm down!"
287,Joey,She means on the show!
288,Joey,We need some new extras around here!
289,Rachel,Yes.
290,Rachel,Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation.
291,Rachel,"I actually made a few changes, but I think I'm caught up on everything."
292,Rachel,So ask me anything!
293,Rachel,Except that!
294,Rachel,"Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner."
295,Rachel,We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon.
296,Rachel,Mr.
297,Rachel,What?
298,Rachel,I can't do that!
299,Rachel,"I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour."
300,Rachel,Mr.
301,Rachel,"Well, there you go."
302,Rachel,"You win, you win."
303,Rachel,"You get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy his helicopter, and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him!"
304,Rachel,"No, I can't, I have a baby."
305,Rachel,Why would you do that?
306,Rachel,That's really nice.
307,Rachel,Then you're not gonna like what's coming.
308,Rachel,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
309,Rachel,"Thank you, thank you."
310,Joey,Please don't fire my friend.
311,Joey,Just let me talk to her.
312,Joey,"Thank you, thank you."
313,Joey,How about I do something for you?
314,Joey,"Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?"
315,Joey,"Hey, listen Pheebs."
316,Joey,"I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?"
317,Phoebe,I can't do that.
318,Phoebe,I'm an actor.
319,Phoebe,I have a process.
320,Joey,You're a masseuse.
321,Joey,You have a table with a hole in it.
322,Phoebe,"Wait a minute, I see what's happening here."
323,Phoebe,You're threatened.
324,Joey,What?
325,Phoebe,"Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you."
326,Phoebe,"Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar."
327,Phoebe,Come join me up here!
328,Joey,"Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy."
329,Monica,You faked it?
330,Monica,You couldn't have faked it!
331,Chandler,Oh yes you can.
332,Chandler,You just make the faces and the noises.
333,Monica,Guys can fake it?
334,Monica,Unbelievable.
335,Monica,The one thing that's ours!
336,Monica,"Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?"
337,Chandler,That's actually why.
338,Chandler,"Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby, I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while."
339,Monica,Like a month?
340,Chandler,Or a year?
341,Monica,"Really, you want to wait a year?"
342,Chandler,It could be less than a year.
343,Chandler,"I mean, you've heard my stuff."
344,Chandler,"""Pants."
345,Chandler,"Like shorts, but longer."""
346,Chandler,It'll probably be more than a year.
347,Monica,I really wanna have a baby.
348,Chandler,"Yeah, me too."
349,Chandler,"Look, I'll just get my old job back."
350,Monica,"No, I want you to have a job that you love."
351,Monica,Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.
352,Chandler,I quit and you learn what I do?
353,Monica,"It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby."
354,Monica,"I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy."
355,Monica,"There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons."
356,Chandler,I guess.
357,Chandler,It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.
358,Monica,It's gonna be really scary.
359,Monica,"I mean, god."
360,Monica,"When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control."
361,Monica,"I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it."
362,Monica,What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer?
363,Monica,Messes up all the ribbons?!
364,Monica,"What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!?"
365,Monica,Where will all the ribbons go!?
366,Chandler,Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?
367,Monica,"Yes, please!"
368,Chandler,"Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time."
369,Monica,I wish I could say the same.
370,Monica,I'm a little shook up!
0,Ross,"Man, I sure miss Julie."
1,Chandler,Spanish midgets.
2,Chandler,Spanish midgets wrestling.
3,Chandler,Julie.
4,Chandler,"Ok, yes, I see how you got there."
5,Ross,You ever figure out what that thing's for?
6,Chandler,"No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing."
7,Chandler,"You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life."
8,Chandler,"My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned."
9,Chandler,What?
10,Chandler,Bob here.
11,Chandler,What've you been up to?
12,Chandler,Can you hold on a moment?
13,Chandler,I have another call.
14,Chandler,I love her.
15,Ross,I know.
16,Chandler,I'm back.
17,Chandler,"Um, absolutely."
18,Chandler,"Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon?"
19,Chandler,"Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?"
20,Chandler,Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
21,Ross,"Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, ""hey, you're not Bob."""
22,Chandler,"I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table."
23,Ross,Oh my god.
24,Ross,You are pure evil.
25,Chandler,"Ok, pure evil, horny and alone."
26,Chandler,I've done this.
27,Ross,"Yeah, yeah, everybody's here."
28,Ross,"Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico."
29,Rachel,"Hi, Julie."
30,Chandler,"Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday."
31,Phoebe,"Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up?"
32,Phoebe,"You know, like from, like 20?"
33,Chandler,"Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake."
34,Joey,Do we need a cake?
35,Chandler,"Look guys, I know it's a little steep."
36,Rachel,"Yeah, whoosh!"
37,Chandler,But it's Ross.
38,Phoebe,It's Ross.
39,Joey,All right.
40,Chandler,"I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing."
41,Ross,"Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight."
42,Ross,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?"
43,Chandler,"You know, I think I might just."
44,Rachel,"So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?"
45,Joey,"Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies."
46,Phoebe,Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
47,Rachel,"Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?"
48,Joey,Yes!
49,Joey,"Yeah, it's like they're always saying ""let's go here, let's go there""."
50,Joey,Like we can afford to go here and there.
51,Phoebe,"Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know?"
52,Phoebe,"God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross."
53,Joey,For Ross.
54,Rachel,"For Ross, Ross, Ross."
55,Monica,Oh my god.
56,Rachel,Hey.
57,Joey,Hi.
58,Rachel,What?
59,Monica,"I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti."
60,Monica,"All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office."
61,Monica,"It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job."
62,Joey,"If it's not you, this is a horrible story."
63,Monica,"Fortunately, it is me."
64,Monica,"And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much."
65,Monica,"Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate."
66,Monica,"You know, someplace nice."
67,Joey,"Yeah, someplace nice."
68,Joey,How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
69,Ross,I'm tellin' you.
70,Ross,You can't do this.
71,Chandler,"Oh, come on."
72,Chandler,I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
73,Ross,That doesn't matter.
74,Ross,She wanted to call Bob.
75,Ross,"Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with."
76,Ross,You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.
77,Chandler,"We don't know Bob, ok?"
78,Chandler,We know me.
79,Chandler,We like me.
80,Chandler,Please let me be happy.
81,Ross,Go over there and tell that woman the truth.
82,Chandler,All right.
83,Ross,Go.
84,Chandler,Hi.
85,Chandler,"Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something."
86,Chandler,Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
87,Chandler,I don't know.
88,Chandler,I just had this weird sense.
89,Chandler,"You know, but that's me."
90,Chandler,I'm weird and sensitive.
91,Chandler,Tissue?
92,Chandler,"No, you keep the pack."
93,Chandler,I'm all cried out today.
94,Ross,"Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--"
95,Monica,Who is also in charge of purchasing.
96,Ross,Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--
97,Monica,Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
98,Ross,"Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there."
99,Ross,Here's to my little sister--
100,Monica,"Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!"
101,Joey,Cool.
102,Phoebe,Let's see!
103,Ross,"That's fine, I'll just wait!"
104,Monica,"Oh, sorry."
105,Joey,"Sorry, sorry."
106,Ross,Monica!
107,Rachel,"Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet."
108,Phoebe,"Wow, look at these prices."
109,Rachel,"Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching."
110,Joey,"What are these, like famous chickens?"
111,Chandler,"Hey, sorry I'm late."
112,Chandler,"Congratulations, Mon."
113,Chandler,I'm not sorry I'm late.
114,Chandler,How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
115,Ross,"Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine."
116,Ross,"Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?"
117,Chandler,"Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number."
118,Ross,"Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?"
119,Monica,"Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns."
120,Ross,That sounds great.
121,Ross,Same for me.
122,Joey,"Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza."
123,Joey,"But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?"
124,Rachel,"Ok, I will have the uh,  side salad."
125,Rachel,"Uh, I don't know."
126,Rachel,Why don't you put it right here next to my water?
127,Phoebe,"Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care."
128,Chandler,"I will have the uh, Cajun catfish."
129,Chandler,"Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly."
130,Chandler,"You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?"
131,Ross,"Plus tip, divided by six."
132,Ross,"Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks."
133,Rachel,"Um, everyone?"
134,Ross,"Oh, you're right, I'm sorry."
135,Joey,Thank you.
136,Ross,"Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay."
137,Monica,"Oh, thank you!"
138,Ross,"So five of us is, $33.50 apiece."
139,Phoebe,"No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen."
140,Chandler,"Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback."
141,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks?"
142,Phoebe,No!
143,Phoebe,"Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza!"
144,Phoebe,It's just...
145,Ross,"Ok, Pheebs!"
146,Ross,How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had.
147,Ross,It's no big deal.
148,Phoebe,Not for you.
149,Monica,"All right, what's goin' on?"
150,Rachel,"Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now."
151,Rachel,I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.
152,Phoebe,Fine.
153,Phoebe,"All right, fine."
154,Joey,Yeah.
155,Chandler,You can tell us.
156,Ross,"Hello, it's us, all right?"
157,Ross,It'll be fine.
158,Joey,"Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you."
159,Monica,Ok.
160,Ross,I hear ya.
161,Chandler,We can talk about that.
162,Phoebe,"Well, then...Let's."
163,Ross,"I, I just never think of money as an issue."
164,Rachel,That's 'cause you have it.
165,Ross,That's a good point.
166,Chandler,"So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?"
167,Joey,"'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla."
168,Ross,Wha--?
169,Ross,"Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?"
170,Rachel,"Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing."
171,Monica,"If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift."
172,Ross,G-gift?
173,Ross,The thing's not the gift?
174,Chandler,"No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish."
175,Ross,Hootie and the--oh my.
176,Ross,"I, I can catch them on the radio."
177,Phoebe,"No, now I feel bad."
178,Phoebe,You wanna go to the concert.
179,Ross,"No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together."
180,Monica,All of us.
181,Chandler,Together.
182,Ross,Not at the concert.
183,Rachel,Ok.
184,Joey,Yeah.
185,Rachel,Thank you.
186,Joey,Thanks.
187,Phoebe,Yeah.
188,Chandler,"So, the ebola virus."
189,Chandler,"That's gotta suck, huh?"
190,Chandler,"Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?"
191,Monica,"I don't know, Chandler."
192,Monica,Let's take a look.
193,Phoebe,"Oh, it's like a skit."
194,Monica,"Why, it's dinner for six."
195,Monica,"5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe."
196,Ross,Whoo!
197,Phoebe,Cool.
198,Monica,"Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you."
199,Ross,"But wait, there's more."
200,Ross,"Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?"
201,Chandler,"By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall."
202,Ross,Come on.
203,Chandler,"Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish!"
204,Chandler,The Blowfish!
205,Monica,"It's on us, all right, so don't worry."
206,Monica,It's our treat.
207,Phoebe,So...Thank you.
208,Ross,Could you be less enthused?
209,Joey,"Look, it's a nice gesture, it is."
210,Joey,But it just feels like--
211,Monica,Like?
212,Joey,Charity.
213,Monica,Charity?
214,Ross,We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
215,Rachel,"Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big."
216,Phoebe,"Actually, it makes us feel that big."
217,Ross,"I don't, I don't understand."
218,Ross,"I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys."
219,Chandler,"If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault."
220,Chandler,Maybe that's just how you feel.
221,Joey,"Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel."
222,Rachel,"Ok, we never shoulda talked about this."
223,Phoebe,"I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now."
224,Rachel,Me neither.
225,Joey,Me too.
226,Monica,"Guys, we bought the tickets."
227,Phoebe,"Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff."
228,Chandler,Why did you look at me when you said that?
229,Monica,"Well, I guess now we can't go."
230,Rachel,What?
231,Rachel,"Come on, you do what you want to do."
232,Rachel,Do we always have to do everything together?
233,Monica,You know what?
234,Monica,You're right.
235,Phoebe,Fine.
236,Ross,Fine.
237,Joey,Fine.
238,Chandler,Fine.
239,Rachel,Fine.
240,Monica,All right.
241,Monica,We're gonna go.
242,Monica,It's not for another six hours.
243,Monica,We're gonna go then.
244,Ross,Chandler!
245,Chandler,Yeah?
246,Ross,Geez!
247,Ross,Are you ready?
248,Chandler,Yeah.
249,Chandler,Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
250,Ross,Whoa!
251,Ross,You had sex today?
252,Chandler,"Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it."
253,Chandler,"I was awesome, ok?"
254,Chandler,She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
255,Ross,Wow.
256,Chandler,"Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign."
257,Ross,Still doing the screening thing?
258,Chandler,I had sex today.
259,Chandler,I never have to answer that phone again.
260,Chandler,Bob here.
261,Chandler,"So, uh, you met someone, huh?"
262,Chandler,"So, uh, how was he?"
263,Chandler,Eh?
264,Chandler,"Well, that makes me feel so good."
265,Ross,Bumpy?
266,Chandler,"Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with."
267,Chandler,And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
268,Monica,You know what?
269,Monica,I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
270,Ross,"Yeah, I know, it's my birthday."
271,Ross,We all should be here.
272,Chandler,"So, let's go."
273,Ross,"Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song."
274,Chandler,"Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now."
275,Monica,"You know, the guys are probably having a great time."
276,Joey,"Come on you guys, one more time."
277,Phoebe,Ok. One.
278,Joey,Nooo.
279,Monica,That was amazing!
280,Ross,"Excellent, that was excellent."
281,Chandler,I can't believe the guys missed this.
282,Ross,What guys?
283,Ross,"Oh, yeah."
284,Monica,Do I know you?
285,Monica,"Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher?"
286,Monica,How've you been?
287,Monica,You can't be a lawyer.
288,Monica,You're eight.
289,Monica,"Uh, wait, backstage?"
290,Ross,Ross.
291,Chandler,Chandler.
292,Ross,"Hey, you guys."
293,Rachel,Happy birthday.
294,Ross,"Oh, thank you, thanks."
295,Ross,"So uh, how was your night last night?"
296,Rachel,"Oh, well, it pretty much sucked."
297,Rachel,How was yours?
298,Monica,"Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher."
299,Monica,Remember him?
300,Rachel,Oh yeah.
301,Rachel,I used to babysit him.
302,Rachel,"Hey, how's his dad?"
303,Monica,"Uh, good."
304,Ross,"Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust."
305,Chandler,"Yeah, we really missed you guys."
306,Joey,"Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid."
307,Phoebe,"We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?"
308,Monica,"No, I just, I fell down."
309,Rachel,On someone's lips?
310,Rachel,Where'd you get the hickey?
311,Monica,"You know, a party, or--"
312,Rachel,What party?
313,Ross,"It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band."
314,Joey,You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
315,Chandler,"Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this."
316,Rachel,Who gave you that hickey?
317,Monica,That would be the work of a Blowfish.
318,Rachel,Oh!
319,Phoebe,Oh!
320,Phoebe,I can't believe it.
321,Phoebe,I can't believe this.
322,Phoebe,"We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, ""hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck""."
323,Ross,"Look, don't blame us."
324,Ross,"You guys coulda been there, you know."
325,Rachel,"What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?"
326,Monica,It's work.
327,Chandler,I don't know what to say.
328,Chandler,I'm sorry that we make more money than you.
329,Chandler,But we're not gonna feel guilty about it.
330,Chandler,We work really hard for it.
331,Joey,And we don't work hard?
332,Monica,"Yeah, hi, it's Monica."
333,Monica,I just got a page.
334,Chandler,I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
335,Joey,And you feel like we hold you back.
336,Chandler,Yes.
337,Rachel,Oh!
338,Chandler,No.
339,Monica,"Leon, Leon."
340,Monica,Shhh!
341,Monica,Guys.
342,Monica,"Wait, I don't understand."
343,Monica,Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor.
344,Monica,That was not a kick back.
345,Monica,I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing.
346,Monica,What corporate policy?
347,Monica,No.
348,Monica,Yeah.
349,Monica,All right.
350,Monica,I just got fired.
351,Phoebe,Oh.
352,Joey,Let me get that.
353,Joey,You got five bucks?
0,Chandler,Buh-bye.
1,Chandler,I just got us reservations at Michelle's and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
2,Monica,Betrothed
3,Chandler,betrothed couple.
4,Phoebe,Hey!
5,Chandler,Hey!
6,Chandler,Rachel and
7,Monica,Hi!
8,Phoebe,Haaaa...  ... ahhhh!
9,Chandler,Pheebs?
10,Phoebe,Huh?
11,Chandler,Skull?
12,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah, it's my mom's."
13,Rachel,Oh my god!
14,Phoebe,"No, no, no."
15,Phoebe,It's not!
16,Phoebe,It's not my mom.
17,Phoebe,It belonged to mom.
18,Phoebe,"Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die."
19,Phoebe,"And, you can put candy in it."
20,Ross,Hey!
21,Monica,Licorice?
22,Ross,Sure!
23,Ross,"Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year."
24,Monica,Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
25,Ross,Nope.
26,Ross,"I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah."
27,Phoebe,And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
28,Rachel,You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
29,Ross,Hmm.
30,Joey,Hey.
31,Rachel,Did you know he was in there?
32,Monica,No.
33,Chandler,How long have we been home?
34,Monica,About a half an hour.
35,Chandler,Lovely!
36,Chandler,Opening Credits
37,Chandler,"Hey, you know what I was thinking?"
38,Chandler,"When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?"
39,Monica,No.
40,Chandler,Why not?
41,Monica,Bing's weird.
42,Phoebe,"Oh, hey, you guys!"
43,Chandler,Hey!
44,Monica,Hey!
45,Phoebe,Hey.
46,Phoebe,Guess what!
47,Phoebe,"My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out."
48,Monica,"Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!"
49,Phoebe,"Yes, you will be very sad."
50,Phoebe,"All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news."
51,Chandler,Ohh!
52,Chandler,You guys gonna be living together again?
53,Phoebe,"Yeah, why not?"
54,Chandler,"Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him."
55,Phoebe,"Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?"
56,Chandler,"No reason, exceptshetoldme."
57,Phoebe,Really?
58,Phoebe,"So she said, she didn't wanna live with me anymore?"
59,Chandler,No!
60,Chandler,"No, she didn't say that."
61,Chandler,I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
62,Monica,"Phoebe, don't worry about it."
63,Monica,I'm sure she wants to live with you.
64,Phoebe,You're sure?
65,Phoebe,You're absolutely sure?
66,Monica,"Well, no."
67,Monica,"But, um, I bet she probably does."
68,Phoebe,Probably?
69,Phoebe,"Yeah, I don't like that word."
70,Phoebe,Kind of what probably' really means.
71,Phoebe,"Yeah, uh-huh."
72,Phoebe,"Yeah, oh, ""Your mom probably won't kill herself,"" y'know?"
73,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on ""Probably!"""
74,Phoebe,Y'know?
75,Phoebe,You gotta take care of yourselves!
76,Phoebe,In this world history teaches us nothing!
77,Chandler,"Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?"
78,Rachel,Hey!
79,Joey,Hey!
80,Joey,"Great, you're home!"
81,Joey,Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!
82,Rachel,Drums?
83,Joey,No!
84,Joey,Drums!
85,Chandler,"Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?"
86,Monica,I'm sorry.
87,Monica,"But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it."
88,Monica,"Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing."
89,Monica,Maitre d'
90,Chandler,Forty-five minutes?
91,Chandler,We have tickets to the Musicman at
92,Chandler,Is this because of the burrito thing?
93,Monica,You need to give him money.
94,Chandler,Give him money?
95,Chandler,It was a joke!
96,Monica,"No, to get a table!"
97,Monica,Places like are always shakin' you down.
98,Monica,Everybody wants to be paid off.
99,Chandler,"Right, calm down, O'Mally."
100,Chandler,I'll slip him some money.
101,Monica,You've got to be smooth about it.
102,Chandler,"Hey, I can be smooth."
103,Chandler,"Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it."
104,Chandler,Maitre d'
105,Chandler,Okay.
106,Monica,How did it go?
107,Chandler,Had the money in the wrong hand.
108,Ross,"Wooooooo, hehehe."
109,Ross,"Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do ya?"
110,Ross,"Well, I do, so let's..."
111,Ross,"So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?"
112,Ross,"Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?"
113,Ross,"Yes, but also  Hanukkah!"
114,Ross,"See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday."
115,Ross,"Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle."
116,Ross,"See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees."
117,Ross,"Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh  Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay."
118,Ross,"Okay, it's not a contest."
119,Ross,"Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?"
120,Ross,No!
121,Ross,"Oh, no-no-no."
122,Ross,"Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben."
123,Ross,"No, hey-hey, come on,  Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay?"
124,Ross,"Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!"
125,Ross,Yes!
126,Ross,Santa's coming!
127,Monica,It's easy!
128,Monica,Just keep it casual!
129,Monica,"Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!"
130,Chandler,How do you know so much about this?
131,Monica,I don't know.
132,Chandler,"Richard used to do it, didn't he?"
133,Monica,We'd be eating our soup right now.
134,Chandler,Mustached bastard
135,Monica,"Okay, those people just left, come on!"
136,Monica,Quick!
137,Monica,Give him the money and get their table!
138,Chandler,Excuse me...
139,Chandler,Male
140,Chandler,Ahh-hahaha!
141,Rachel,Ha!
142,Phoebe,So you like the drums!
143,Phoebe,"That's, that's great!"
144,Phoebe,"Y'know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation."
145,Phoebe,"All right, okay, well, apparently not!"
146,Phoebe,"So, yay!"
147,Joey,"Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song."
148,Joey,Ready?
149,Joey,"One, two, three, four...   Rachel and"
150,Joey,Tequila!
151,Phoebe,That's fun.
152,Phoebe,Commercial Break
153,Chandler,"Thank you Gunther, put it there."
154,Chandler,Definitely not easier with coins.
155,Chandler,Thank you.
156,Joey,Thank you.
157,Joey,Hey Pheebs!
158,Phoebe,Hey!
159,Joey,Here.
160,Joey,Now I only owe you $49.50.
161,Chandler,Hey Pheebs!
162,Phoebe,Hey!
163,Chandler,"If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?"
164,Monica,It's not just the drum noise.
165,Monica,"Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, ""Oh my eye!"
166,Monica,"Oh god, my eye!"""
167,Monica,"I mean, it is so annoying."
168,Phoebe,"Yes, thank you."
169,Phoebe,"You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums."
170,Monica,"Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?"
171,Phoebe,Maybe on some level.
172,Rachel,"Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air."
173,Joey,What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
174,Phoebe,"Hey, Joey, I got you another present."
175,Joey,"Oh wait, before you tell me what it is!"
176,Joey,"Okay, what is it?"
177,Phoebe,It's atarantula!
178,Phoebe,Oh!
179,Phoebe,God!
180,Phoebe,"Rachel, look, I'm sorry."
181,Phoebe,"What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?"
182,Rachel,What are you talking about?
183,Rachel,I love them!
184,Rachel,"Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid."
185,Rachel,"But it-it died, because my cat ate it."
186,Rachel,"And then, then my cat died."
187,Rachel,"But Joey, isn't this cool?"
188,Joey,Is it on me?
189,Joey,"I feel, I feel like it's on me!"
190,Joey,"I got, hey!"
191,Rachel,"Oh, isn't that adorable?"
192,Rachel,Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
193,Phoebe,"Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here."
194,Rachel,What?
195,Rachel,"Wait-wait a minute, what?"
196,Rachel,"Phoebe, what's the matter?"
197,Phoebe,Our apartment is ready.
198,Rachel,And that makes you angry because
199,Phoebe,Because you would rather live here with Joey.
200,Rachel,Where did you get that?
201,Phoebe,Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here.
202,Phoebe,And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
203,Rachel,Phoebe?
204,Phoebe,Hm?
205,Rachel,Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment?
206,Rachel,"Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!"
207,Phoebe,Fish!
208,Rachel,"It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal."
209,Phoebe,"Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here"
210,Rachel,"Oh, it's so much more fun with you."
211,Phoebe,"We did have fun, didn't we?"
212,Rachel,We did!
213,Phoebe,"Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight."
214,Rachel,"Oh, I would love to!"
215,Phoebe,"Yay, okay!"
216,Rachel,"Good, good, good, good, good."
217,Phoebe,"Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop."
218,Rachel,Um...
219,Rachel,Done!
220,Ross,Hey!
221,Ross,"No, these are my pants."
222,Ross,"Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?"
223,Ross,"Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy?"
224,Ross,"I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, Iuh, you gotta have something."
225,Ross,I'm the holiday armadillo!
226,Ross,I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you  a Merry Christmas!
227,Monica,"What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?"
228,Ross,Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
229,Monica,"Wow, come in, have a seat."
230,Monica,You must be exhausted coming all the way fromTexas.
231,Ross,"That's right, Ben."
232,Ross,I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states.
233,Ross,And Mexico!
234,Ross,"But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben."
235,Ross,Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.
236,Ross,"You're welcome, Ben."
237,Ross,"Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!"
238,Ross,You are?
239,Ross,"Me, too!"
240,Monica,Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
241,Ross,You wanna wander in the hall?
242,Ross,"Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?"
243,Ross,Yeah!
244,Monica,Come on Ben.
245,Ross,Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
246,Chandler,"Ho, ho, ho!"
247,Chandler,Merry Christmas!
248,Chandler,Hey!
249,Ross,"What are you doing here, Santa?"
250,Chandler,"Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben."
251,Chandler,"What are you doing here, weirdturtle-man?"
252,Ross,"I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend."
253,Ross,You sent me here to give Ben some presents.
254,Ross,Remember?
255,Chandler,What?
256,Chandler,"You bet I did, Ben, put it there!"
257,Chandler,"Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small!"
258,Chandler,"Ho, ho, ho!"
259,Monica,"Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen?"
260,Monica,"There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say."
261,Ross,What are you doing?
262,Chandler,"You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!"
263,Ross,"Thank you, but, but you gotta leave."
264,Chandler,Why?
265,Ross,"Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it."
266,Chandler,But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
267,Ross,"I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me."
268,Chandler,"Fine, I'll give the suit back."
269,Monica,"Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?"
270,Chandler,Santa?
271,Chandler,Really?
272,Monica,"Yes, is that okay?"
273,Chandler,Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
274,Monica,No.
275,Chandler,Then it's okay!
276,Ross,"Okay Ben, Santa has to go."
277,Ross,Say good-bye!
278,Chandler,"Because, if Santa and the HolidayArmadillo?"
279,Chandler,...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode.
280,Chandler,Merry Christmas!
281,Ross,"Fine, I-I give up."
282,Ross,"Santa, Santa can stay."
283,Chandler,"Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah."
284,Chandler,"Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?"
285,Ross,"All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah."
286,Ross,"Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees."
287,Joey,Merry Christmas!
288,Rachel,Oh wow!
289,Rachel,Look at this place!
290,Phoebe,"Oh, this is terrible."
291,Phoebe,"Oh, they've made so many changes I can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymoreOoh!"
292,Phoebe,New sconces!
293,Rachel,Oh my God!
294,Phoebe,What?
295,Rachel,"Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?"
296,Phoebe,Yeah?
297,Rachel,And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
298,Phoebe,Yeah?
299,Rachel,Do you really not know where I'm going with this?
300,Rachel,It left!
301,Rachel,It's one huge room!
302,Phoebe,Oh no!
303,Phoebe,Oh!
304,Phoebe,Wow!!
305,Rachel,See?
306,Phoebe,"Well, I guess we'll just have to put the wall back up."
307,Rachel,"You can't, because of the new skylight!"
308,Phoebe,There's a skylight?!
309,Phoebe,Wow!
310,Rachel,So what should we do?
311,Rachel,Should we start looking for a new place?
312,Phoebe,"Y'know I'm-I'm sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that."
313,Rachel,Oh yeah?
314,Rachel,Startin' to feel her again there are we?
315,Phoebe,"A little bit, yeah."
316,Rachel,Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
317,Phoebe,You heard her too?!
318,Phoebe,You have the gift!
319,Rachel,"Phoebe, it's okay."
320,Rachel,I like living with Joey.
321,Phoebe,Are you sure?
322,Rachel,"Oh please, I hate packing, it's closer to work, and we do have fun."
323,Rachel,"Although, I'm really gonna miss living with you."
324,Phoebe,Oh me too.
325,Rachel,I know.
326,Rachel,"Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that?"
327,Rachel,"Listen, I'm gettin' something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?"
328,Phoebe,"No, I do not hear that."
329,Ross,"and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should've just lasted just one day, burned for"
330,Ross,"That's right, and that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today."
331,Ross,The end.
332,Ross,Yeah?
333,Chandler,My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.
334,Ross,The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part!
335,Ross,"Okay Ben, it's time to light the Hanukkah candles!"
336,Rachel,Hey!
337,Phoebe,Oh.
338,Rachel,Wow!
339,Rachel,It looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.
340,Ross,"Come on, come on, we're-we're-we're lighting the candles!"
341,Rachel,Oh.
342,Phoebe,Oh.
343,Phoebe,"Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral?"
344,Phoebe,Ending Credits

183,Rachel,Uh.
184,Rachel,Did you call your parents?
185,Ross,"Oh, yeah."
186,Ross,Emma's doing great.

193,Ross,"Yeah, sure, right!"
194,Ross,Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room.

196,Ross,Sorry.
197,Ross,You ok?
198,Rachel,Yeah.
199,Ross,"You had a rough day, uh?"
200,Rachel,"Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know?"
201,Rachel,"I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick!"
202,Ross,But we do!
203,Ross,"It's gonna be ok, Rach!"
204,Rachel,Ow.
205,Rachel,I don't want him to wake up alone!
206,Rachel,I should go to the hospital!
207,Ross,What?
208,Ross,"No, no!"
209,Ross,"Hey, hey, hey look..."
210,Rachel,What?
211,Ross,"They gave him a lot of medication, ok?"
212,Ross,He wouldn't even know if you were there.
213,Ross,"Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?"
214,Rachel,"Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?"
215,Ross,"No, God!"
216,Ross,"Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok?"
217,Ross,Right now you just need to get some rest.
218,Rachel,"Ok, maybe you're right."
219,Ross,Good night.
220,Rachel,"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
221,Rachel,Would you stay here with me for a little while?
222,Ross,Sure!
223,Rachel,Ok.
224,Rachel,Thank you for coming with me today.
225,Ross,"Oh, of course..."
226,Rachel,Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room!
227,Ross,Me too.
228,Ross,Come here.
229,Rachel,I just don't want to be alone tonight.
230,Ross,"Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or... Oh, oh."
231,Ross,"No, Rach!"
232,Ross,"I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea."
233,Rachel,"Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?"
234,Ross,"No, look, uh."
235,Ross,"You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you."
236,Rachel,Taking advantage?
237,Rachel,"I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!"
238,Ross,"Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!"
239,Rachel,Wow.
240,Rachel,Ok.
241,Ross,I'll see you in the morning .
242,Rachel,Mhm-mh!
243,Ross,"Haven't had sex in four months, I should get a medal for that!"
244,Monica,"Oh, I'm glad."
245,Monica,"Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though."
246,Monica,I just did not see this coming.
247,Chandler,New York is awesome!
248,Monica,What is with you?
249,Chandler,"Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know."
250,Monica,"Yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo-ing."
251,Monica,Oh!
252,Monica,It was our pleasure.
253,Monica,We are so much enjoying getting to know you.
254,Chandler,"Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?"
255,Chandler,That's great.
256,Monica,How's that now?
257,Chandler,"So, what does the other guy do?"
258,Chandler,Does he go to college too?
259,Monica,Was he falsely accused of something?
260,Chandler,I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
261,Monica,Are you awake?
262,Chandler,Of course I'm awake.
263,Chandler,Assume from now on that I'm always awake!
264,Monica,"Alright, we don't know that it's him."
265,Monica,"I mean, it could be the football guy."
266,Chandler,"Honey, it's us."
267,Chandler,Of course it's the shovel-killer.
268,Monica,"Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby?"
269,Monica,No!
270,Monica,Would we treat him any differently?
271,Chandler,I'd keep an eye on him!
272,Chandler,We have to find out which one the father is.
273,Monica,How?
274,Chandler,"I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?"
275,Monica,"Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting."
276,Chandler,"Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer."
277,Chandler,He probably loves him mommy.
278,Chandler,"He's probably got a tattoo that says ""mom"" on his shovel-wielding arm!"
279,Joey,"Huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk!"
280,Joey,Thank you.
281,Phoebe,Hey Joey.
282,Joey,Hey!
283,Phoebe,"Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient."
284,Phoebe,SO lets try it again.
285,Joey,"Oh, no, that's okay, I don't need your help."
286,Joey,"I worked on it myself and I gotta say, I am pretty good!"
287,Phoebe,"Really, can I hear some of it."
288,Joey,"Sure, sure."
289,Joey,"Ok,  ""Bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu""  See?"
290,Phoebe,"Well, you're not,  You're not... you're not... again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!"
291,Joey,"Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part."
292,Phoebe,How could you possibly think that?
293,Joey,"For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!"
294,Ross,"Hey Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?"
295,Rachel,Sure.
296,Ross,You've been quiet all morning.

307,Ross,I was just trying to do the right thing.
308,Rachel,Really?
309,Rachel,"Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!"
310,Ross,Well...
311,Rachel,Oh stop that!
312,Ross,I can't believe this.
313,Ross,I was just being a good guy.

218,Ross,"Third marriage, well they really shouldn't allow you to get married when you're that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada's fault."
219,Phoebe,"Okay, so what do you think ladies?"
220,Phoebe,Who wouldn't be interested?
221,Phoebe,Who wouldn't want to date him?

232,Ross,We were drunk!
233,Ross,"I would've married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!"
234,Phoebe,Hey!
235,Phoebe,You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!
236,Ross,"Look, I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong."
237,Ross,I just don't want to be divorced three times.
238,Phoebe,"Yes, and now he's using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her."

306,Monica,Really well.
307,Monica,Yeah.
308,Monica,Surprisingly well.
309,Monica,"Yeah, she didn't cry."
310,Monica,She wasn't angry or sad.
311,Chandler,And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
312,Monica,"I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion!"
313,Monica,Is that too much to ask after six years?!
314,Monica,I mean what?
315,Monica,Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?!
316,Monica,I mean do we not have as much fun?!

330,Ross,"But, I-I do not love her."
331,Ross,This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.

333,Ross,Easy.
334,Ross,No problem.
335,Ross,Ooh!
336,Ross,There's no way to do this without her?
337,Ross,"Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of."
338,Ross,"Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel?"
339,Ross,I will think about the therapy.
340,Rachel,Hey!
341,Monica,Hey.
342,Monica,"So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff."
343,Rachel,Okay!
344,Monica,"Y'know, no point in dragging it out."
345,Monica,Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
346,Rachel,Okay.
347,Monica,"Hey Rach, what about this?"
348,Monica,Huh?
349,Monica,Who-who gets this?

354,Monica,I want you to have the big plate.
355,Rachel,Wow!
356,Rachel,"Mon, thanks!"
357,Rachel,I love this plate!
358,Monica,Something to remember me by!
359,Rachel,"Mon, honey you're not dying."
360,Rachel,I'm just moving out.
361,Rachel,"Y'know, I mean we're gonna see each other all the time."
362,Monica,"But still, it's a big change."
363,Monica,"The end of an era, you might say!"
364,Rachel,Are you okay?
365,Rachel,You're not blinking.
366,Monica,I'm fine!
367,Monica,"I just, I'm thinking how much it's an end of era."
368,Rachel,"Oh, all right."
369,Rachel,"But y'know I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years counts as an era."
370,Monica,An era is defined as a significant period of time.
371,Monica,"Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!"
372,Rachel,What is the matter with you?
373,Monica,What is the matter with you?!!
374,Monica,Why aren't you more upset?!
375,Monica,Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?!
376,Monica,I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?
377,Rachel,"All right, fine, but don't get mad at me."
378,Rachel,It's-it's just a little hard to believe.
379,Monica,What's hard to believe?
380,Rachel,"Well y'know, it's you guys."
381,Rachel,You-you do this kind of stuff!
382,Rachel,Y'know?
383,Rachel,"I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out!"
384,Rachel,I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you guys going through with it.
385,Rachel,I'm sorry.
386,Monica,"Rachel, it's going to happen."
387,Monica,Chandler is gonna move in here.
388,Rachel,But I
389,Monica,"No-no, wait!"
390,Monica,"Just let me finish, okay?"
391,Monica,"This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want."
392,Monica,And it is going to happen.
393,Rachel,It is?
394,Rachel,Really?
395,Monica,"Yeah, sweetie."
396,Rachel,"I mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore?"
397,Monica,No.
398,Rachel,What?
399,Rachel,Oh my God!
400,Rachel,I'm gonna miss you so much!
401,Monica,I'm gonna miss you!
402,Rachel,I mean it's the end of an era!
403,Monica,I know!
404,Phoebe,"Okay, bye!"
405,Ross,Oh no.
406,Phoebe,So?
407,Phoebe,Did you get the annulment?
408,Ross,I couldn't.
409,Phoebe,I knew it!
410,Phoebe,Because you love Rachel.
411,Ross,It's not that.
412,Ross,Okay?
413,Ross,Annulments are more complicated than I
414,Phoebe,"Yeah, complicated cause of the love."
415,Ross,"I I do, I do not love Rachel."
416,Ross,I'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible.
417,Ross,Okay?
418,Ross,Would I do that if I loved her?
419,Phoebe,I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
420,Ross,I do not have feelings for Rachel!
421,Ross,Okay?
422,Ross,"Ohh, what's wrong?"
423,Rachel,Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
424,Ross,Oh myCome here!
425,Ross,Come here!
426,Ross,It's okay.
427,Ross,Everything's gonna be okay.
428,Rachel,Thank you.

431,Joey,"So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?"
432,Phoebe,"Oh we do, but not just yet."

434,Joey,"Well, when?"
435,Phoebe,"Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way."
436,Phoebe,Yeah.
437,Phoebe,But it won't work out.
438,Joey,Wow.
439,Phoebe,I know.
440,Phoebe,"Then, I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money and you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids."
441,Joey,Great!
442,Phoebe,But then we ditch those two and that's when we get married.
443,Phoebe,We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.
444,Joey,"Oh-oh, what about Ross?"
445,Phoebe,"I don't want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him."
446,Phoebe,End

1,Chandler,This is the New York Times.
2,Joey,"Okay, may I see the comics?"
3,Monica,Guys.

5,Chandler,We are.
6,Chandler,He's meeting us here.
7,Monica,No!
8,Monica,Rachel is meeting us here.
9,Phoebe,"Oh come on, they can be in the same room."
10,Joey,"Yeah, you shoulda been there last night."

12,Phoebe,What happened now?
13,Joey,"Well Ross was hangin' out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler...."
14,Chandler,"Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something?"
15,Chandler,Rachel came over to borrow something.
16,Joey,Anyway!
17,Joey,Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
18,Phoebe,Wait.
19,Phoebe,Why was he yelling at her?
20,Phoebe,He's the one who slept with someone else.
21,Joey,"Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now."
22,Phoebe,Whoa!!
23,Phoebe,He is soo unreasonable!
24,Phoebe,"God, although I think I understand what he means."
25,Phoebe,"Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow."
26,Chandler,Y'know what this is like?
27,Chandler,This is like when my parents got divorced.
28,Chandler,"Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts."
29,Phoebe,"Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up."
30,Phoebe,"And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy...."
31,Joey,I had the same dream!
32,Phoebe,"Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl."
33,Joey,"Oh, I had the opposite dream."
34,Chandler,"Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay, I mean it's been a week."
35,Joey,"Yeah, I mean it's never taken me a week to get over a relationship."
36,Monica,It's never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
37,Monica,"Okay, let's go!!"
38,Monica,Let's hit the road!
39,Rachel,Hey!
40,Monica,Let's get the show on it!
41,Rachel,"Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee."
42,Monica,"Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it's sooo close."
43,Rachel,Closer than here?
44,Phoebe,"Oh, hey, look, I found coffee!"
45,Phoebe,"Okay, let's skedaddle."

70,Monica,We're sorry honey.
71,Rachel,"Oh, it's okay."
72,Joey,"Rach, it's, it's ah, it's not that we don't want to, really."
73,Joey,Are we talking models in their underwear?
74,Rachel,And heels.

92,Phoebe,Him?
93,Phoebe,"Him, Ross?"
94,Chandler,"Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow!"
95,Chandler,When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.
96,Rachel,Hi!
97,Rachel,"Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend?"
98,Rachel,"Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing."
99,Rachel,Huh?
100,Rachel,"I'm asking you first, right?!."
101,Rachel,I mean I'm playing by the rules.
102,Rachel,Chandler!
103,Rachel,You're smoking?
104,Rachel,What are you doing?
105,Chandler,"Hey, shut up!!"
106,Chandler,You're not my real Mom!

114,Chandler,Can somebody else hug him?
115,Chandler,I have to stay by the window.
116,Ross,"Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board?"

123,Ross,What's going on?
124,Phoebe,"Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel's sister's cabin."
125,Ross,"So, for the whole weekend?"
126,Monica,"We're really sorry, but um, she did ask us first."
127,Ross,"Yeah, that's okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I'm alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand."
128,Phoebe,"Y'know what, I can stay, I'm gonna stay."
129,Phoebe,"Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around."
130,Joey,"Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother's cab, but y'know what, I'll stay."

140,Chandler,"Well, then, I might as well offer to stay."
141,Joey,"Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?"
142,Monica,Why?
143,Monica,Do you think he's still mad at us?
144,Chandler,Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
145,Joey,What?
146,Joey,Mine aren't tinted.
147,Phoebe,Chandler!
148,Chandler,What?
149,Phoebe,What does the sign say?
150,Chandler,Beam me up Jesus.
151,Phoebe,"No, the No Smoking' sign."

168,Rachel,Thank you.
169,Monica,"No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms."
170,Rachel,"Well, they never have any paper in there y'know."
171,Rachel,"So my rule is no tissue, no tuschy.'"
172,Rachel,"Well, if everybody's going."
173,Phoebe,"No, y'know what don't close it  cause the... keys...are in there."

180,Joey,"Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open."
181,Joey,Anybody have a coat hanger?
182,Chandler,Oh I do!
183,Chandler,"Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning."
184,Monica,"So, if you're parents hadn't got divorced, you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?"
185,Joey,"Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it."
186,Joey,"Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!"
187,Monica,What?
188,Rachel,What?
189,Joey,Come on!

195,Phoebe,"Okay, Monica's are the biggest."
196,Monica,"These tiny, little non-breasts?!"
197,Monica,"Please, it's gotta be Rachel."
198,Rachel,"What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra."
199,Monica,"All right then, your bra would still be big."
200,Rachel,"No, I stuff outside the bra."
201,Chandler,"Ladies, ladies, let's just compromise okay?"
202,Chandler,"Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica's bra."
203,Phoebe,"All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine."
204,Rachel,"Chandler, what are you doing?"
205,Rachel,There is a trash can right there.
206,Chandler,"Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us."
207,Phoebe,"Okay, there."
208,Joey,"Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous."
209,Chandler,"Okay, now let's decide who has the nicest ass."
210,Joey,And there you go!
211,Monica,Chandler!
212,Chandler,At least let me smoke it to the good part.
213,Phoebe,Okay.
214,Phoebe,"Oh, no!"
215,Rachel,"What, what's it, what's going on?"
216,Phoebe,"Yeah, this has happened before."
217,Rachel,So you know how to fix it?
218,Phoebe,Yep.
219,Phoebe,Put more gas in.
220,Ross,Hey.
221,Ross,"Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?"
222,Ross,Where's Ben?
223,Ross,Ahh.
224,Ross,"Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?"
225,Ross,Oh!
226,Ross,"I thought you guys got married in uh, January?"
227,Ross,Ah!
228,Ross,Oh.
229,Ross,"Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great."
230,Ross,"Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know."
231,Ross,"Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up."
232,Ross,"Yeah, well."
233,Ross,"Oh yeah, I'd love that."
234,Ross,I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
235,Phoebe,"Okay, yeah."
236,Phoebe,Triple A can pick us up.
237,Rachel,Great!
238,Phoebe,"Yeah, what town are we near?"
239,Monica,Freemont.
240,Monica,"West-Westmont, ah Westburg?"
241,Phoebe,Then why are you answering?
242,Phoebe,Do you at least know what route we're on?
243,Rachel,"Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27."
244,Phoebe,Okay.
245,Phoebe,We are at a rest stop on Route 27.
246,Phoebe,Okay.
247,Phoebe,There is no Route 27.
248,Phoebe,"Okay, either 93 or 76?"
249,Rachel,"I don't know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here."
250,Phoebe,Okay.
251,Phoebe,"Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93?"
252,Phoebe,Okay!
253,Phoebe,"Yeah, no they don't do that."
254,Rachel,"Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us."
255,Monica,Who?
256,Monica,I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half?
257,Monica,"I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up."
258,Rachel,No!
259,Rachel,"No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!"
260,Phoebe,But if...
261,Rachel,"No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you'll have to think of something else."
262,Phoebe,"Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back."
263,Monica,So the going for help went well?
264,Joey,"Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed."
265,Chandler,I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
266,Monica,Then why are you smoking?
267,Chandler,Well it's very unsettling.
268,Ross,....right?
269,Ross,Right?
270,Ross,"I mean it's pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back."
271,Ross,"Y'know I don't, I don't need them, huh, I've got you guys now as friends, you and Susan."
272,Ross,717?
273,Ross,Where's 717?
274,Ross,"Hey, you've have more of these for Susan right?"
275,Phoebe,"Ross, thank God."
276,Ross,Pheebs?
277,Ross,"What, why are you whispering?"
278,Phoebe,I ate a bug.
279,Monica,"Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny."
280,Monica,Let's stock up.
281,Phoebe,"Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck."
282,Ross,"Oh, now you want a favour?"
283,Phoebe,"Yes, please."
284,Ross,"Well, oh, I'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?"
285,Ross,"No, I'm not gonna pick them up."
286,Ross,"No, Rachel doesn't want me to...."
287,Ross,"Yeah, you're right."
288,Ross,We were on a break!!!
289,Ross,Okay!!
290,Ross,"We were, we were...,  yeah."
291,Ross,Where are you?
292,Ross,I'll find you.
293,Ross,"Oh, you-you're-you're one to talk."
294,Joey,"Okay, done."
295,Monica,What's pleh'?
296,Joey,That's help' spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!
297,Monica,Huh.
298,Monica,What's doofus spelled backwards?
299,Rachel,"Op, op, car!"
300,Rachel,Car!!
301,Rachel,Ugh!!
302,Phoebe,"Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!"
303,Phoebe,Chandler and
304,Joey,Hey!
305,Phoebe,Hi!
306,Rachel,What is he doing here?
307,Ross,"He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I'm stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I've got plenty of people to help on the Interstate."
308,Rachel,All right!!
309,Rachel,Fine!
310,Rachel,Fine.
311,Joey,Arrrghh!
312,Chandler,"Oh no, now it's not gonna make any sense!"
313,Phoebe,"You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here?"
314,Phoebe,What do we do?
315,Phoebe,Just like send him back and we're then gonna go skiing?
316,Chandler,"Oh, this is horrible, it's just horrible."
317,Joey,"Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?"
318,Monica,"I know, what about Rachel?"
319,Monica,I mean how are we even gonna ask her?
320,Rachel,Ask me what?
321,Monica,"Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?"
322,Monica,"Chandler, Phoebe, and"
323,Joey,"No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no."
324,Rachel,You guys are unbelievable.
325,Rachel,No!
326,Rachel,He cannot come.
327,Ross,Excuse me?
328,Chandler,It's horrible.
329,Ross,"Oh please, can't I come to your special, magical cabin?"
330,Rachel,Why would you even want to come Ross?
331,Rachel,You're a horrible skier.
332,Ross,"Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills."
333,Monica,Here we go again.
334,Joey,"I-I can't handle this, you guys."
335,Chandler,"Y'know what, I can handle it, handle's my middle name."
336,Chandler,"Actually it's the ah, middle part of my first name."
337,Ross,"All right Pheebs, your cab's ready."
338,Rachel,"All right, let's go!"
339,Ross,You're welcome.
340,Rachel,"Oh, I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?"
341,Ross,We were on a break!
342,Rachel,Y'know Ross why don't you put that on your answering machine!
343,Ross,"Hey-hey, it's valid okay?"
344,Ross,"And I'm not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me."
345,Rachel,What?
346,Monica,I don't know.
347,Ross,That's what you said last night.
348,Monica,"What I said was, was that I understood."
349,Monica,Joey's the one who agreed with you!
350,Ross,Okay.
351,Rachel,Really Joey?
352,Joey,What?
353,Phoebe,"Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here."
354,Rachel,"No, I think it's very obvious who's wrong here."
355,Ross,Obviously not to Joey.
356,Joey,What?

106,Phoebe,No wait two!
107,Phoebe,Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
108,Chandler,"Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!"
109,Joey,You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
110,Chandler,Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
111,Monica,Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying!
112,Monica,I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.
113,Chandler,I'm not macho.
114,Monica,Yeah you're right.
115,Monica,I don't know what I was thinking.
116,Chandler,"No, I guess I just never really cried."
117,Chandler,Y'know?
118,Chandler,I'm not a crying kind of guy.
119,Joey,Come on man there's gotta be something that gets you choked up!
120,Joey,"Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?"
121,Chandler,"I'd be sad sure, but I wouldn't cry."
122,Joey,"Okay, what if the puppy said, ""Help me Chandler."
123,Joey,"All the other puppies pick on me."""

175,Rachel,Oh!
176,Rachel,There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob!
177,Rachel,He's a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
178,Rachel,"It's not random, it's Bob."
179,Rachel,"No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date?"

188,Rachel,I'm not telling you what to do!
189,Rachel,I am telling you what not to do!
190,Rachel,Jill this is not about me being jealous of you!

192,Rachel,Wanting what you can't have!
193,Rachel,"All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!"
194,Rachel,In Human Resources!!!!!

216,Joey,Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
217,Ross,"And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn't know he was in there."
218,Rachel,Wow!
219,Rachel,"I mean, I justI can't, I can't believe this."
220,Rachel,"Y'know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who's always been somewhat of a question mark."
221,Monica,This is so bizarre.
222,Monica,"I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood."
223,Chandler,"Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn."
224,Monica,"Yes, but you are dead inside."
225,Joey,"All right well, I'd better take that back."
226,Monica,"Wh-what, why?"
227,Joey,We can't watch that!
228,Joey,I mean that's Phoebe!
229,Monica,"Yeah you're right, we can'twe shouldn't watch this."
230,Rachel,Absolutely not.
231,Monica,Y'know maybe a little bit!
232,Rachel,Probably just the first half.
233,Joey,No!
234,Joey,Hey no!
235,Joey,This is wrong you guys!
236,Joey,Phoebe's our friend!
237,Joey,"Well, I'm not gonna watch it!"

242,Joey,"Suddenly, the vampire opens his coffin and sits up."
243,Joey,"Buffay, the Vampire"
244,Monica,Hold on a second!
245,Monica,What is that on her ankle?
246,Chandler,Her ankle is what you're watching?
247,Rachel,"Well it's hard to tell  Oh God, if she would just stop moving."
248,Chandler,She's just doing her job!
249,Joey,You sick bastards!
250,Rachel,"Oh, it's a tattoo!"
251,Rachel,"That's weird, Phoebe doesn't Wait that's Ursula!"

266,Chandler,There's no back to this couch!
267,Monica,Why are you reading this?
268,Monica,You hate this kind of stuff.
269,Chandler,"Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know?"
270,Chandler,"Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside."
271,Monica,Oh that's so sweet!
272,Monica,"Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you."
273,Chandler,Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
274,Monica,Stop it!
275,Chandler,"No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this."
276,Monica,"I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here."
277,Chandler,Yeah?
278,Monica,Yeah!
279,Monica,"And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what!"
280,Monica,"And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me."
281,Chandler,"Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then."
282,Monica,"And-and-and if I die, from a long illness."
283,Monica,"And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, ""I will always be with you,"" and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside."
284,Chandler,"Aww, I love you so"
285,Monica,What is wrong with you?!!
286,Chandler,What?
287,Monica,What?!
288,Monica,You can't shed a tear for your dead wife!!
289,Monica,"Now, I left you a note from the beyond!"
290,Chandler,So you didn't mean any of that?
291,Monica,No you robot!
292,Ross,You damn kids!
293,Ross,"You ring my bell one more time, I swear to  Ohh, uh Jill."
294,Ross,"Umm, that-that's just a little game I play with the kids down the hall."
295,Ross,"Umm, they've really taken a liking to me."
296,Ross,Uhh what's-what's-what's the matter?
297,Ross,"Of course, what happened?"
298,Ross,"Okay, umm"
299,Ross,What?
300,Ross,Wow!
301,Ross,Really?
302,Ross,"Well, I'd love to!"
303,Ross,"Here, you wait right here and I'll go get the projector and my notes!"
304,Ross,Ohh!
305,Ross,(He goes into another room to get his projector and notes.
306,Ross,"While he's gone, Jill quickly checks her makeup."
307,Rachel,Hey!
308,Rachel,Have you guys seen Jill?
309,Rachel,I can't find her anywhere.
310,Monica,"No, I haven't."
311,Rachel,"Well, is Ross home?"
312,Rachel,Maybe I'll just call him to see if he's actually seen her.
313,Phoebe,It's Phoebe!
314,Phoebe,Phoebe!
315,Phoebe,Oh God.
316,Phoebe,So-so you're making porn movies.
317,Phoebe,You're making one right now!
318,Phoebe,Another Man's
319,Phoebe,And-and you're using my name!
320,Phoebe,"Look, I'm talking right now!"
321,Phoebe,You'reyou mean her.
322,Phoebe,What?
323,Phoebe,No!!
324,Phoebe,No way!
325,Phoebe,No!
326,Phoebe,And stop using my name!
327,Phoebe,And shame on you!
328,Phoebe,And shame on all of you!
329,Phoebe,You're disgusting!
330,Phoebe,Especially you  with that!
331,Ross,Slides are almost ready.
332,Ross,"Uh okay, well there's-there's wine in the kitchen."
333,Ross,Hello?
334,Rachel,What is my sister doing there?!
335,Rachel,And why are the drapes shut?
336,Ross,"O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay?"
337,Ross,She-she's really upset we're just talking.
338,Rachel,Ross!
339,Rachel,I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
340,Ross,So that's the only reason she could be here huh?
341,Ross,It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
342,Rachel,"Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!"
343,Ross,Y'know what?
344,Ross,"I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later."
345,Ross,Good-bye.
346,Ross,Whoa!
347,Ross,"Uh, that was your sister actually."
348,Ross,She-she thinks that you're just using me.
349,Phoebe,Hey!
350,Joey,Hey!
351,Phoebe,"So, I just came from the company Ursula works for."
352,Joey,"Oh no, not you too!"
353,Phoebe,No!
354,Phoebe,No!
355,Phoebe,I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay's checks; there were a lot of them.
356,Joey,Nice!
357,Phoebe,"Um-mmm, and I won't have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address."
358,Joey,"That's great, but isn't it gonna bother that people still think you're a porn star?"
359,Phoebe,Oh no!
360,Phoebe,No!
361,Phoebe,I know how to handle it.
362,Joey,You do?
363,Phoebe,Yeah.
364,Phoebe,You're trying to figure out where you know me from?
365,Phoebe,"All right, I'll give you a hint."
366,Phoebe,From porn!
367,Phoebe,Okay?
368,Phoebe,Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie!
369,Phoebe,See?
370,Joey,Yeah.
371,Chandler,Hey.
372,Ross,"You uh, you may have been right about Jill."
373,Rachel,Oh!
374,Rachel,I knew it!
375,Rachel,What happened?
376,Ross,"Umm, she kissed me."
377,Rachel,What?!
378,Rachel,You kissed!
379,Chandler,Maybe we should give them some privacy.
380,Monica,Shhhh!!
381,Ross,"Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?"
382,Rachel,"Well, it doesn't sound like it!"
383,Rachel,"I mean, it's pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don't kiss them!"
384,Rachel,"See look at us, right now, not kissing!"
385,Ross,"Let me finish, okay?"
386,Ross,She started kissing me and-and I didn't stop it.
387,Ross,I guess I-I just wasn't thinking
388,Rachel,Yeah that's right you weren't thinking!
389,Rachel,Y'know what?
390,Rachel,Let me give you something to think about!
391,Ross,Oh waithold it!
392,Ross,But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
393,Rachel,"Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that."
394,Ross,Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
395,Rachel,What?
396,Ross,"No, I mean, look I don't know if anything is going to happen with us, again."
397,Ross,Ever.
398,Ross,But I don't want to know that it-it never could.
399,Ross,So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
400,Rachel,Wow.
401,Rachel,"I, I don't even know what to say."
402,Rachel,Thank you.
403,Ross,You're welcome.
404,Monica,Oh my God!
405,Monica,Are-are you crying?
406,Chandler,I just don't see why those two can't work things out!
407,Chandler,Ending Credits
408,Rachel,"Yeah, I got that."
409,Ross,You take care Jill.
410,Rachel,Bye-bye-e!
411,Monica,Bye.

413,Chandler,"I can't help it, I opened a gate."
414,Chandler,End
0,Rachel,"You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her    first cookie."
1,Joey,Her first cookie?
2,Joey,She has cookies all the time!
3,Rachel,I've never given her a cookie.
4,Rachel,Have you?
5,Joey,No!
6,Joey,"No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from    a can!"
7,Monica,"Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we    were wondering if you would write one for us."
8,Rachel,"Of course, I'd be honored!"
9,Chandler,Thanks!
10,Monica,Thank you!
11,Joey,"U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight."
12,Chandler,"Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested."
13,Monica,"Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much ""with    the words""."
14,Joey,Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!
15,Monica,Clearly we were wrong.
16,Joey,"I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok?"
17,Joey,"And I know how    much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one."
18,Monica,You know what?
19,Monica,"Then, Joey, we want you to do it."
20,Joey,Thank you!
21,Joey,"Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... ""Dear baby    adoption decider people..."""
22,Chandler,So excited about your letter!
23,Phoebe,Hey!
24,Joey,Hey!

31,Rachel,"Your first date, your first kiss,    first time you had sex..."
32,Phoebe,YEAH!
33,Chandler,So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
34,Phoebe,Uh-uh.
35,Phoebe,"Ehm, a Knicks game."
36,Joey,Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?
37,Phoebe,"Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so    no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and..."
38,Phoebe,I'm gonna put    on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room.
39,Monica,You guys do that?
40,Monica,Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom!
41,Chandler,That's where people make number two!!
42,Chandler,OPENING CREDITS
43,Ross,Hey...
44,Ross,Oh...   Ohh...

55,Ross,I had a baby with your sister!
56,Ross,"Yes, yes, you did."
57,Ross,Hi Rachel!

65,Joey,"That's right, yeah."
66,Joey,Always nice to meet a fan!
67,Rachel,"So now, what are you doing here?"
68,Rachel,"Oh sorry, hold on."
69,Rachel,Let me just    check on the baby!
70,Ross,Ehm...
71,Ross,Her name is Emma.
72,Ross,What do I know?
73,Ross,I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!
74,Ross,Oh my God!
75,Joey,"I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated."
76,Ross,What... what you working on?
77,Joey,"Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation."
78,Joey,I want it    to sound smart but..
79,Joey,"I don't know any big words or anything, so..."
80,Ross,Why don't you use your Thesaurus?
81,Joey,What did I just say?
82,Ross,Watch.
83,Ross,"Here, you ehm... You highlight the word    you want to change."
84,Ross,Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list    of choices.
85,Ross,You can pick the word that sounds smartest.
86,Joey,"Oh my God, that's great!"
87,Joey,I'm smart!!
88,Joey,"No, no, I'm...     ""brainy, bright, clever"", I love this thing!"
89,Joey,"Look out ladies, Joey    Tribbiani's got the whole package!"
90,Rachel,God!
91,Rachel,"Oh, I know, isn't she?"
92,Rachel,All right.
93,Rachel,"What's your news, Amy?"
94,Rachel,What?
95,Rachel,Oh my God!
96,Rachel,To who?
97,Rachel,A-And?
98,Rachel,"No, what's he like?"
99,Rachel,Yeah.
100,Rachel,"Huh... wow, so he's gotta be..."
101,Rachel,"Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the    apartment more than you like..."
102,Rachel,"Oh... sit down, sit down."
103,Rachel,"Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married    somebody that I didn’t love."
104,Rachel,Do you remember Barry?
105,Rachel,"Sometimes just nodding is ok.  Uhm, so but   anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever   made."
106,Rachel,"Honey, you deserve   true love."
107,Rachel,"Your soulmate is out there, somewhere."
108,Rachel,"Someone that is your age,   that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!"
109,Rachel,Ok.
110,Rachel,"Ok, let’s keep talking."
111,Phoebe,"Excuse me, anniversary."
112,Phoebe,"Excuse me, anniversary."
113,Phoebe,"Uhm, sir, could you move your nachos... they’re in my    seat."
114,Phoebe,It's my anniversary.
115,Phoebe,Here we are!
116,Phoebe,Can’t believe    it's been a whole year!
117,Phoebe,ME TOO!
118,Phoebe,I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!
119,Phoebe,YOU’RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND  YOU'RE    AMAZING IN BED   IT’S    OUR ANNIVERSARY!
120,Phoebe,"Oh how lame... oh, it’s so tacky, and impersonal."
121,Phoebe,"Oh, it’s the worst way to propose!"
122,Joey,"Hey, finished my recommendation."
123,Joey,Here.
124,Joey,"And I think you’ll be very, very happy."
125,Joey,It’s the    longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.
126,Chandler,I don’t... uh... understand.
127,Joey,Some of the words are a little too sophisticated    for ya?
128,Monica,It doesn’t make any sense.
129,Joey,Of course it does!
130,Joey,It’s smart!
131,Joey,I used the the-saurus!
132,Chandler,On every word?
133,Joey,Yep!
134,Monica,"Alright, what was this sentence originally?"
135,Joey,"Oh, ‘They are warm, nice, people with big hearts’."
136,Chandler,And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens    with full sized aortic pumps...?
137,Joey,"Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude."
138,Monica,"Hey Joey, I don’t think we can use this."
139,Joey,Why not?
140,Monica,"Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani ."
141,Monica,"Hey, why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just    be yourself!"
142,Chandler,You know what?
143,Chandler,"You don’t need a thesaurus, just write from  here,  your full sized aortic pump."
144,Rachel,"Amy, hi!"
145,Rachel,"Oh, good for you!"
146,Rachel,Yes you are!
147,Rachel,"Oh, I am so proud of you!"
148,Rachel,But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
149,Joey,"Ah, look who’s back!"
150,Joey,Why do you have bags?
151,Joey,"RACH,    WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?"
152,Joey,What?
153,Joey,You slept out here?
154,Rachel,"Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‘Myron, get    off!’"
155,Joey,"But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right?"
156,Joey,"Rach, please tell me we’re    getting rid of her."
157,Rachel,"Joey, I can’t do that!"
158,Joey,"Oh, come on!"
159,Joey,"Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said  ""Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!"""
160,Joey,I don’t need that kind of talk in my house!
161,Rachel,"Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she’s difficult, but I think    it’s really good that she’s here."
162,Joey,'Cause we will appreciate it more when she’s gone?
163,Rachel,"No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was    a lot like her!"
164,Rachel,"I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of    me."
165,Joey,"Yeah, Monica made us!"
166,Rachel,"Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don’t    think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn’t for you guys."
167,Rachel,"See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me."
168,Rachel,"And I know it’s gonna    take patience, but that’s ok."
169,Joey,Yeaah.
170,Rachel,"Amy, that’s what I was supposed to wear today, that’s why    I hung it on the door."
171,Rachel,"Amy, you know what?"
172,Rachel,"I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time    for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future."
173,Joey,"I’M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!"
174,Phoebe,Hi.
175,Phoebe,I just had the worst anniversary ever.
176,Chandler,I doubt that!
177,Chandler,Tell her about us last year.
178,Monica,"Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote    me a rap song."
179,Ross,Seriously?
180,Chandler,Word!
181,Phoebe,"Well, mine was worse than that."
182,Rachel,"Well, what happened?"
183,Phoebe,"We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the    big screen thing..."
184,Rachel,"Oh, that is so tacky."
185,Phoebe,"Well, that’s what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning    on proposing to me that same way last night!"
186,Monica,"Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?"
187,Rachel,"Phoebe, that’s huge!"
188,Ross,"Well, do you wanna marry him?"
189,Phoebe,"Yeah, I really do!"
190,Phoebe,"Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna    propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again!"
191,Phoebe,"I mean,    I said no in Barbados and now this!"
192,Chandler,She's right!
193,Chandler,If I were a guy and...  Did I just say if I were a   guy..?
194,Monica,"Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to    him!"
195,Phoebe,"Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?"
196,Monica,I proposed to Chandler!
197,Monica,"Alright,    moving on..."
198,Chandler,"Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!"
199,Monica,Thank you.
200,Phoebe,"Well, do you think   I should propose?"
201,Rachel,I think it could be kind of great!
202,Ross,Absolutely!
203,Ross,You'll love the feeling!
204,Ross,There's nothing like it!
205,Phoebe,"Ok, ok, so how should I do it?"
206,Monica,"How about at a game, on the big screen?"
207,Rachel,Uuuh!!
208,Rachel,How about at a Footlocker?
209,Monica,What?
210,Monica,what?
211,Monica,"He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to,    plus he'd never suspect it!"
212,Phoebe,"Yeah, that does make sense."
213,Phoebe,"Ok, now, would... would you two  like that?"
214,Chandler,Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
215,Rachel,Oh!
216,Rachel,"That's interesting, since she died seven years    ago!"
217,Rachel,Hello?
218,Rachel,"Oh, it's our nanny!"
219,Rachel,Hi!
220,Rachel,Oh... God!
221,Rachel,I hope you feel better!
222,Rachel,"Ok, bye!"
223,Rachel,"That's Molly, she's sick."
224,Rachel,Can you watch Emma today?
225,Ross,"No, I can't."
226,Ross,I have back-to-back classes.
227,Ross,Did Molly say what she had?
228,Ross,Because my throat's been hurting?
229,Rachel,Menstrual cramps.
230,Ross,I don't think that's what this is.
231,Rachel,Can any of you watch Emma?
232,Monica,"No, sorry sweety.."
233,Phoebe,"No, I've got work and then I'm proposing.."
234,Rachel,"Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?"
235,Rachel,"Well, actually..."
236,Ross,"Well, can I talk to you for a sec."
237,Rachel,Yeah.
238,Ross,"Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child."
239,Rachel,Why not?
240,Ross,"Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!"
241,Rachel,"Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!"
242,Ross,"Fine, we'll call the next one Ella."
243,Rachel,Wha... the next one?
244,Ross,"Okay, um..."
245,Ross,I don't want her watching our baby.
246,Rachel,"Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person."
247,Rachel,This is a huge    breakthrough for her!
248,Rachel,She just offered to do something for another human being!
249,Ross,I...
250,Ross,I don't know..
251,Rachel,"Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows  shaped to do this alright?"
252,Rachel,Do you understand    how important that is in our world?
253,Rachel,Absolutely.
254,Chandler,Hey Joe!
255,Chandler,How's the second draft of the letter coming?
256,Joey,"Great, I'm finished!"
257,Joey,"In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency."
258,Monica,You dropped it off?
259,Joey,Yeah.
260,Chandler,Can we read it?
261,Chandler,Can you print out another copy?
262,Joey,No can do amigo.
263,Joey,"No, I didn't use the computer."
264,Joey,Felt more personal to    hand-write it.
265,Monica,You hand-wrote it?
266,Joey,"Yeah, and don't worry."
267,Joey,I didn't try to sound smart at   all!
268,Joey,See ya later!
269,Monica,"Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our    file!"
270,Monica,We're never gonna get a kid.
271,Monica,"No, we're gonna be one of those old couples    that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!"
272,Chandler,"It's ok, it's ok. You know what?"
273,Chandler,I'll just    call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter.
274,Monica,Okay good.
275,Chandler,"Hello, this is Chandler Bing."
276,Chandler,"Somebody just dropped    off a handwritten recommendation letter, and..  Uh-huh... Uh-huh...    okay... thank you."
277,Chandler,Good-bye.
278,Monica,"Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we?"
279,Monica,You know what?
280,Monica,Just tell me on the way    to the bird store.
281,Chandler,They loved it.
282,Monica,What?
283,Chandler,They thought it was very smart of us to have a   child write the recommendation letter.
284,Monica,They thought Joey was a child?
285,Chandler,"She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings."
286,Monica,"Hey, what did you guys do today?"
287,Chandler,That sounds like fun.
288,Rachel,Hey!
289,Rachel,"Hi, how's my girl?"
290,Rachel,Yeah!
291,Rachel,You pierced her ears!
292,Rachel,You pierced her ears?
293,Rachel,How could you do this without telling me?
294,Chandler,I think she looks cute.
295,Chandler,... but I am wrong!
296,Rachel,"Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross."
297,Rachel,He's gonna flip out.
298,Rachel,Ugh.
299,Ross,Hey guys.
300,Ross,Monica and
301,Chandler,Hi Ross.
302,Ross,Hey Emma.
303,Ross,"Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low?"
304,Ross,She can barely see.
305,Rachel,"Nah, I don't really want her to see."
306,Ross,Why not?
307,Monica,Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
308,Chandler,Like war.
309,Chandler,Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator.
310,Chandler,Remember?
311,Chandler,It was    in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
312,Ross,Come here  Oh!
313,Ross,There she is!
314,Ross,Hi!
315,Ross,What?
316,Rachel,Nothing.
317,Ross,Hi!
318,Ross,What... .
319,Ross,Please tell me those are clip-ons.
320,Rachel,"Oh, they're real!"
321,Ross,Did she  do this to her?
322,Ross,I told you we shouldn't have    left Emma with her!
323,Rachel,"I know, I know, and you were right Ross."
324,Rachel,You are soo irresponsible   I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!
325,Monica,"I'm a cool, fun aunt!"
326,Chandler,Hey!
327,Chandler,Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
328,Rachel,I can't believe this.
329,Rachel,All I wanted to do was help you try to figure    out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?
330,Rachel,Oh yeah?
331,Rachel,Since when?
332,Rachel,What?
333,Ross,That's not a thing!
334,Rachel,Babies don't care if they're slim.
335,Ross,"Amy, I ju..."
336,Ross,I just...
337,Ross,I just wanna...
338,Ross,No more falafel for you!
339,Phoebe,"Uhuh, uhuh..."
340,Phoebe,I'm not.
341,Phoebe,I'm praying.
342,Phoebe,Please let the Knicks win...
343,Phoebe,Thank    you Thor!
344,Phoebe,Where... where are you going?
345,Phoebe,"Well, I think you should wait."
346,Phoebe,"Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the    nutrients."
347,Phoebe,Mike Hannigan... will you marry me?
348,Phoebe,That's not very enlightened!
349,Phoebe,"Hey, hey!"
350,Phoebe,Boo us?
351,Phoebe,Boo you!
352,Joey,Hello?
353,Joey,"Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani...    Oh, hi!"
354,Joey,"Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home    right now..."
355,Joey,"Okay, bye bye."
356,Joey,She was    nice!
357,Rachel,"Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!"
358,Joey,Whoo-hoo!
359,Rachel,You put holes in my baby's ears!
360,Rachel,I can't believe I ever even tried to help   you.
361,Rachel,You are so  beyond help.
362,Rachel,Excuse me?
363,Rachel,"Joey, where are those bags?"
364,Joey,She has a lot of crap!
365,Rachel,Seriously?
366,Rachel,Hips or thighs?
367,Rachel,Oh!
368,Rachel,Oh my God!
369,Rachel,I thought she was on Atkins.
370,Rachel,"Oh, I can give you that."
371,Rachel,Yeah.
372,Rachel,"I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're...    you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are."
373,Rachel,Did you just say Emma?
374,Phoebe,That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking    about.
375,Phoebe,"Mike, obviously you have balls."
376,Phoebe,I would love it.
377,Phoebe,Consider    it forgotten...
378,Phoebe,"But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose,    I promise I'll say yes."
379,Phoebe,"Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball    game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who    hides it in the cake."
380,Phoebe,"It's in the cake, isn't it?"
381,Phoebe,What's the matter with me?
382,Phoebe,How do I keep ruining this?
383,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, I'm    sorry!"
384,Phoebe,Oh my God!
385,Phoebe,Wait!
386,Phoebe,Oh wait!
387,Phoebe,Oh no!
388,Phoebe,Uh-huh!
389,Phoebe,Yes!
390,Phoebe,I love you more!
391,Rachel,So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?
392,Rachel,That's shocking!
0,Joey,I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
1,Chandler,Huh.
2,Chandler,Opening Credits
3,Ross,I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.
4,Rachel,Nooo Way!
5,Rachel,The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
6,Phoebe,"See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's The Boss."
7,Rachel,"What song was that, Pheebs?"
8,Phoebe,"Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za."
9,Phoebe,Hi Monica!
10,Ross,Hey Mon!
11,Rachel,Hey Mon!
12,Phoebe,"Oh my God, has she slept at all?"
13,Ross,Nope.
14,Rachel,"No, it's been three nights in a row."
15,Ross,"Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so."
16,Phoebe,"Oh, okay that explains it."
17,Phoebe,"I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum."
18,Phoebe,But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.
19,Chandler,Morning.
20,Joey,"Morning, hey, you made pancakes?"
21,Chandler,"Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that."
22,Joey,Good morning.
23,Chandler,"Hey, you know what, here's a thought."
24,Chandler,Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
25,Chandler,I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced.
26,Chandler,I'm such a grown up.
27,Chandler,"Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay."
28,Joey,Kiss her!
29,Joey,Kiss her!
30,Joey,B-bye Janice.
31,Joey,So when ya' dumpin' her.
32,Chandler,"Nope, not this time."
33,Joey,"Come on, quite yankin' me."
34,Chandler,I'm not yanking you.
35,Joey,This is Janice.
36,Chandler,"Yeah, I know."
37,Chandler,She makes me happy.
38,Joey,Okay.
39,Joey,All right.
40,Joey,"You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her."
41,Joey,No blinking.
42,Chandler,I'm not breaking up with her!
43,Monica,"God, look what I found in the drain."
44,Rachel,What?
45,Monica,It's some of Richard's hair!
46,Monica,What do I do with this?
47,Ross,Getting it away from me would be job one.
48,Monica,"It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away."
49,Monica,"I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair."
50,Monica,Ooh!
51,Phoebe,Ooh.
52,Phoebe,Oh.
53,Phoebe,"It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal."
54,Monica,"God, what is wrong with me."
55,Ross,You need to get some sleep.
56,Monica,I need to get some Richard.
57,Rachel,"Monica, you broke up with him for a reason."
58,Monica,"I know, I know."
59,Monica,I'm just so tired of-of missing him.
60,Monica,I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called.
61,Monica,Why hasn't he called!
62,Phoebe,"Maybe, because you told him not to."
63,Monica,What are you the memory woman?
64,Joey,Their not breaking up.
65,Joey,Chandler and Janice.
66,Joey,Their not breaking up.
67,Joey,He didn't blink or anything.
68,Rachel,"Well, you know I'm not surprised."
69,Rachel,"I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute."
70,Joey,Cute!
71,Joey,This is Janice!
72,Joey,You remember Janice?
73,Rachel,"Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now."
74,Rachel,I mean what can we do?
75,Joey,There you go!
76,Joey,That's the spirit I'm looking for!
77,Joey,What can we do?
78,Joey,Huh?
79,Joey,All right who's first?
80,Joey,Huh?
81,Joey,Ross?
82,Ross,"Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her."
83,Joey,"Yeah, we'll call that Plan B."
84,Joey,All right?
85,Rachel,"Honey, I was wondering...."
86,Ross,Hmm?
87,Rachel,"Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?"
88,Ross,"Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place."
89,Rachel,Hmm.
90,Ross,I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
91,Rachel,"You remember not having sex in high school, right?"
92,Ross,Yeah.
93,Rachel,"Well honey, what about you?"
94,Ross,What?
95,Rachel,"I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?"
96,Ross,No.
97,Rachel,Come on you gotta have one!
98,Ross,Nope.
99,Rachel,"Ross, you know what..."
100,Ross,What?
101,Rachel,"...if you tell me, I might do it."
102,Ross,"Okay, umm."
103,Ross,"Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?"
104,Rachel,Yeah.
105,Ross,"Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut?"
106,Ross,"Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia."
107,Rachel,Oooh!
108,Ross,"Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing."
109,Ross,It was pretty cool.
110,Phoebe,"Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that."
111,Rachel,Really!
112,Phoebe,"Um, um."
113,Phoebe,It's huge.
114,Phoebe,"Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know."
115,Rachel,Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?
116,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah, um-mm."
117,Phoebe,Oh!
118,Rachel,Really!
119,Rachel,That-that great huh?
120,Phoebe,No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate.
121,Phoebe,See ya!
122,Ross,Hey!
123,Rachel,Hi you guys!
124,Ross,Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.
125,Rachel,Mon.
126,Rachel,Hi!
127,Monica,Hi.
128,Rachel,Why aren't you at work?
129,Monica,"Oh, they-they sent me home."
130,Rachel,Why?
131,Monica,Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
132,Ross,Okay.
133,Rachel,"You really, really need to get some sleep, honey."
134,Monica,I know I do.
135,Ross,Hi.
136,Rachel,Hi.
137,Ross,Guess what?
138,Rachel,What?
139,Ross,They published my paper.
140,Rachel,"Oh, really, let me see, let me see."
141,Phoebe,"Rach, look!"
142,Phoebe,"Oh, hi!"
143,Phoebe,Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me.
144,Phoebe,There he is.
145,Chandler,Hey!
146,Joey,Wheel!
147,Chandler,Of!
148,Joey,Fortune!
149,Joey,This guy is so stupid.
150,Joey,It's Count Rushmore!
151,Chandler,"You know, you should really go on this show."
152,Chandler,"All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight."
153,Chandler,What'd ya' say?
154,Joey,"I say, 'I am there!'"
155,Joey,Cool!
156,Joey,"Aw, is Ross going to?"
157,Chandler,"No, Janice."
158,Joey,Jan-ice.
159,Joey,"'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers."
160,Chandler,"You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?"
161,Joey,"No, Yeeees."
162,Joey,"God, how do I say this."
163,Joey,"Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?"
164,Chandler,"Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!"
165,Joey,"Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know."
166,Chandler,"Well, there you go."
167,Joey,"Oh, hey."
168,Joey,"Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?"
169,Chandler,"Well, I'm crazy about her now."
170,Chandler,I think this could be the real thing.
171,Chandler,Capital 'R'!
172,Chandler,Capital 'T'!
173,Chandler,"Don't worry, those are the right letters."
174,Joey,"Look, what do you want me to say?"
175,Chandler,I want you to say that you like her!
176,Joey,I can't.
177,Joey,"It's like this chemical thing, you know."
178,Joey,"Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna  pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her."
179,Chandler,Thanks for trying.
180,Chandler,"Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!"
181,Joey,"Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?"
182,Joey,Commercial Break
183,Ross,How could you have told her?
184,Rachel,"Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal."
185,Ross,"Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal."
186,Rachel,"Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?"
187,Ross,"Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us."
188,Rachel,"Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything."
189,Rachel,"You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff."
190,Ross,"That's different, okay."
191,Ross,"That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?'"
192,Ross,or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?
193,Ross,'.
194,Rachel,Were both of those Joey?
195,Ross,Yeah.
196,Ross,"Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her."
197,Rachel,Not even with your best friend.
198,Ross,Noo!
199,Rachel,That is so sad.
200,Rachel,"Your missing out on so much, Ross."
201,Rachel,"I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know."
202,Rachel,And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.
203,Ross,Hmph.
204,Ross,"So what you, you tell each other everything?"
205,Rachel,Pretty much.
206,Ross,Did you talk about the night of five times?
207,Ross,Do you tell people about the night of five times?
208,Rachel,"Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol."
209,Ross,"I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think."
210,Phoebe,Relax every muscle in your body.
211,Phoebe,Listen to the plinky-plunky music.
212,Phoebe,"Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place."
213,Phoebe,"Okay, tell me your happy place."
214,Monica,"Richard's living room, drinking wine."
215,Phoebe,All right.
216,Phoebe,"No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass."
217,Phoebe,And get out!
218,Monica,"I'm sorry, but that's my happy place."
219,Phoebe,"Well, okay, fine, use my happy place."
220,Phoebe,"Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything."
221,Monica,"All right, I'll try not to."
222,Phoebe,"Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky...."
223,Monica,Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
224,Phoebe,"All right, there are no questions in the happy place."
225,Phoebe,"Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees...."
226,Monica,"I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine."
227,Phoebe,"All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place."
228,Phoebe,Okay.
229,Phoebe,"Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains."
230,Phoebe,And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
231,Monica,"Okay, this isn't working."
232,Monica,I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
233,Joey,"I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that."
234,Joey,And you got a 'hate' from that?!
235,Joey,Your taking a big leap there...
236,Joey,But what does that gonna do...
237,Joey,Okay.
238,Joey,I'm in.
239,Joey,Does it have to be a whole day?
240,Joey,"Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room."
241,Monica,"So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War."
242,Monica,He loved the Civil War.
243,Phoebe,"Monica, do you want us to take you home?"
244,Monica,"Uh, huh."
245,Monica,"Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away."
246,Ross,Women tell each other everything.
247,Ross,Did you know that?
248,Chandler,"Umm, yeah."
249,Ross,"No Chandler, everything!"
250,Ross,"Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth...."
251,Chandler,Girth?
252,Chandler,"Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?"
253,Ross,"Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it."
254,Ross,Do you wanna?
255,Chandler,We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
256,Ross,Nooo!
257,Chandler,"Yeah, okay."
258,Ross,Yeah?
259,Chandler,Yeah!
260,Chandler,All right!
261,Chandler,You go first.
262,Ross,"Okay, okay, I'll go first."
263,Chandler,Okay.
264,Ross,"So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing...."
265,Chandler,Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
266,Ross,Yes!
267,Chandler,I know!
268,Ross,Yes!
269,Ross,"Wow, well, that-that was easy."
270,Ross,"Okay, you-you go."
271,Chandler,Okay.
272,Ross,Okay.
273,Chandler,"Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman."
274,Ross,Hmph.
275,Chandler,"And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her."
276,Chandler,"And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place...."
277,Ross,With the belly-button ring?
278,Ross,"Oh, muhawa!"
279,Chandler,"I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head."
280,Chandler,"And your like 'Mom, get outta here!'"
281,Chandler,"You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing."
282,Chandler,"So it's kinda like, you're, you know."
283,Chandler,You know.... You don't know!
284,Ross,"Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?"
285,Chandler,You said...
286,Ross,I said 'share' not 'scare'.
287,Ross,Go sit over there!
288,Joey,Hey!
289,Chandler,What are you guys doing together?
290,Chandler,Really.
291,Joey,"Yeah, yeah."
292,Joey,"We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman."
293,Joey,You have got competition buddy.
294,Chandler,You still can't stand her can you?
295,Joey,"I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did."
296,Chandler,"Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot."
297,Joey,"But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she."
298,Joey,It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
299,Chandler,"Well, I guess that's something."
300,Joey,"No man, that's huge!"
301,Joey,"Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway."
302,Chandler,Okay.
303,Joey,"Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross."
304,Chandler,Oh God!
305,Joey,"Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too."
306,Chandler,Really?
307,Joey,"Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex."
308,Monica,"Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?"
309,Monica,Mr.

321,Monica,Mr.
322,Monica,Really!
323,Monica,Mr.
324,Monica,You're not just saying that are you?
325,Monica,Mr.
326,Monica,Was he crying?
327,Monica,Mr.
328,Monica,"Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?"
329,Monica,Mr.
330,Monica,I think so.
331,Monica,Mr.
332,Rachel,"Okay, here we go."
333,Rachel,"I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face."
334,Rachel,What?
335,Rachel,"Honey, what is it?"
336,Rachel,Did I get it wrong?
337,Rachel,Did I get the hair wrong?
338,Rachel,What?
339,Rachel,Did you just picture it differently?
340,Rachel,What?
341,Rachel,What?
342,Ross,"No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's  Mrs."
343,Ross,"I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life."

136,Monica,Chicken Kiev?
137,Ross,Um-hmm!
138,Ross,Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
139,Monica,"Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken."
140,Monica,"And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella."
141,Monica,But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella...
142,Monica,"So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!"
143,Ross,Yeah.
144,Ross,Yeah.
145,Ross,"Yes, this place is beautiful."

163,Chandler,"Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place."
164,Joey,Really?
165,Joey,To what?
166,Chandler,To Put the Camera Away!!
167,Joey,"Man, you are Westminster Crabby."

169,Monica,You'll find some place to get married.
170,Monica,Oowww!
171,Monica,You're gonna find a place.
172,Monica,But even if - God forbid - you didn't..
173,Monica,So you postpone the wedding.
174,Monica,Is that really so bad?
175,Monica,"I mean, think about it."
176,Monica,You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want.
177,Monica,"You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm..."
178,Monica,Salmon!
179,Monica,"But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's gonna like you better than me."
180,Monica,"Oh, god... She's told you that already, didn't she?"

194,Phoebe,"So-so, what do you want for lunch?"
195,Rachel,"Oh, I don't know."
196,Rachel,I guess we have to eat.
197,Phoebe,"Yeah, I do."
198,Phoebe,What's the matter?
199,Rachel,I'm just bummed about the way I left things with Ross.
200,Rachel,I shouldn't have lied to him about having to work.
201,Rachel,He seemed so mad at me.
202,Phoebe,"Eh, don't be so hard on yourself."
203,Phoebe,If someone I was still in love with was getting married...
204,Rachel,Still in love with?
205,Phoebe,Yeah!

209,Phoebe,No.
210,Phoebe,Good!
211,Phoebe,"Yeah, me neither."
212,Rachel,"Phoebe, I'm going to Ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable."
213,Rachel,"Not because, I'm still in love with him!"
214,Rachel,"I mean, hey, y'know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y'know?"
215,Rachel,"Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love!"
216,Rachel,"I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross."
217,Rachel,Yeah!
218,Rachel,"But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that I'm still in love with him."
219,Rachel,Y'know?
220,Rachel,"I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him-Ohh!"
221,Rachel,Oh my God!
222,Rachel,Oh my-why didn't you tell me?!
223,Phoebe,We thought you knew!
224,Rachel,We?
225,Phoebe,"Yeah, we all know!"
226,Phoebe,We talk about it all the time!
227,Rachel,You all know?
228,Rachel,Does Ross know?
229,Phoebe,"Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything."
230,Rachel,"Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!"
231,Phoebe,"Well, because we thought you knew!!"
232,Phoebe,It's so obvious!
233,Phoebe,"God, that would be like telling Monica, ""Hey, you like things clean."""
234,Phoebe,"Or, y'know, ""Hey, Joey, you're gay."""
235,Rachel,What?
236,Phoebe,"Oh, please!"
237,Phoebe,She's always got a broom in her hand!
238,Joey,Hey!
239,Joey,The
240,Joey,Check this out?
241,Joey,Huh?
242,Joey,Yeah.
243,Joey,That's the stuff.
244,Joey,What do you think?
245,Chandler,"Well, I don't have to buy that, ""I'm with stupid"" T-shirt anymore."
246,Joey,"Well, I like it."
247,Joey,Here you go.
248,Chandler,"All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you?"
249,Chandler,Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
250,Joey,"Oh, I embarrass you?"
251,Chandler,How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
252,Chandler,The
253,Chandler,Oh really?
254,Chandler,Then how come no one here is wearing them?
255,Chandler,The
256,Chandler,"All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself."
257,Joey,Oh yeah?
258,Joey,If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat?
259,Joey,I choose the hat.
260,Joey,The
261,Joey,Thanks.
262,Chandler,"Okay, wait."
263,Chandler,"All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here."
264,Chandler,I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
265,Joey,How you doin'?
266,Joey,"Joey Tribbiani, America."
267,Ross,Hey!
268,Ross,"I just spoke to your dad, and you know what?"
269,Ross,He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
270,Ross,Whoa-whoa-what?
271,Ross,You found a place?
272,Ross,She said what?
273,Ross,Postpone it?
274,Ross,"Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding?"
275,Ross,"Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?"
276,Ross,This isn't right.
277,Ross,I can't ask people to do that?
278,Ross,Would you ask people to do that?
279,Ross,The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option.
280,Ross,This is when we're getting married.
281,Ross,No.
282,Ross,I'm saying it's now.
283,Ross,There's no 'or' in mind.
284,Ross,What is wrong with these pants?!
285,Ross,"No, wait!"
286,Ross,Emily!
287,Ross,"No, wait, stop!"
288,Ross,"Emily, please- Commercial Break"
289,Phoebe,Hey!
290,Rachel,Hi.
291,Phoebe,"So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?"
292,Rachel,Manhattan does not have enough stores.
293,Phoebe,"Well, I think I can help you get over him."
294,Rachel,You can?
295,Phoebe,Yeah.
296,Phoebe,I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
297,Rachel,Um-hmm.
298,Phoebe,And a small piece of chocolate.
299,Rachel,Okay.
300,Phoebe,And a glass of tepid water.
301,Rachel,"Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?"
302,Phoebe,"Uh, only if you have the hiccups too."
303,Phoebe,"Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me."
304,Phoebe,I just didn't feel like getting up.
305,Phoebe,"Okay, I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross."
306,Phoebe,Okay?
307,Phoebe,And you're going to remember all of the bad things about him.
308,Phoebe,All right?
309,Phoebe,Really focus on his flaws.
310,Rachel,I can do that.
311,Rachel,I certainly did it when we were going out.
312,Phoebe,Okay.
313,Phoebe,"Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he's such a great guy."
314,Phoebe,Here.
315,Phoebe,"Okay, now, close your eyes."
316,Phoebe,And imagine that you're with Ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him.
317,Phoebe,And you're-you're running your hands all over his body.
318,Phoebe,"And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it's-uck!"
319,Phoebe,Hah?
320,Rachel,"I don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy."
321,Phoebe,"Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought."
322,Phoebe,"Umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy."
323,Rachel,Okay.
324,Phoebe,Okay?
325,Rachel,All right.
326,Phoebe,"So uh, now look at the picture..."
327,Rachel,Okay.
328,Phoebe,"All right, and umm..."
329,Rachel,Ow!
330,Phoebe,"Okay, how do you feel now?"
331,Rachel,"Well, I like you less!"
332,Chandler,"Well, this is just as boring in England."
333,Joey,Hey.
334,Chandler,Hey.
335,Joey,Oh.
336,Joey,Sorry!
337,Chandler,"No-no-no, y'know what?"
338,Chandler,"I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool."
339,Chandler,"And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day."
340,Joey,Me too.
341,Chandler,Yeah?
342,Joey,Noo!!
343,Joey,I've had the best day ever!
344,Joey,"Dude, check this out!"
345,Joey,"Now, I'm gonna fastforward past the part with you, 'cause it is boring."
346,Monica,Hey!
347,Joey,Sh-shh-shh!
348,Joey,"Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat."
349,Joey,"Oh, Chandler."
350,Chandler,That's... That's was...
351,Monica,Oh my God!
352,Joey,That's Fergie baby!
353,Joey,"So, I hear you're single now..."
354,Chandler,How did you?
355,Chandler,How?
356,Chandler,How?
357,Joey,"Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right?"
358,Joey,"So, I'm in my map and-and... Hey!"
359,Monica,Hey!
360,Ross,Hi.
361,Ross,I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
362,Monica,"Yes, I did!"
363,Monica,And you are welcome!
364,Ross,Am I?!
365,Ross,And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?
366,Monica,Umm...
367,Chandler,I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
368,Joey,Wait up!
369,Ross,"Hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?"
370,Monica,She said that?
371,Ross,Yeah.
372,Monica,Why?
373,Ross,"I don't know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out."
374,Monica,Oh my God.
375,Monica,You're even dumber than I am!
376,Ross,Excuse me?
377,Monica,"Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?"
378,Ross,I don't know.
379,Ross,A month?
380,Monica,Emily has probably been planning it since she was five!
381,Monica,Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head.
382,Monica,That's what we did!
383,Monica,"We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top."
384,Monica,Thanks.
385,Monica,But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
386,Ross,I had no idea.
387,Ross,"And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun."
388,Monica,Sometimes we were.
389,Ross,Come on.
390,Ross,You gotta help me figure out what to do.
391,Ross,Okay?
392,Monica,Okay.
393,Ross,Come on.
394,Chandler,That was pretty intense huh?
395,Joey,Yeah.
396,Joey,"Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!"
397,Chandler,I hope he did!
398,Phoebe,Ooh!
399,Phoebe,I thought of a good flaw!
400,Phoebe,Ross pops his gum!
401,Rachel,"Oh, right!"
402,Rachel,"Wait a minute, I do that too."
403,Phoebe,"Yeah, I know."
404,Phoebe,It drives me crazy.
405,Phoebe,I'll get it.
406,Phoebe,Hello.
407,Joey,"Hey, Pheebs!"
408,Joey,It's Joey!
409,Phoebe,"Hey, Joey!"
410,Phoebe,Hey!
411,Phoebe,Ooh!
412,Phoebe,Ooh!
413,Phoebe,I just say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway.
414,Phoebe,And I was gonna go over and say 'hi!'
415,Phoebe,"but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you."
416,Joey,That just cost me four bucks.
417,Joey,"But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?"
418,Phoebe,"Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe!"
419,Phoebe,Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all.
420,Phoebe,"So, do you miss me?"
421,Joey,"Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun."
422,Phoebe,So you're not homesick yet?
423,Joey,"No, I don't think so."
424,Phoebe,"All right, the seven of us miss you."
425,Joey,Who's seven?
426,Phoebe,"Y'know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies..."
427,Joey,"Ahh, the babies miss me?"
428,Phoebe,Of course they do!
429,Phoebe,Or I'm just really hungry.
430,Phoebe,"Ooh, the pizza guy's here!"
431,Joey,What?
432,Joey,You ordered pizza without me?
433,Phoebe,Yeah.
434,Phoebe,"But y'know we were thinking about you, y'know we ordered the Joey Special."
435,Joey,Two pizzas?
436,Phoebe,Yep!
437,Phoebe,"Okay, gotta go, talk to you later."
438,Joey,"Wait, well, where did you get it from?"
439,Monica,You'll see.
440,Ross,Okay?
441,Ross,"But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay?"
442,Ross,"And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles..."
443,Monica,"And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay?"
444,Monica,"And the chairs can face this way , and...  You go."
445,Ross,"But-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time."
446,Ross,"Really, it's fine, whatever you want."
447,Ross,"And, I don't know, if it starts to rain..."
448,Monica,Ohh.
449,Monica,And I don't even have a date.
450,Rachel,Pheebs?
451,Phoebe,Yeah?
452,Rachel,Do you remember where the duck food is?
453,Phoebe,"Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink."
454,Phoebe,Why?
455,Rachel,Because I'm going to London.
456,Phoebe,What?!
457,Phoebe,What do you mean you're going to London?
458,Rachel,"Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him."
459,Rachel,"Now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies until I get back."
460,Phoebe,"But what about all the ""finding-his-flaws"" stuff we've been doing?"
461,Rachel,"Yeah, that didn't work."
462,Phoebe,"I-Rachel, you can't go!"
463,Phoebe,Ross loves Emily!
464,Rachel,"Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does."
465,Rachel,But I have to tell him how I feel!
466,Rachel,He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
467,Phoebe,That's not why you're going!
468,Phoebe,"You're going because you hope he's gonna say, ""Yeah, I love you too, Rach."
469,Phoebe,"Forget that British chippy."""
470,Rachel,Ohh-Do you think he will?
471,Phoebe,No!
472,Phoebe,Because he's in love with the British chippy!
473,Phoebe,"Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding!"
474,Phoebe,"Y'know, it's too late!"
475,Phoebe,You missed you're chance!
476,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over."
477,Rachel,Y'know what?
478,Rachel,No.
479,Rachel,"It's not over until someone says, ""I do."""
480,Phoebe,I do!
481,Phoebe,I do!
482,Phoebe,I do!

495,Phoebe,"No no no, I'll be nice, I swear!!!"
496,Phoebe,Could you just give me the number for where they are?
497,Phoebe,"Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay."
498,Phoebe,"And I have to warn somebody, alright."
499,Phoebe,So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.

678,Monica,Well...I'd better get going.
679,Chandler,"Oh yea yea, absolutely."
680,Monica,Could you not look?
681,Chandler,I don't want to look.
682,Joey,Hello?
683,Phoebe,"Hey, were the hell have you been?"
684,Joey,Hey.
685,Joey,I spent the night out.
686,Joey,I met this cute bridesmaid.
687,Joey,She is so...
688,Phoebe,I don't want to hear about her!
689,Joey,"Ahh Pheebs, you know you're still my number one girl."
690,Phoebe,No!
691,Phoebe,"No, we have an emergency."
692,Phoebe,Okay?
693,Phoebe,Rachel's coming to London.
694,Joey,Ohh great!!
695,Phoebe,No it's not great.
696,Phoebe,"No, she's coming to tell Ross that she loves him."
697,Joey,"But, he loves Emily?"
698,Phoebe,I KNOW THAT!!!
699,Phoebe,You have to stop her!!
700,Phoebe,She's going to ruin the wedding!
701,Joey,Okay.
702,Phoebe,"All right, so, okay..."
703,Joey,Hold on.
704,Joey,Hold on.
705,Joey,Rachel coming.
706,Joey,Do...Something.
707,Phoebe,"Okay, so I'm done my part, okay."
708,Phoebe,"It's your responsibility now, okay."
709,Phoebe,"The burden is off me, right?"
710,Joey,Right!
711,Phoebe,So tell me about this girl?
712,Rachel,...And so then I realised.
713,Rachel,All this stuff I had been doing.
714,Rachel,"proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn't come to the wedding."
715,Rachel,Was all just a way of...
716,Rachel,"Ehh, pardon me?"
717,Rachel,But he has to know how I feel!
718,Rachel,Well I-I think your wrong.
719,Rachel,"Well, he doesn't really love her."
720,Rachel,"I mean, it's just a rebound thing from me.... You'll see!"
721,Joey,Do something..... Something....
722,Joey,Hey.
723,Chandler,Hey.
724,Joey,Have you seen Monica?
725,Chandler,I'm not seeing Monica.

736,Chandler,Okay!!
737,Chandler,What's with the third degree?!
738,Chandler,Why don't you just shine a light in my eyes?
739,Monica,"Well, I love it."

743,Joey,"Pisst, Monica."
744,Joey,"Alright, we really need to start looking out for Rachel."
745,Joey,I'll cover the front door.
746,Joey,You watch that big hole at the back of the building and I got Chandler covering Ross.
747,Monica,Why would I care where Chandler is?
748,Monica,You know uhh...You know sometimes I don't even like Chandler.

804,Phoebe,Oh that's so great!
805,Phoebe,"Ohh, so what's going on now?"
806,Joey,"Ah, I'm-I'm walking down the aisle...Still walking."
807,Joey,I'm about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night.
808,Joey,Hey!
809,Joey,"I told her ""Hey."""
810,Joey,And now I'm at the front with Ross.
811,Joey,It's Phoebe.
812,Joey,He looks pretty mad.
813,Joey,Uh...I'd better go.
814,Phoebe,No!!
815,Phoebe,"wait, wait, wait!!"
816,Phoebe,"Oh please, hold it up so I can listen."
817,Chandler,What we did last night was....
818,Monica,Stupid.
819,Chandler,Totally crazy stupid.
820,Monica,What were we thinking?
821,Chandler,"I'm coming over tonight though, right?"
822,Monica,Oh yeah.
823,Monica,Definitely.
824,Ross,I Ross...
825,Ross,"Take thee, Rachel... Emily."
826,Ross,Emily.
827,Rachel,"He-he said Rachel, right?"
828,Rachel,Do you think I should go up there?
829,Ross,"I, Ross..."
830,Ross,"Take thee,  Emily."
831,Ross,Like there'd be anybody else.
832,Ross,"As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us."
833,Ross,"Really, I do."
834,Ross,Emily.
835,Ross,Happy to.
836,Ross,Yay!
837,Ross,Okay.
838,Joey,"Well, that went well."
839,Joey,Yeah.
840,Chandler,"It could've been worse, he could've shot her."
841,Ross,"That uh, that was pretty funny."
842,Ross,Wasn't it?
843,Ross,Commercial Break
844,Joey,"Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?"
845,Ross,"That-that-that's all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie."
846,Ross,I'll be right out here.
847,Ross,She's just fixing her makeup.
848,Ross,"And, I love you!!"
849,Ross,Mr.
850,Ross,"That's true, thanks dad."
851,Ross,People should be dancing!
852,Ross,Huh?
853,Ross,"Hey, this is a party!"
854,Ross,Come on!
855,Ross,"Joey, dance!!"
856,Ross,Mrs.
857,Phoebe,"Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange."
858,Phoebe,Mrs.
859,Phoebe,"Yeah, I've discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women's names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own."
860,Phoebe,Mrs.
861,Phoebe,"No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange."
862,Phoebe,Oh no!
863,Phoebe,You have it too!
864,Phoebe,Hello?
865,Phoebe,What kind of bitch hangs up on a doctor!
866,Chandler,Hey.
867,Monica,Hey.
868,Chandler,"Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship."
869,Monica,I know.
870,Monica,How could we have let this happen?
871,Chandler,Seven times!
872,Monica,Ugh!
873,Monica,"Well, y'know, we were away..."
874,Chandler,"In a foreign, romantic country..."
875,Monica,I blame London.
876,Chandler,Bad London!
877,Monica,"So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?"
878,Chandler,"Well, I don't see that we have a choice."
879,Chandler,"But, when we're back home, we don't do it."
880,Monica,Only here.
881,Chandler,"Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs..."
882,Monica,I'll meet you there in two minutes.
883,Chandler,Okay!
884,Rachel,"Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something."
885,Monica,Now?
886,Rachel,"Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?"
887,Monica,"Oh, I-I don't know."
888,Rachel,"Monica, what should I do?"
889,Monica,"Just uh, do the right thing."
890,Rachel,What?
891,Monica,Toe the line.
892,Monica,Thread the needle.
893,Monica,Think outside the box!
894,Rachel,"Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant."
895,Monica,Wait.
896,Monica,"Rachel, no, he's married."
897,Monica,Married!
898,Monica,"If you don't realise that, I can't help you."
899,Rachel,"Okay, you're right."
900,Rachel,You're right.
901,Rachel,You can't help me.
902,Rachel,Mrs.
903,Joey,"Hey, what's up?"
904,Joey,"You and me, next dance?"
905,Joey,Mrs.
906,Rachel,Yes?
907,Rachel,Mrs.
908,Rachel,"Oh, you know what?"
909,Rachel,Rachel.. She just left.
910,Rachel,Mrs.
911,Rachel,Ra.... Er.. Barbra.
912,Rachel,Mrs.
913,Rachel,Yeah.
914,Monica,Where were you?
915,Monica,We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
916,Chandler,"Forget it, that's off."
917,Monica,Why?!
918,Monica,Mr.
919,Monica,"Joey, what are you doing?"
920,Monica,You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
921,Joey,"Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count."
922,Monica,That's true.
923,Chandler,The man's got a point.
924,Rachel,"Oh, hi!"
925,Ross,Hi!
926,Rachel,Hi.
927,Rachel,"Sorry, things aren't working out so well."
928,Ross,Oh no!
929,Ross,"It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right?"
930,Rachel,Oh yeah!
931,Rachel,"Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know?"
932,Rachel,"I mean, so you said my name!"
933,Rachel,"Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, ""I take thee circus freak."""
934,Rachel,"Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake."
935,Rachel,It didn't mean anything.
936,Rachel,Right?
937,Ross,No!
938,Ross,No!
939,Ross,Of course it didn't mean anything!
940,Ross,"I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you..."
941,Rachel,Right...
942,Ross,But it absolutely didn't.
943,Ross,It didn't!!
944,Ross,It didn't!
945,Joey,"Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so..."
946,Ross,Oh!
947,Ross,"Oh-oh, the band's ready!"
948,Ross,"Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says-I don't care about the stupid band!"
949,Joey,You spit on me man!
950,Ross,"Look, I'm sorry."
951,Joey,"Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?"
952,Rachel,"Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame."
953,Ross,"Oh, right!"
954,Rachel,"Get the hell out of there, y'know?"
955,Ross,Emily?
956,Ross,Emily?
957,Ross,I'm coming in.
958,Rachel,"Well, look at that, same thing."
959,Chandler,"Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, ""Yippee!"""
960,Chandler,just ignore me.
961,Monica,"Oh my God, Rachel!"
962,Monica,Hi!
963,Chandler,"Oh, hello Rachel."
964,Rachel,Ross said my name.
965,Rachel,Okay?
966,Rachel,My name.
967,Monica,How did you get in here?
968,Rachel,"If anybody asks, I'm your sister, Joan."
969,Rachel,Listen.
970,Rachel,"C'mon, you guys."
971,Rachel,Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!
972,Chandler,Your sister Joan is crazy.
973,Rachel,Y'know what?
974,Rachel,"Fine, I don't care."
975,Rachel,"Don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?"
976,Chandler,"Yes, we do."
977,Chandler,"But, we have to change first."
978,Monica,"Yes, I want to change."
979,Monica,And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
980,Chandler,"Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes."
981,Monica,Fifteen minutes.
982,Rachel,Okay.
983,Rachel,Hello?
984,Rachel,"Oh, Pheebs!"
985,Rachel,It's Phoebe!
986,Chandler,"Oh, yay..."
987,Monica,Great...
988,Rachel,Hi!
989,Phoebe,"Hi, so what happened?"
990,Rachel,"Well, Ross said my name."
991,Phoebe,"Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything."
992,Rachel,"Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right?"
993,Rachel,"Ninth grade, right?"
994,Rachel,The obsession starts.
995,Rachel,All right?
996,Rachel,"The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow."
997,Rachel,So then...
998,Chandler,"Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?"
999,Monica,But my clothes are-ohh!
1000,Chandler,"Wow, you look..."
1001,Monica,No time for that!
1002,Joey,"Hey, dude, let me in."
1003,Joey,I got a girl out here!
1004,Chandler,"Well, I've got a girl in here."
1005,Joey,"No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!"
1006,Chandler,"Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!"
1007,Joey,"Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?"
1008,Chandler,"Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!!"
1009,Chandler,"But, what if we're watching a movie in here?"
1010,Monica,"Which we are, and-and we already paid for it."
1011,Monica,It's My Giant!
1012,Joey,My Giant?
1013,Joey,I love that movie!
1014,Monica,You really think this is okay?
1015,Chandler,"Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it."
1016,Monica,"Oh, it's so beautiful."
1017,Monica,Ohh!
1018,Monica,"Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this."
1019,Chandler,"Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite."
1020,Chandler,The room expects sex.
1021,Chandler,The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex.
1022,Chandler,All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
1023,Monica,Okay!
1024,Chandler,Okay!
1025,Ross,Emily?
1026,Chandler,"Nope, not under here!"
1027,Monica,You didn't find her?
1028,Ross,"No, I've looked everywhere!"
1029,Chandler,"Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!"
1030,Monica,"Yeah, I think you should keep looking!"
1031,Chandler,"Yeah, for about 30 minutes."
1032,Monica,Or 45.
1033,Chandler,"Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice."
1034,Ross,No!
1035,Ross,"For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around."
1036,Ross,"No, from now on, I'm staying in one place."
1037,Ross,Right here.
1038,Monica,"Well, it's getting late."
1039,Chandler,"Yeah, we're gonna go."
1040,Ross,"Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?"
1041,Monica,"Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York."
1042,Chandler,"Yeah, it's a very large plane."
1043,Ross,That's cool.
1044,Chandler,"But, we'll stay here with you."
1045,Ross,Thanks guys!
1046,Ross,"I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt."
1047,Ross,Commercial Break
1048,Chandler,We have to leave for New York in an hour.
1049,Monica,"I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?"
1050,Chandler,We can't do that that's insane.
1051,Chandler,"I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it."
1052,Ross,Em-Emily?
1053,Ross,Em-Emily?
1054,Ross,Emily!
1055,Ross,Mr.
1056,Ross,"Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?"
1057,Ross,Mr.
1058,Rachel,"Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside...   Mr."
1059,Ross,"Now, hold on!"
1060,Ross,Hold on!
1061,Ross,"Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too!"
1062,Ross,"Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay?"
1063,Ross,She's-she's just a friend and that's all!
1064,Ross,That's all!
1065,Ross,Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else.
1066,Ross,"Please, promise me that you'll tell her that."
1067,Ross,Mr.
1068,Monica,"Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again."
1069,Chandler,"Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special."
1070,Chandler,"Y'know, technically we still are over international waters."
1071,Monica,"I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?"
1072,Chandler,'Kay!
1073,Joey,Can I ask you something?
1074,Chandler,"Uhh, no."
1075,Joey,"Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, ""I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant."""
1076,Joey,Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
1077,Chandler,No.
1078,Joey,"I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?"
1079,Chandler,Yes.
1080,Joey,Thanks man.
1081,Chandler,Okay man.
1082,Joey,But what about how much taller he is than me?
1083,Joey,"I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know?"
1084,Joey,"And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?"
1085,Joey,"Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour."
1086,Monica,I know!
1087,Joey,"Had the beef-tips, huh?"
1088,Ross,Rach!
1089,Ross,Rach!
1090,Rachel,Hi!
1091,Ross,Hi!
1092,Ross,"What are you, what are you doing here?"
1093,Rachel,"Well, I-I-I've been on Standby for a flight home for hours."
1094,Ross,Oh.
1095,Rachel,"Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?"
1096,Ross,Not yet.
1097,Rachel,"So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?"
1098,Rachel,Gate
1099,Ross,Pretty soon I guess.
1100,Rachel,Yeah.
1101,Rachel,I'm sorry.
1102,Ross,"I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this?"
1103,Ross,"Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?"
1104,Rachel,"No, you're not an idiot, Ross."
1105,Rachel,You're a guy very much in love.
1106,Ross,Same difference.
1107,Ross,Gate
1108,Ross,I get it!
1109,Ross,"Well, that's that."
1110,Rachel,"No, you know what, I think you should go."
1111,Ross,What?
1112,Rachel,"Yeah, I do."
1113,Rachel,"I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good."
1114,Ross,"Oh, I don't, I don't, I don't know..."
1115,Rachel,"Oh, come on Ross!"
1116,Rachel,I think it would be really good for you!
1117,Ross,"I could, yeah, I can do that."
1118,Rachel,Yeah.
1119,Ross,"I can't, I can't even believe her!"
1120,Ross,"No, y'know what, I am, I am gonna go!"
1121,Rachel,Good!
1122,Ross,"I know, why not?"
1123,Rachel,Right!
1124,Ross,Right?
1125,Rachel,Right!
1126,Ross,Y'know-thanks!
1127,Rachel,"Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here."
1128,Ross,"Yeah, well...nah."
1129,Rachel,What?
1130,Rachel,"Wait, what?"
1131,Ross,"Why don't you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?"
1132,Rachel,"Well-well, I don't know Ross-really?"
1133,Ross,"Yeah, yeah, it'll be great!"
1134,Ross,"You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage."
1135,Ross,See-see how I make jokes?
1136,Rachel,Uh-huh.
1137,Ross,"No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend."
1138,Rachel,"Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe."
1139,Rachel,"Umm, yes, I can do that!"
1140,Ross,Okay!
1141,Rachel,Okay!
1142,Ross,Cool!
1143,Rachel,All right!
1144,Ross,Come on!
1145,Ross,Here.
1146,Rachel,"Oh, okay, we're going."
1147,Rachel,Yeah.
1148,Ross,Ah!
1149,Ross,Ah!
1150,Ross,I forgot my jacket!

1182,Phoebe,"I know you didn't, I was talking about Monica."
1183,Monica,"Phoebe, I did not have sex."
1184,Phoebe,This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
1185,Joey,"All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck."
1186,Phoebe,"Oh, me too!"
1187,Joey,"Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?"
1188,Phoebe,"Oh right, maybe I'll just go home."
1189,Monica,"Well, we certainly are alone."
1190,Chandler,Yes!
1191,Chandler,"Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule."
1192,Monica,Right.
1193,Monica,"Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother..."
1194,Chandler,Right.
1195,Monica,"Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks."
1196,Chandler,Oh.
1197,Chandler,"Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot!"
1198,Chandler,Is that okay?
1199,Monica,That's okay.
1200,Chandler,And I'm cute too.
1201,Monica,And you're cute too.
1202,Chandler,Thank you!
1203,Chandler,"All right, I gotta go unpack."
1204,Monica,Okay.
1205,Chandler,Bye.

1207,Monica,That counts!
1208,Chandler,"Oh, good!"
1209,Chandler,End
0,Monica,"Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor."
1,Rachel,Oh my God!
2,Rachel,This is it!
3,Rachel,I really hope it's you!
4,Phoebe,I hope it's you.
5,Rachel,Me too!
6,Monica,"First of all um, I love you both so much and you're both so important to me"
7,Rachel,"Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!!"
8,Rachel,Who is it?
9,Monica,"Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other."
10,Monica,"Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine"
11,Phoebe,Yes!!!
12,Phoebe,Oh!
13,Rachel,Hypothetically!
14,Phoebe,Still.
15,Monica,If Phoebe were my maid of honor
16,Rachel,Uh-hmm.
17,Monica,"Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset."
18,Rachel,Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea.
19,Phoebe,"Yeah, I'll do that."
20,Phoebe,So who gets to be yours?
21,Monica,Well that's the best part.
22,Monica,"Umm, you guys get to decide!"
23,Phoebe,Wh-why is that the best part?
24,Monica,Because then I don't have to!
25,Rachel,Well of course we will help you decide!
26,Rachel,We will do anything we can to help you!
27,Rachel,"Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that"
28,Monica,I'm really not deciding!
29,Rachel,Fine!
30,Monica,Yeah that's right.

51,Chandler,"No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch."
52,Joey,What are you talking about?
53,Joey,Bitch.
54,Phoebe,Hey Rachel?
55,Rachel,Yeah?
56,Phoebe,"Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?"

58,Phoebe,Uh-hmm.
59,Rachel,Oh my God Phoebe!
60,Rachel,I mean I'm justWait a minute.

64,Rachel,Ohh!
65,Rachel,No way Phoebe!
66,Rachel,I want to be Monica's!

68,Rachel,Why does it matter so much to you?
69,Phoebe,Because this one is now!
70,Phoebe,And-and it's two of our best friends!
71,Phoebe,Who knows what you're gonna marry!
72,Rachel,What-what if I marry RossOr Joey?
73,Phoebe,You wouldn't!
74,Phoebe,"Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I've never been maid of honor to anyone before!"
75,Phoebe,And I know you've done it at least twice!
76,Rachel,Yeah but Phoebe
77,Phoebe,"And no, oh please, oh please let me finish."
78,Phoebe,Oh I guess that was it.
79,Rachel,Okay.
80,Rachel,Okay.
81,Rachel,It'ssince you've never done it before you can be Monica's made of honor.
82,Phoebe,"Oh, thank you so much!"
83,Phoebe,Okay.
84,Rachel,I'm gonna marry someone good y'know.
85,Phoebe,Oh I know.

107,Monica,This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then sheshe wished me good luck.
108,Chandler,That's sweet.
109,Monica,"No, it's more like a  good luck."
110,Chandler,"So uh, what did this woman look like?"
111,Monica,"She was like 30, dark hair, attractive."
112,Chandler,"Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?"
113,Monica,"Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?"
114,Chandler,"No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive  Hold on one second; let me check this out."
115,Chandler,(He gets up and grabs a photo album.
116,Monica,What are you doing?
117,Chandler,"Well, let's see  Okay uh, is that her?"
118,Monica,Oh my God yes!
119,Monica,Who is she?
120,Chandler,"Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend."
121,Monica,Did you break up with her?
122,Chandler,"No, we're still together."
123,Chandler,"Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her."
124,Monica,Why?
125,Chandler,"Well, cause she came back the third summer and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow"
126,Monica,Fat?
127,Chandler,I did not say fat!

141,Rachel,You have been maid of honor before?!
142,Phoebe,See?
143,Phoebe,This is exactly why you shouldn't lie!
144,Rachel,All right that's it!
145,Rachel,I am maid of honor!
146,Phoebe,"Na-uh, I am!"
147,Rachel,How come you are?
148,Phoebe,Because I cared enough to lie!
149,Joey,"Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it!"
150,Joey,"Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you'd handle maid of honor type situations."
151,Phoebe,What are you talking about?
152,Joey,"Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see, they give me the part."
153,Phoebe,"Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?"
154,Joey,"Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges."
155,Phoebe,"Well, it's better than us deciding."
156,Rachel,"Oh, come on!"
157,Rachel,This is crazy!
158,Rachel,Can't we just flip a coin?
159,Phoebe,No!
160,Phoebe,Coins hate me!
161,Rachel,Okay.
162,Rachel,"Okay fine, y'know what?"
163,Rachel,We will let Ross and Joey decide.
164,Rachel,"Hiiiii, Ross!"

175,Ross,I I don't know what you are talking about.
176,Joey,Come on!
177,Joey,Admit it!
178,Joey,That was the best nap you ever had!
179,Ross,I've had better.
180,Joey,Okay!
181,Joey,When?
182,Ross,All right!
183,Ross,All right!
184,Ross,It was the best nap ever!
185,Joey,Uh-huh!
186,Ross,I've said it!
187,Ross,Okay?!
188,Ross,But it's over Joey!
189,Joey,I want to do it again.
190,Ross,We can't do it again.
191,Joey,Why not?
192,Ross,Because it's weird!
193,Joey,Fine!
194,Joey,Do you want something to drink?
195,Ross,"Sure, what do you got?"
196,Joey,Warm milk and Excedrin P.M.  Commercial Break
197,Monica,Chandler!
198,Monica,Chandler!
199,Monica,I just figured out who you are!
200,Chandler,Can you figure out what I'm doing?
201,Monica,You're Lewis Posin.
202,Chandler,Who?
203,Monica,Lewis Posin!
204,Monica,"He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no."
205,Monica,Do you know why?
206,Chandler,Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?
207,Monica,No!
208,Monica,But because he thought I was to faaaaa.
209,Monica,"And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade!"
210,Monica,"Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie."
211,Chandler,What?
212,Chandler,Are you kidding?
213,Chandler,That was like 16 years ago.
214,Monica,"No, I know."
215,Monica,But y'know what?
216,Monica,It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
217,Chandler,"Okay, I will do it."
218,Chandler,But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
219,Joey,"Okay, all right, this is how it's going to work."
220,Joey,"We're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest."
221,Ross,"No, 10 is the highest."
222,Joey,Why is 10 the highest?
223,Ross,Because it's the highest.
224,Ross,"Okay, Rachel you're up first."
225,Ross,Situation No.
226,Joey,I don't want to marry Chandler!
227,Rachel,"Okay, uh"
228,Joey,I've got cold feet.
229,Rachel,it's gonna be okay!
230,Joey,"No, one man for the rest of my life?"
231,Joey,I don't know if I can do it!
232,Joey,This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey!
233,Rachel,"Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common."
234,Rachel,"Y'know, it's-it's just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler."
235,Rachel,"And also, I ran out on a wedding."
236,Rachel,You don't get to keep the gifts.
237,Joey,Very good!
238,Joey,"Drawing on your own experience, I like that!"
239,Rachel,Thanks!
240,Ross,"Yes, very nice Rachel."
241,Rachel,Thank you judges.
242,Phoebe,"Ugh, what a kiss ass."
243,Rachel,Oh!
244,Joey,"Okay, Phoebe"
245,Phoebe,Yes!
246,Phoebe,Your honor?
247,Joey,"We're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, ""I do"" when her drunk uncle starts yelling."
248,Joey,What do you do?
249,Joey,Go!
250,Ross,"When Monica was a little girl, I remember thatOoh!!"
251,Ross,Ow!
252,Ross,Very good!
253,Phoebe,Oh!
254,Joey,Yes!
255,Joey,Excellent!
256,Joey,Perfect score!
257,Rachel,Wait a minute!
258,Rachel,She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
259,Phoebe,Hey!
260,Phoebe,Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?
261,Ross,It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
262,Rachel,"Ohh, wait a minute, we haven't pre"
263,Ross,Go!
264,Rachel,Okay!
265,Rachel,Okay!
266,Rachel,"Umm, Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as  Okay!!"
267,Rachel,Forget that!
268,Rachel,That sucks!!
269,Rachel,"Okay, never mind!"
270,Rachel,Forget it!
271,Rachel,"Umm, umm, okay, uh I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old."
272,Rachel,Ross and
273,Joey,Oh!
274,Joey,That's nice.
275,Rachel,Thank you.
276,Rachel,Thank you very much.
277,Rachel,"Umm, I've known them separately and I've known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love."
278,Rachel,So I would like to raise my glass  to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together.
279,Rachel,I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
280,Joey,Wow.
281,Joey,Good speech.
282,Ross,"Yeah, it really was!"
283,Rachel,"Aw, thanks!"
284,Ross,"Okay Phoebe, I guess you're next  although I really don't see the point."
285,Joey,Yeah.
286,Phoebe,"Okay, I can't believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married."
287,Phoebe,"I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked."
288,Joey,And she's back in the game.
289,Chandler,Julie hi!
290,Chandler,"Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me."
291,Chandler,"It's a nickname, I'll explain later."
292,Monica,It's pretty clear.
293,Chandler,"Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology."
294,Chandler,I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
295,Chandler,You-you-you didn't know that.
296,Chandler,"Well, I guess my work here is done!"
297,Joey,"All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well."
298,Joey,Okay?
299,Joey,You should be proud of yourselves.
300,Joey,And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers.
301,Joey,"Well, except for RachelDamnit!"
302,Phoebe,Really?!
303,Phoebe,I won!
304,Rachel,What?
305,Ross,"I'm sorry Rach, it was, it was really close."
306,Rachel,Well then I demand a recount!
307,Ross,"Actually, it wasn't that close."
308,Rachel,No!
309,Rachel,Y'know what?
310,Rachel,No!
311,Rachel,No!
312,Rachel,"You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculousWe're gonna flip a coin!"
313,Rachel,All right?!
314,Rachel,Heads!
315,Phoebe,The coins have finally forgiven me!
316,Rachel,Well y'know what?
317,Rachel,"I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower!"
318,Phoebe,"Rach, it's gonna be okay!"
319,Phoebe,You guys are the best!
320,Joey,"Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me."
321,Ross,Yeah?
322,Joey,Yeah!
323,Joey,I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
324,Ross,Why-why would I care about that?
325,Joey,"No reason, I'm just saying that uh That's where I'll be."
326,Chandler,As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself.
327,Chandler,I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
328,Monica,Why don't you just stop doing stupid things?
329,Monica,Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
330,Chandler,I would really love it if could do both.
331,Monica,"All right, II have to ask."
332,Chandler,What?
333,Monica,Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
334,Chandler,What?
335,Monica,"Well, you broke up with Julie Grath!"
336,Monica,How much weight could she have gained?
337,Chandler,A hundred and forty-five pounds.
338,Monica,In one year?!
339,Monica,My God what did she eat?
340,Monica,Her-her family!
341,Monica,That's not the point.
342,Chandler,"Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!"
343,Monica,Well That's not the only time this was an issue.
344,Monica,"You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us?"
345,Monica,You called me fat.
346,Chandler,Okay.
347,Chandler,"Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different."
348,Monica,How?
349,Chandler,You were not supposed to hear that!
350,Chandler,I said that behind you back!
351,Monica,"What if I have babies, okay?"
352,Monica,I mean I'm gonna look different.
353,Monica,"I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!"
354,Chandler,"Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman."
355,Chandler,See this is one of things that I can apologize for later!
356,Chandler,"Look, what I mean is you're Monica!"
357,Chandler,Okay?
358,Chandler,And I am in love with Monica.
359,Monica,Keep going.
360,Chandler,So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
361,Monica,Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
362,Chandler,I'd carry you around in my pocket.
363,Monica,I love you.
364,Chandler,Skidmark's still got a way with the ladies.
365,Rachel,Hi Pheebs.
366,Phoebe,Hi!
367,Rachel,Hi!
368,Rachel,I just want to apologize.
369,Rachel,I'm really sorry I was a baby.
370,Phoebe,"That's ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once."
371,Phoebe,"Oh, you mean today."
372,Rachel,Yeah.
373,Rachel,"Yeah, and y'know you-you deserve to win."
374,Rachel,"And-and y'know I was thinking about it, if-if you're Monica's maid of honor that means I get to be yours."
375,Phoebe,Oh yeah!
376,Rachel,Yeah!
377,Rachel,"Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y'know just in case"
378,Phoebe,Oh that's so sweet thanks.
379,Rachel,Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves.
380,Rachel,"And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride."
381,Rachel,"And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman."
382,Rachel,Oh and here's a little purse that I found.
383,Rachel,Y'know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
384,Phoebe,Ohh.
385,Rachel,"And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y'know cause, people cry at weddings."
386,Rachel,I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.
387,Phoebe,This stuff is great!
388,Rachel,"Oh, I forgot this was in here."
389,Rachel,"Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica's something borrowed and it's blue."
390,Rachel,Yeah
391,Phoebe,"Y'know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica's made of honor."
392,Rachel,You do?
393,Rachel,Why?
394,Phoebe,Because I think it means more to you.
395,Rachel,"But Pheebs, y'know you earned it."
396,Phoebe,Its fine.
397,Phoebe,"I mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14?"
398,Rachel,"No, I was ten."
399,Rachel,I just developed early.
400,Phoebe,Man alive!
401,Monica,"Hey, what's going on?"
402,Rachel,Hey!
403,Phoebe,"Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor."
404,Monica,"Ohh, wow!"
405,Monica,That's great!
406,Monica,Oh wow!
407,Monica,We really have to start planning!
408,Monica,"I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas!"
409,Monica,We should probably get together like four times per week.

9,Rachel,What-what?!
10,Rachel,You're gonna leave this person with me?
11,Joey,"YeahHey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl."
12,Joey,"And hey listen, could you do me a favor?"
13,Joey,When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
14,Rachel,Why?!
15,Rachel,What?!
16,Rachel,Are you kidding?
17,Joey,"Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork."
18,Joey,"Tell her uh, I'm a lonerNo!"
19,Joey,An outlaw!
20,Joey,Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
21,Rachel,Y'know what?
22,Rachel,"That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?"
23,Joey,"Hey, I'm gonna call her later!"
24,Joey,Honest!
25,Joey,"Oh come on, Chandler used to do it!"
26,Joey,He'd even make the girl pancakes!
27,Joey,"Plus, he'd make extras and leave em for me."
28,Rachel,"Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything."
29,Rachel,That is not my responsibility.

45,Ross,My doctoral dissertation!
46,Ross,It's here!
47,Ross,"Yeah, it's right-it's right down here!"
48,Ross,In the biggest library in the university!
49,Chandler,Wow that's actually pretty cool.
50,Ross,"Oh umm, there's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina."
51,Ross,What is that?
52,Chandler,Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
53,Chandler,Female

86,Chandler,I can't wait to read your book Ross!
87,Monica,Come on!
88,Monica,So she comes to the wedding!
89,Monica,I mean it won't be so bad.
90,Chandler,What do you think she's just gonna sit there quietly?
91,Chandler,You don't think she's gonna want to make a toast?
92,Chandler,You don't think she's gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?
93,Monica,"Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?"
94,Chandler,Y'know what?
95,Chandler,It's gonna be okay.
96,Chandler,Y'know what?
97,Chandler,She's probably not gonna even want to come.
98,Monica,Really?
99,Chandler,No!
100,Chandler,That was a lie!
101,Chandler,See how easy that was?
102,Monica,So-so you would've just lied?
103,Chandler,Yes!
104,Monica,Would it really have been that easy?
105,Chandler,Yes!!

144,Joey,"Look you guys, she's a very nice girl."
145,Joey,Okay?
146,Joey,"We had a good time, but I justI don't see it going anywhere."
147,Phoebe,"Yeah, but you always say that."
148,Rachel,"Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere."
149,Joey,"Look I'm sorry you guys, I-I just don't think so."
150,Phoebe,Whatever.
151,Rachel,Fine.
152,Joey,"Hey, don't start judging me!"
153,Joey,Huh?
154,Joey,You're the one who's in love with her assistant!
155,Joey,Huh?
156,Joey,"And you, you're the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!"
157,Rachel,Phoebe!
158,Phoebe,Secret affair!
159,Ross,People are doing it in front of my book!
160,Rachel,I'm sorry?
161,Ross,"My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin' babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!"
162,Rachel,Oh my God!
163,Rachel,Did you get to see anything good?
164,Ross,"Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around."
165,Rachel,"Yeah, there was."
166,Rachel,"It wasthere the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever readYes, there was."
167,Ross,Great!
168,Ross,"Because people kept showing up, I think it's like uh-a thing!"
169,Joey,"Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?"
170,Ross,Oh for cryin' out loud!
171,Joey,"All right, so we should go catch our movie."

204,Ross,No!
205,Ross,Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
206,Ross,The Head
207,Ross,"Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section?"
208,Ross,"See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it."
209,Ross,The Head
210,Ross,"Well, fine."
211,Ross,Fine!
212,Ross,"If-if I'm the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I'll go up there and defend it myself!"
213,Ross,And don't you follow me!
214,Joey,Hey.
215,Phoebe,Hey!
216,Rachel,How did it go with Erin?
217,Joey,"Oh, unbelievable!"
218,Joey,We had the best time!
219,Phoebe,Yay!!
220,Phoebe,"Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore?"
221,Joey,No!
222,Joey,No!
223,Joey,No!
224,Joey,You guys were totally right!
225,Joey,This is so much better than the first time we went out.
226,Joey,Y'know?
227,Joey,"That was so awkward, we were really nervous."
228,Phoebe,Didn't you sleep together?
229,Joey,Yeah that really calms me down.
230,Joey,And!
231,Joey,We have so much in common!
232,Joey,"She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that's a"
233,Rachel,Oh my God!
234,Rachel,Listen to you talkin' about having kids.
235,Rachel,Oh my Joey.
236,Rachel,"Oh, please don't get married before I do."
237,Joey,Okay.
238,Monica,He might still show up.
239,Monica,Is that all?
240,Chandler,"Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding."
241,Chandler,"Um, it's going to be a small ceremony."
242,Chandler,"Uh, tiny!"
243,Chandler,We're not even sure why we're having it.
244,Monica,It's actually going to be just family.
245,Joey,How can you say that?!
246,Joey,The Mets have no closer!
247,Joey,What about Game 1 of the Series?
248,Joey,You shut up!
249,Joey,I love arguing with her.
250,Joey,I'll be right back.
251,Rachel,So how's it goin' with Joey?
252,Rachel,Okay?
253,Rachel,"Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please?"
254,Rachel,I mean tell me that you like him.
255,Rachel,But you said that you liked him!
256,Rachel,I mean what happened?!
257,Rachel,Did ya just change your mind?
258,Phoebe,Then change it back!
259,Phoebe,No spark?
260,Phoebe,Didn't you sleep together?
261,Rachel,"Ugh, tramp!"
262,Phoebe,Does Joey have any idea?
263,Phoebe,"Yeah, you mean like that you're kind of a loner."
264,Phoebe,"Yeah, and maybe that you're a real"
265,Phoebe,"Oh well, I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak."
266,Joey,Hey!
267,Joey,You wanna go?
268,Joey,Okay.
269,Joey,See you guys later.
270,Rachel,"Yeah, see ya."
271,Joey,"Hey, thank you so much."
272,Rachel,Wow.
273,Rachel,"Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here."
274,Phoebe,"No, just a regular old flying dwarf."
275,Ross,Yes?
276,Ross,Yes?!
277,Ross,How can I help you?
278,Ross,"Oh-oh, you're-you're fellow scholars."
279,Ross,"What exactly were you looking for, hmm?"
280,Ross,"Perhaps,  perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings on the Smiledon Californicus?"
281,Ross,Ah AhGet out of here!
282,Ross,"Uh, meeting someone?"
283,Ross,Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion's views on evolution?
284,Ross,I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
285,Ross,"I'm a professor here uh, RossGeller."
286,Ross,Yes!
287,Ross,You're the person who checked out my book?
288,Ross,"Well I uh, I skipped forth grade."
289,Ross,I am veryvery sorry.
290,Joey,Hey!
291,Phoebe,Hey!
292,Rachel,Hi!
293,Phoebe,"So how was, how was your date?"
294,Joey,"Oh, it was great!"
295,Joey,I mean we walked all around the village.
296,Joey,"We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still And guess what, I'm thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts."
297,Phoebe,Oh really?
298,Phoebe,She said she wants to go away with you?
299,Joey,No-no-no-no-no!
300,Joey,"It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while."
301,Joey,Phoebe and
302,Rachel,"Oh no, yeah."
303,Rachel,"Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay?"
304,Rachel,"Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she's not lookin' for a serious relationship."
305,Joey,Where are you gettin' this?
306,Rachel,"Well, she told me."
307,Rachel,She said she's kinda a loner.
308,Joey,Oh.
309,Joey,Oh.
310,Rachel,Joey
311,Joey,"No hey Rach, it's cool okay?"
312,Joey,Y'know I'm a loner too!
313,Joey,Right?
314,Phoebe,"Hey Joey, y'know what?"
315,Phoebe,You are way to good for her.
316,Rachel,Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell em you're not looking for a relationship.
317,Joey,No!
318,Joey,No.
319,Joey,"Don't do that, just next time make sure she really likes me."
320,Rachel,Well that too.
321,Rachel,Joey?
322,Joey,Yeah?
323,Rachel,Do you want some pancakes?
324,Joey,Finally!
325,Monica,What are we gonna do?
326,Chandler,I say we go with Careless Whisper.
327,Chandler,Did she see us yet?
328,Chandler,Did she see us?
329,Monica,"Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?"
330,Monica,Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren't they?
331,Chandler,Aren't you just a tinsy bit curious?
332,Monica,"Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom."
333,Monica,We'll justwe'll just let her stay.
334,Chandler,"No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!"
335,Monica,Kinda like your Barca lounger.
336,Chandler,Is that what you're thinking about right now?
337,Monica,I never stop thinking about it.
338,Chandler,"Janice, I'm sorry but umm, you can't stay here tonight."
339,Chandler,Honestly?
340,Chandler,Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity.
341,Chandler,"Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not."
342,Monica,Oh my God!
343,Monica,Oh my God!
344,Monica,You have to go!
345,Monica,Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
346,Chandler,Say again?
347,Monica,That's right.
348,Monica,That's right.
349,Monica,And that is why you can't stay here tonight.
350,Monica,And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
351,Chandler,"Feelings, such strong feelings."
352,Monica,"I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can."
353,Ross,"Don't sweat it, I've got this section covered."
354,Ross,"Yeah, in fact I've got this little baby  to shine in people's eyeOkay, see you later."
355,Chandler,I just wanted to show Monica your book.
356,Chandler,End
0,Monica,Hey guys!
1,Monica,"Ross, Rachel and"
2,Chandler,Hey!
3,Chandler,"Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend."
4,Monica,That place in Vermont?
5,Monica,You can  take   a hint!
6,Rachel,"Wait, you can't go away this weekend!"
7,Rachel,It's Emma's birthday!
8,Ross,Yeah!
9,Rachel,We're having a party.
10,Monica,"Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?"
11,Ross,No.
12,Rachel,"No,    that day... that won't be her real birthday!"
13,Chandler,Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday    was!
14,Ross,"C'mon you guys, this is really important to us."
15,Monica,"Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away."
16,Monica,"You know, to reconnect... emotionally."
17,Chandler,There's this thing I really want us to do.
18,Chandler,I read about it in Maxim...
19,Rachel,"Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?"
20,Ross,"Yeah, we want everyone to be there."
21,Ross,As much as I hate to delay your doing    weird sex stuff to my little sister.
22,Rachel,"And I mean, you know, you guys..."
23,Rachel,This is a big deal.
24,Rachel,"I mean, how can    we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!"
25,Monica,"All right, we'll stay."
26,Monica,We can just drive up after the party.
27,Chandler,"Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this    party..."
28,Monica,"Believe me, that is not why we won't    be doing that!"
29,Monica,OPENING CREDITS
30,Rachel,"You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would    hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure    map to help me find 'em all."
31,Phoebe,"Oooh, I love family traditions like that."
32,Phoebe,"When uhm...    when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood    to buy us food!"
33,Ross,Hey guys!
34,Ross,Rachel and
35,Phoebe,Hi!
36,Ross,"Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video."
37,Rachel,"Oh, good, good!"
38,Rachel,We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma    and we'll give it to her when she is 18.
39,Phoebe,"Oh, COOL!!"
40,Phoebe,"Wow, it's like a time capsule!"
41,Ross,Yeah!
42,Phoebe,"Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't    even been invented yet!"
43,Phoebe,With friends who right now are just like babies!
44,Phoebe,And    they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant    people!
45,Ross,That's the hope!
46,Ross,"So, is Emma awake yet?"
47,Rachel,"Oh no, it's still nap time."
48,Rachel,But she'll be up soon.
49,Ross,"Ah, and where is Joey?"
50,Rachel,I said it's still nap time.
51,Ross,"Hey, there is uncle Joey!"
52,Joey,Hey!
53,Ross,"Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!"
54,Joey,"18, uh?"
55,Ross,"Joey, NO!"
56,Joey,"What, what!?"
57,Joey,it's for her hot friends!
58,Ross,When they see this you'll be 52!
59,Joey,And starting to think about settling down!
60,Rachel,"Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents    on?"
61,Joey,I'd love to!
62,Joey,Yeah!
63,Joey,We were supposed to bring presents?
64,Phoebe,Yeah!
65,Phoebe,I wrote Emma a song.
66,Joey,"Oh, yeah!"
67,Joey,How was I supposed to know?
68,Phoebe,"Joey, it's a birthday party."
69,Joey,"Yeah, but for a one-year-old."
70,Joey,What's the point... the other day she laughed    for like an hour at a cup.
71,Joey,Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as    a farmer.
72,Joey,"And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says ""El-moo""!"
73,Joey,Yeah... that's a funny cup!
74,Monica,Hey!
75,Chandler,Hey hey!
76,Chandler,Where's the birthday girl?
77,Rachel,"Oh, she's still napping"
78,Chandler,"Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party    she knows is happening."
79,Rachel,"Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't    a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok?"
80,Rachel,Emma will never have a    first birthday again.
81,Monica,All right... you're right.
82,Monica,We're sorry.
83,Monica,Now let's wake up Emma and    get the fun time started!
84,Rachel,"No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up."
85,Monica,"Are you freaking kidding me, Green?"
86,Monica,Jack and
87,Ross,Hey!
88,Monica,So glad you came!
89,Ross,There's something you didn't know    about your dad!
90,Joey,Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller!
91,Joey,Let me help you with that.
92,Joey,"Oh man, this is great, uh?"
93,Joey,The three of us together again!
94,Joey,You know what    would be fun?
95,Joey,If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!
96,Monica,I can't believe Emma is still asleep!
97,Chandler,"I know, what are we gonna do?"
98,Monica,I've got a plan.
99,Monica,I've got a plan.
100,Monica,I'm going to ram this platter really    hard into your ribs.
101,Monica,You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!
102,Chandler,I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
103,Joey,"Hey Pheebs, you know what?"
104,Joey,"I was thinking... since you wrote a song,    maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!"
105,Phoebe,So you’re gonna... hit on her?
106,Joey,"No, no, no!"
107,Joey,My talents as an actor!
108,Phoebe,Oh!
109,Joey,"You know, I could like maybe..."
110,Joey,I could do a dramatic reading of one    of her books!
111,Phoebe,Or you could stick a fork in an apple!
112,Joey,"Hey, I think Emma might like it!"
113,Rachel,Oh!
114,Rachel,Emma might like what?
115,Joey,"Um, my present!"
116,Rachel,What did you get her?
117,Joey,Actually we prepared performances.
118,Phoebe,Separate performances.
119,Joey,But equally real!
120,Rachel,"Well, this sounds like fun!"
121,Rachel,"Well, you know what?"
122,Rachel,Actually?
123,Rachel,"People are    getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind    performing them once now?"
124,Phoebe,"Sure, yeah!"
125,Joey,O K.
126,Rachel,"All right, let’s get this party started, huh?"
127,Rachel,Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.
128,Ross,"Oh, great!"
129,Phoebe,Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing    prepared?
130,Joey,"Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole    crew waiting!"
131,Rachel,"So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?"
132,Joey,I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma’s books.
133,Rachel,"Oh, ok, which one?"
134,Joey,"Uh, why, it’s a...  one of her favorites, uh,     “Riding the Storm Out."
135,Joey,Coping with post-partum    depression” eesh!
136,Joey,“Love    you forever”.
137,Joey,Love you forever.
138,Joey,By Robert Munsch.
139,Joey,Published by Firefly    books.
140,Joey,Printed  in Mexico.
141,Joey,"A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and    forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang “I’ll love    you forever, I’ll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby    you’ll be”."
142,Joey,"And while he rocked her, he sang “I’ll love you forever, I’ll    like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you’ll be”."
143,Rachel,Wow!
144,Rachel,That was amazing!
145,Ross,Thank you so much for that gift!
146,Ross,Chandler
147,Ross,Amazing... amazing.
148,Rachel,"Oh, Phoebe, I’m sorry!"
149,Rachel,Phoebe has prepared something as well.
150,Phoebe,"That’s right, I've prepared a song for Emma."
151,Phoebe,From my heart to    hers.
152,Phoebe,"For there’s no greater gift, than the gift of music."
153,Phoebe,Emma!
154,Phoebe,Your name poses a dilemma.
155,Phoebe,'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma!
156,Phoebe,"Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo."
157,Phoebe,Happy    birthday Emma!
158,Rachel,Is that it?
159,Phoebe,"No, of course not!"
160,Phoebe,"I also, you know, prepared a reading ."
161,Phoebe,“Sex and the single mother.
162,Phoebe,Finding your G-spot.
163,Rachel,"Ross, um, don’t forget to get a shot of Emma’s cake."
164,Rachel,It’s    in a box in the fridge.
165,Ross,Sure.
166,Rachel,"Oh, you're gonna love this cake."
167,Rachel,"I got it from a bakery in New Jersey,    Corino’s."
168,Monica,"Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting!"
169,Monica,I use to hitchhike    there when I was a kid.
170,Rachel,"Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different    shapes, and if you give them a photo, they’ll copy it in icing!"
171,Monica,"Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?"
172,Rachel,Yes!
173,Rachel,On a cake shaped like a bunny.
174,Ross,"Uh, Rach?"
175,Ross,Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes?
176,Ross,Say    for bachelorette parties?
177,Rachel,"Ross, what are you talking about?"
178,Rachel,oh!
179,Rachel,Oh my God!
180,Rachel,They put my baby’s face on a penis!
181,Rachel,Phoebe
182,Rachel,"Why you guys this isn't funny, all right?"
183,Rachel,If I wanted this cake to    be a disaster I would have baked it myself!
184,Rachel,Joey
185,Ross,I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
186,Ross,Rachel
187,Ross,"Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby’s face off the    penis, so we can put it on the bunny."
188,Ross,That is a weird sentence!
189,Rachel,Oh!
190,Rachel,Believe you me!
191,Rachel,"I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even    want it in my home...  Joey, don't touch it!"
192,Joey,I'm so confused!
193,Rachel,"Yes, yes."
194,Rachel,"I still want    my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake."
195,Rachel,"Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with    nuts!"
196,Chandler,To be fair this one does have nuts.
197,Ross,"Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could    go and get the cake."
198,Monica,Oh.
199,Monica,"So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!"
200,Ross,"Well, you know what?"
201,Ross,"While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message    to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh?"
202,Ross,Ok!
203,Chandler,Hi Emma!
204,Chandler,It's the year 2020.
205,Chandler,Are you still enjoying your nap?
206,Monica,"We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way."
207,Monica,"You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!"
208,Chandler,"We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together    and things kind of unraveled."
209,Chandler,Because of you!
210,Chandler,Happy Birthday.
211,Monica,"Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now."
212,Monica,"We seriously have to    go, if we want to get to Vermont."
213,Monica,I called them and the last train leaves in    a half hour.
214,Phoebe,"And you know, I have a massage client soon."
215,Ross,"You guys, just please.. a little bit longer."
216,Ross,"I promise, Rachel will be    back with the cake any minute."
217,Ross,"Monica, remember.. the frosting?"
218,Ross,huh?
219,Monica,"Alright, 5 more minutes."
220,Ross,Hello?
221,Ross,Oh no!
222,Ross,What happened?
223,Ross,"Ok ok, where are you?"
224,Ross,"Ok, I'll be right    there."
225,Chandler,Was that Emma?
226,Chandler,Is she up?
227,Ross,"No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding."
228,Ross,She forgot    her licence so now I have to bring it to her.
229,Phoebe,"Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go."
230,Monica,No!
231,Monica,Wait!
232,Monica,If anybody gets to go.. it's us     We've been complaining the longest!
233,Ross,"No, wait !"
234,Ross,"You guys, no, no, you can't leave!"
235,Ross,Rachel already feels bad    that the cake's messed up.
236,Ross,How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes    back here and all you guys are gone?
237,Chandler,I don't know!
238,Chandler,You'll tell us on Monday!
239,Ross,Joey!
240,Ross,"You're in charge, ok?"
241,Ross,You make sure nobody leaves!
242,Joey,Got it!
243,Joey,Hey hey hey!
244,Joey,Where do you think you're going?
245,Chandler,To the bathroom!
246,Joey,"Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna    be here for a li..."
247,Joey,"Wait a minute, there is a window in there!"
248,Phoebe,Oh no!
249,Phoebe,He's not getting away that easy!
250,Chandler,What are you doing?
251,Chandler,Get the hell out of here!
252,Joey,"Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it."
253,Phoebe,"No, it did not."
254,Joey,No.
255,Joey,Ok!
256,Joey,Nighty-night!
257,Joey,"Bye, bye."
258,Phoebe,Joey?
259,Phoebe,How could you just let them leave?
260,Joey,"Hey, hey, hey, hey!"
261,Joey,"I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he    fought for our country."
262,Monica,"No, he didn't!"
263,Monica,He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.
264,Joey,Oh!
265,Joey,Well that's it!
266,Joey,He's the last one to go.
267,Joey,I'm locking you    guys in.
268,Chandler,"You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?"
269,Joey,Oh!
270,Joey,I forgot you used to live here!
271,Joey,Hello?
272,Joey,Hey!
273,Joey,What audition?
274,Joey,What?
275,Joey,You never said anything about an audition!
276,Joey,A monologue?
277,Joey,I don't have..
278,Joey,I got it.
279,Joey,Aah!
280,Joey,so...
281,Joey,I'm gonna take off!
282,Phoebe,Wh.. what?
283,Phoebe,"No wait, you don't get to leave!"
284,Phoebe,I've got a massage client    waiting outside my door any minute!
285,Monica,"Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right    now!"
286,Phoebe,"Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma."
287,Phoebe,"Ok, and as    the person who realized that, I get to go!"
288,Monica,No!
289,Monica,no!
290,Monica,Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.
291,Joey,Oh!
292,Joey,I got it!
293,Joey,"Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten."
294,Joey,Alright?
295,Joey,Whoever    gets the highest number gets to go first.
296,Monica,"Ok, ten."
297,Joey,"Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine!"
298,Joey,Anyone else?
299,Phoebe,"No, lets just draw straws."
300,Joey,"Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the.."
301,Chandler,I'm begging you stop.
302,Joey,Right.
303,Monica,"Ok, how about"
304,Phoebe,Yeah!!
305,Phoebe,Let's do that!
306,Chandler,That sounds more fun than the thing we were going    to do in Vermont!
307,Monica,Everybody get your toys!
308,Phoebe,Ok!
309,Phoebe,I want the dolphin!
310,Chandler,Thats a bear.
311,Phoebe,I'm too excited!
312,Monica,"Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler    and I get the dog."
313,Monica,"Ok, and the race is going to go  from here to here."
314,Monica,"Now the one who comes    in last, stays!"
315,Joey,"Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys!"
316,Chandler,"Ok, on your mark... Get set..."
317,Chandler,GO!!
318,Phoebe,Go!
319,Phoebe,Go!
320,Joey,Come on robot!
321,Monica,What are you barking at?
322,Monica,Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?
323,Chandler,I bought you.
324,Chandler,How did I forget that that's all you do?
325,Joey,Way to go robot!
326,Phoebe,Good job Alan!
327,Joey,"Hey, good race you guys."
328,Phoebe,"Yeah, see you later!"
329,Monica,No!
330,Monica,"No, no... wait!"
331,Monica,We didn't lose.
332,Monica,The rules clearly    stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser.
333,Monica,"Well, our dog    never crossed the finish line, so technically..."
334,Chandler,They left.
335,Rachel,"No, there isn't time to go to the bakery."
336,Rachel,We're just    gonna come home... Everybody left?
337,Rachel,"Alright, well just tell Emma we're gonna    be there as soon as we can."
338,Rachel,Bye...
339,Ross,RACHEL!
340,Rachel,OOH!
341,Rachel,God!
342,Rachel,Sorry!
343,Ross,I can't believe they gave you a ticket.
344,Ross,You're such a    good driver.
345,Rachel,Emma's awake.
346,Ross,Yeah?
347,Rachel,I can't believe this.
348,Rachel,This is her first birthday.
349,Rachel,She's awake.
350,Rachel,We're    not even there.
351,Rachel,Everybody left.
352,Rachel,We still have this stupid obscene cake.
353,Ross,"Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know."
354,Ross,Try to turn it into something else.
355,Rachel,"Oh, why do you even bother?"
356,Rachel,I already ruined her first birthday...    And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross?
357,Rachel,Very!
358,Rachel,According    to the back cover of that book that you gave me.
359,Ross,"Rach, she's not going to remember this."
360,Rachel,"I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this    day would be like, you know?"
361,Rachel,"Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her    cake singing ""Happy Birthday""."
362,Rachel,Then we would all go into... HEY GET    OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!!
363,Rachel,They have to learn!
364,Ross,Hey!
365,Rachel,What?
366,Ross,It's not bad.
367,Rachel,Oh my God!
368,Rachel,Look what... you made it into a    bunny.
369,Rachel,How did you do that?
370,Ross,"Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks."
371,Ross,And then I split this    to make ears.
372,Rachel,"Well, I'm very impressed."
373,Ross,"Some can sing, some can dance."
374,Ross,I apparently can turn phallic cakes into    woodland creatures.
375,Monica,"Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size."
376,Chandler,"I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?"
377,Monica,Game?
378,Chandler,"Emma, you even know it's your birthday today?"
379,Chandler,You're one!
380,Chandler,"One-year-old,    that's little."
381,Chandler,Ooh!
382,Chandler,That's my girl!
383,Monica,That's how old you are.
384,Chandler,Did I teach her that?
385,Chandler,Did I just... impart wisdom?
386,Monica,"Ooh, I want one..."
387,Chandler,Me too...
388,Chandler,There's no-one around.
389,Chandler,Why don't we just take this one?
390,Monica,...and head to Canada!
391,Chandler,I was kidding.
392,Monica,I wasn't.
393,Monica,Let's get going!
394,Phoebe,"Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?"
395,Chandler,"No, not yet."
396,Phoebe,"Oh good, I didn't miss the party."
397,Monica,What about your massage client?
398,Phoebe,"I just felt so bad, missing this."
399,Phoebe,"So I just slipped him a little something,    you know."
400,Phoebe,"As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright."
401,Joey,"Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time."
402,Joey,THE WHOLE    TIME!
403,Joey,I've been here the whole time!
404,Ross,"Joey, we just saw you come in."
405,Ross,You ran past us on the stairs.
406,Rachel,I don't care that you left.
407,Rachel,I'm just glad that you're here.
408,Rachel,Thanks    you guys!
409,Chandler,"Hey, guys!"
410,Chandler,Come on!
411,Chandler,You gotta see what Emma just did.
412,Rachel,What?
413,Chandler,"Emma, how old are you?"
414,Chandler,How old are you today?
415,Rachel,Oh!
416,Rachel,"Emma, that's right!"
417,Rachel,You're that many!
418,Ross,Oh my God!
419,Ross,Our daughter's a genius!
420,Ross,"Rach, this means..."
421,Rachel,"NO, no science camp!"
422,Ross,Damnit!
423,Ross,I'll put a candle on the cake.
424,Rachel,Oh!...
425,Rachel,"Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!"
426,Monica,Thanks!
427,Ross,"Okay, here we go!"
428,Ross,"Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow    out the candle."
429,Ross,Come on Emma.
430,Chandler,"Let's do it, come on!"
431,Ross,What's wrong?
432,Ross,Are you okay?
433,Rachel,"Oh yeah, nothing!"
434,Rachel,These are happy tears!
435,Rachel,This is just what I wanted.
436,Phoebe,"Hey, you made it into a bunny."
437,Joey,What is wrong with me.
438,Joey,It looked more delicious when it    was a penis.
439,Joey,ENDING CREDITS
440,Rachel,Okay.
441,Ross,"Okay, you ready?"
442,Rachel,Yeah.
443,Ross,A-a-and... record.
444,Rachel,Okay.
445,Rachel,Hi Emma.
446,Rachel,"Well,    your first birthday is over, and it was really..."
447,Phoebe,"Go, go, go Alan!"
448,Phoebe,"Run you, hairy bastard!"
449,Phoebe,end
0,Phoebe,"Oh, hey Joey."
1,Joey,"Uh, hey."
2,Phoebe,"Listen, I need to ask you something."
3,Phoebe,"Ok, you know how my step dad's in prison."
4,Joey,Yeah.
5,Phoebe,Yeah.
6,Phoebe,"Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday."
7,Joey,So he can't come?
8,Phoebe,"No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it."
9,Joey,Seriously?
10,Phoebe,"Yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me."
11,Phoebe,"I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom..."
12,Joey,I am pretty wisdomous.
13,Phoebe,So... what do you say?
14,Joey,Are you kidding?
15,Joey,"Phoebe, I would be honored."
16,Phoebe,"Oh, thank you."
17,Phoebe,I hope...
18,Phoebe,I hope you know how much you mean to me.
19,Joey,"Listen, I hope... that you know..."
20,Joey,"I don't want you to see your father cry, GO TO YOUR ROOM!"
21,Joey,OPENING CREDITS
22,Phoebe,Oh.
23,Joey,"Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this."
24,Phoebe,"Oh, it's my wedding planner."
25,Phoebe,She's driving me crazy!
26,Phoebe,"Hello... Hey, ok, stop screaming!"
27,Phoebe,Ok?
28,Phoebe,"So, halibut."
29,Phoebe,"All right, so salmon, either way."
30,Phoebe,I don't-I don't... it doesn't matter to me!
31,Monica,"Well, it matters to me!"
32,Phoebe,"Well, I don't care, so you pick!"
33,Monica,Did you just hung up on me?
34,Monica,"All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours."
35,Phoebe,Uh-uh.
36,Phoebe,Ok. What time is that.
37,Monica,You don't know military time?
38,Phoebe,"Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that."
39,Monica,Just subtract twelve.
40,Phoebe,"Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and..."
41,Monica,Six o'clock!
42,Phoebe,Ok.
43,Monica,Ok.
44,Monica,Hold on.
45,Monica,Geller here!
46,Monica,No!
47,Monica,I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock.
48,Monica,Goodbye.
49,Monica,"Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?"
50,Phoebe,Ice sculpture?
51,Phoebe,That sounds really fancy!
52,Phoebe,I told you I just want a simple wedding.
53,Monica,"Please... honey, leave the details to me."
54,Monica,Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can.
55,Monica,"Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white."
56,Phoebe,What harpist?
57,Phoebe,My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.
58,Monica,Ooh... she backed out.
59,Phoebe,She did?
60,Phoebe,Why?
61,Monica,I made her.
62,Monica,"Steel drums don't really say ""elegant wedding""."
63,Monica,Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.
64,Phoebe,Hey!
65,Phoebe,She will shower when Tibet is free.
66,Chandler,Hey!
67,Phoebe,Hey!
68,Chandler,You look great.
69,Chandler,"I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them."
70,Phoebe,"Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?"
71,Chandler,No stupid jokes.
72,Chandler,I thought that was for the actual wedding.
73,Phoebe,Rehearse it!
74,Ross,Hi!
75,Ross,"Oh,  hey, oh..."
76,Ross,I...
77,Ross,I was-I was going for a hand shake.
78,Ross,That is why!
79,Phoebe,So Rach.
80,Rachel,Yeah.
81,Phoebe,Where is Emma?
82,Rachel,"Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's."
83,Rachel,Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.
84,Monica,Are you still crying about your damn baby?
85,Monica,"Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person."
86,Monica,Your see these clowns all the time!
87,Joey,"Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?"
88,Joey,Mike's
89,Joey,"Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?"
90,Joey,Mike's
91,Joey,"You know, on the one hand you're happy for them, but on the other hand it's hard to let go."
92,Joey,Mike's
93,Joey,"Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy?"
94,Joey,But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!
95,Chandler,You know what I just realized?
96,Chandler,We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
97,Ross,"Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now?"
98,Ross,When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?
99,Rachel,Uh... November?
100,Ross,I wanna say it's not looking good.
101,Rachel,Hey Pheebs...
102,Phoebe,What's up?
103,Rachel,Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.
104,Chandler,Heh.
105,Phoebe,"Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding."
106,Ross,What?
107,Rachel,"Well, this is really awkward  Oh, and I can leave!"
108,Phoebe,"I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut."
109,Ross,"Oh, man!"
110,Chandler,This is like figure skating team all over again.
111,Chandler,I mean synchronized swimming.
112,Chandler,I mean- I mean the balance beam.
113,Chandler,Help me!
114,Ross,FOOTBALL!
115,Chandler,Thank you.
116,Monica,"Pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it."
117,Phoebe,Oh!
118,Phoebe,I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!
119,Monica,"Yeah, I changed them."
120,Monica,I-I sent you a fax about it!
121,Phoebe,I don't have a fax machine.
122,Monica,"Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!"
123,Ross,I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.
124,Chandler,"I know, I hate being left out of things."
125,Ross,And it's a wedding!
126,Ross,It'd be weird if I'm not in it...
127,Chandler,Fine.
128,Chandler,We're just sitting here.
129,Chandler,Alone.
130,Chandler,Doing nothing.
131,Chandler,It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
132,Chandler,What happened?
133,Ross,"Who cares, AND?"
134,Ross,I'll do it!
135,Chandler,M-Me-me-me!
136,Chandler,"Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus."
137,Ross,"No, Mike, no, no."
138,Ross,"You wanna pick me, I mean... watch!"
139,Ross,Huh?
140,Ross,"Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman."
141,Chandler,"Oh, I will."
142,Chandler,But I will need a mirror... as he is me!
143,Ross,"Please, you're going down!"
144,Chandler,You are going downer!
145,Ross,Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?
146,Chandler,"I wouldn't know, I didn't make it!"
147,Joey,"So, you know I'm filling in for Phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?"
148,Joey,"Oh, hey, my pleasure."
149,Joey,So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?
150,Joey,"Oh, a wiseacre."
151,Joey,"No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano?"
152,Joey,Isn't that kind of unstable?
153,Joey,Strike two!
154,Joey,Strike three!
155,Joey,"You only get one more, Mike!"
156,Ross,"So, what did you decide?"
157,Phoebe,I decided to pee.
158,Chandler,Mike didn't tell you?
159,Chandler,You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding.
160,Chandler,One of his groomsmen fell out.
161,Phoebe,"Oh no, no."
162,Phoebe,I can't choose between you two!
163,Phoebe,I love you both so much!
164,Chandler,Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
165,Phoebe,"Oh, I don't wanna choose!"
166,Phoebe,It's .
167,Phoebe,"Oh okay, wait."
168,Phoebe,Rach!
169,Phoebe,Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today.
170,Rachel,"Goody, what is it!"
171,Phoebe,"Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler."
172,Phoebe,So good luck with that.
173,Rachel,"What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that."
174,Phoebe,"All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid."
175,Ross,I'll do it!
176,Monica,"Ok, it's 2100 hours."
177,Monica,Time for your toast.
178,Monica,You had a bathroom break at 2030.
179,Monica,"Pee on your own time, Mike!"
180,Monica,"Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches."
181,Monica,Okay.
182,Monica,"You just get in, do your thing and get out!"
183,Monica,It's 2101 and I am not amused.
184,Monica,"Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say."
185,Phoebe,Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight.
186,Phoebe,"So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start."
187,Phoebe,"My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I...  oh I... hum..."
188,Phoebe,I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because...  it's not important... she is in rehab.
189,Phoebe,"Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and  but despite, you know... it got... it got good."
190,Phoebe,"Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here... Monica"
191,Phoebe,And... moment's over!
192,Phoebe,"So, ok, uh, I can forget that."
193,Phoebe,I can forget that and uhm...  Oh this is funny!
194,Phoebe,"Oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... Oh, ok, well, uhm, I ."
195,Phoebe,"Ok, ok, I, ok, I.... MONICA I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS!"
196,Phoebe,THIS IS MY WEDDING!
197,Phoebe,"OKAY, I DON'T WANT THIS  OR THIS  OR THIS  OK?"
198,Phoebe,I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING!
199,Phoebe,WHERE MY FIANCEE CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS!
200,Phoebe,You know what?
201,Phoebe,You're done.
202,Monica,What?
203,Phoebe,YOU'RE FIRED!
204,Phoebe,Cheers!
205,Phoebe,Hey!
206,Rachel,Happy wedding day!
207,Phoebe,"Oh, happy my wedding day to you!"
208,Rachel,"Ok-dokey, Joey, listen."
209,Rachel,"This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right?"
210,Rachel,"We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages."
211,Joey,"Oh, man!"
212,Joey,I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!
213,Monica,Hi.
214,Monica,About last night...
215,Monica,"I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back."
216,Phoebe,"Oh, well that's ok."
217,Phoebe,I think you and I will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid.
218,Monica,"Oh, is that so?"
219,Monica,Ok.
220,Monica,"If that's really what you want, then here..."
221,Monica,I give you the headset.
222,Monica,"Well, I don't really want to give you the headset."
223,Monica,"Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages."
224,Phoebe,"Wow, this is a lot!"
225,Monica,"Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this."
226,Monica,"I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine."
227,Phoebe,You won awards?
228,Monica,Mm-mh.
229,Monica,I printed them out on my computer.
230,Ross,Hey!
231,Monica,Hi.
232,Ross,Where's Rach?
233,Monica,"She's in her room, why?"
234,Ross,"I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok?"
235,Ross,I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump!
236,Ross,Oh!
237,Ross,My God!
238,Ross,You're breathtaking!
239,Rachel,What d'you want?
240,Ross,"You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?"
241,Rachel,"Oh, Ross, c'mon, please!"
242,Rachel,Don't make this harder than it already is!
243,Ross,I'm not!
244,Ross,I'm making it easier!
245,Ross,Pick me!
246,Rachel,"Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!"
247,Ross,"Listen, listen."
248,Ross,Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you!
249,Ross,"Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!"
250,Rachel,"Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!"
251,Ross,"YES, YES!"
252,Phoebe,Sven I don't understand what you're saying!
253,Phoebe,What is wrong with the flowers?
254,Phoebe,Lorkins?
255,Phoebe,What the hell are lorkins?
256,Monica,I know.
257,Phoebe,"Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word ""lorkins"" what flowers would that be?"
258,Phoebe,Right there!
259,Phoebe,That's why I'm marrying you!
260,Joey,Hello Michael.
261,Joey,"May I have a word with you, please?"
262,Joey,Have a seat.
263,Joey,"Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me..."
264,Joey,I cannot allow this.
265,Joey,More back talk.
266,Joey,"And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for ""Family Honor"
267,Joey,I want you to take this seriously!
268,Joey,"Phoebe is very very important to me, ok?"
269,Joey,And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.
270,Joey,That's what I wanted to hear!
271,Joey,"Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family."
272,Joey,That was ME!
273,Rachel,Hi
274,Chandler,"Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing?"
275,Chandler,"If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine."
276,Chandler,"But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!"
277,Rachel,"Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross."
278,Chandler,Let me tell you why you need to pick me.
279,Chandler,"See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure."
280,Chandler,"You know, I was always picked last in gym."
281,Chandler,Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball.
282,Chandler,"I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third."
283,Chandler,"Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back."
284,Rachel,"All right fine, I pick you."
285,Chandler,Y-Y-YEEESSS!
286,Chandler,"Make ""groom"" for Chandler."
287,Rachel,Oh my...
288,Phoebe,No!
289,Phoebe,We're gonna do it my way.
290,Phoebe,Because your way is stupid!
291,Phoebe,"Alright I gotta go, I have another call, Reverend."
292,Phoebe,Hello?
293,Joey,I'm glad we had this little talk.
294,Phoebe,Okay.
295,Monica,Bye.
296,Phoebe,"Oh my God, what's it doing here?"
297,Monica,"Ugh, I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address."
298,Monica,Uh!
299,Monica,What a pickle.
300,Phoebe,"Oh my God, everything is such a mess."
301,Phoebe,Why is this happening to me?
302,Joey,How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that?
303,Chandler,How's it going?
304,Ross,Good.
305,Ross,I'm just getting some coffee.
306,Ross,So I'm alert for the wedding.
307,Chandler,That's what I was doing too.
308,Ross,"Well, you have fun tonight."
309,Chandler,You too.
310,Ross,"Oh, I will."
311,Chandler,Me too.
312,Ross,"Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you?"
313,Chandler,I'm not supposed to tell you.
314,Ross,I'm not supposed to tell you!
315,Chandler,You told us both we could be in the wedding?
316,Rachel,"Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other."
317,Ross,"Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose."
318,Ross,You and me together again.
319,Chandler,"Rach, Rach, knock knock."
320,Rachel,Who's there?
321,Chandler,I'll tell you at the wedding.
322,Rachel,Uh.
323,Rachel,"You know what, I can't do this."
324,Rachel,I don't know which one of you guys to pick.
325,Ross,What?
326,Ross,A dog?
327,Ross,No!
328,Ross,Rachel gets to choose.
329,Rachel,"Wow, this is a tough one."
330,Rachel,I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog.
331,Phoebe,"Alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not?"
332,Phoebe,"Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!"
333,Monica,How's it going?
334,Phoebe,Help me.
335,Monica,What?
336,Phoebe,I want you to be Crazy Bitch again.
337,Monica,Really?
338,Phoebe,Please?
339,Monica,You really want me to come back?
340,Phoebe,More than I wanna get married.
341,Monica,"Ok people, we are back in business!"
342,Monica,"Oh God, we've missed you soo much!"
343,Monica,"Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything."
344,Joey,"Hey, what are you guys gonna do?"
345,Phoebe,About what?
346,Joey,The blizzard.
347,Joey,"I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years!"
348,Joey,They already closed all the bridges and tunnels.
349,Monica,Ooh!
350,Monica,But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!
351,Joey,I don't think they are.
352,Ross,Haha!
353,Ross,Looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either.
354,Ross,So sorry Pheebs.
355,Monica,"Well, the club lost it's power."
356,Joey,"Yeah according to the news, most of the city did."
357,Rachel,Since when do you watch the news?
358,Joey,"Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl."
359,Ross,I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.
360,Phoebe,I know.
361,Rachel,"Wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there."
362,Rachel,You always wanted to get married outside.
363,Rachel,Why don't you guys just do it on the street?
364,Phoebe,What?
365,Rachel,"Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore."
366,Rachel,I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting.
367,Rachel,This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!
368,Phoebe,What do you think?
369,Phoebe,Me too!
370,Phoebe,"Monica, do you think we could do it?"
371,Monica,AFFIRMATIVE!
372,Monica,OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE!
373,Monica,"Gunther, hit the Christmas lights."
374,Monica,"Okay, who left the ice sculpture  ON THE STEAM GRATE?"
375,Monica,Mike's
376,Chandler,"So technically, would this person be in the wedding?"
377,Ross,I'll do it!
378,Ross,"No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?"
379,Chandler,I'm not scared.
380,Chandler,I'll just take little Chappy and...
381,Chandler,HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR.
382,Chandler,MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.
383,Ross,"Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then."
384,Ross,Ha haaa...
385,Ross,He stinks!
386,Monica,Level 1 alert.
387,Monica,"I repeat, level 1."
388,Monica,This is not a drill.
389,Monica,Okay we've got a situation.
390,Monica,The minister just called.
391,Monica,He's snowed in.
392,Monica,He can't make it.
393,Joey,"Oh hey, don't worry."
394,Joey,I'm still ordained from your wedding.
395,Monica,Really?
396,Joey,"Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway?"
397,Joey,Huhuh...
398,Ross,"Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free."
399,Joey,"I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do."
400,Monica,"Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle."
401,Chandler,I'll do it.
402,Ross,I'll...
403,Chandler,Na ha ha...  Ne he he...  Ah ah...
404,Monica,"Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position."
405,Monica,"Chandler, come with me."
406,Monica,"Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony and Chandler's giving you away."
407,Phoebe,"Oh, okay."
408,Phoebe,Hi new dad.
409,Monica,"So, you're ready to do this?"
410,Phoebe,"Uhuh, uhuh... Oh my God!"
411,Phoebe,This is really happening.
412,Rachel,"Oh Phoebe, I'm so happy for you honey."
413,Phoebe,"Oh, thank you."
414,Monica,I love you.
415,Monica,"Oh, wait, wait, wait!"
416,Monica,No hugs.
417,Monica,The dresses... Oh what the hell.
418,Phoebe,I love you guys.
419,Phoebe,Rachel and
420,Monica,I love you.
421,Monica,Okay.
422,Monica,It's zero hour.
423,Monica,All teams execute on my count.
424,Monica,Let's get this bad boy on the road.
425,Chandler,Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
426,Monica,I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.
427,Chandler,Oh yeah!
428,Monica,"Okay Marjorie, hit it."
429,Rachel,"Geez Ross, you could have showered."
430,Ross,It's the dog.
431,Monica,"Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid?"
432,Monica,We've got a broken arrow.
433,Monica,Bridesmaid down!
434,Monica,"Oh, that's me."
435,Chandler,Ready?
436,Phoebe,Okay.
437,Chandler,Okay.
438,Phoebe,"Oh wait, oh no."
439,Phoebe,Wait.
440,Chandler,Wow!
441,Chandler,Aren't you gonna be cold?
442,Phoebe,I don't care...
443,Phoebe,I'll be my something blue.
444,Chandler,You look beautiful.
445,Phoebe,Thank you.
446,Phoebe,Na-ah.
447,Joey,"Friends, family, dog..."
448,Joey,Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event.
449,Joey,The cold has now spread to my special place... so I'm gonna do the short version of this.
450,Joey,Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other.
451,Joey,And I know I speak for every one here... when I wish them a lifetime of happiness.
452,Joey,Who has the rings?
453,Joey,Okay...
454,Phoebe,"When I was growing up, I didn't have a normal mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, and I always knew that something was missing."
455,Phoebe,"But now I'm standing here today, knowing that I have everything I'm ever gonna need... You are my family."
456,Phoebe,"Oh wait, oh I forgot... and uhm..."
457,Phoebe,I love you... and you have nice eyes.
458,Ross,Uh Joey...
459,Joey,Yeah?
460,Ross,Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.
461,Joey,"Oh, okay."
462,Joey,"Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?"
463,Phoebe,I do.
464,Joey,"Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?"
465,Joey,I now pronounce you... husband and wife.
466,Phoebe,I got married!
467,Phoebe,"Could someone get me a coat, I'm freaking freezing."
468,Phoebe,COMMERCIAL BREAK
469,Chandler,That really was an incredible wedding.
470,Joey,"It was, yeah."
471,Joey,I kind of don't want it to end.
472,Joey,"Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?"
473,Chandler,"I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had."
474,Joey,Nice.
475,Joey,"Oh hey, what about Ross?"
476,Chandler,I don't know.
477,Chandler,Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
478,Ross,"Come on Chappy, do your business."
479,Ross,MAKE!
480,Ross,MA-AKE!
481,Ross,I did not sign on for this.
482,Ross,THE END
0,Chandler,Hey!
1,Phoebe,Hey!
2,Phoebe,Check it out!
3,Phoebe,This is unbelievable!
4,Phoebe,Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
5,Joey,Dude!
6,Joey,What are yoyou trying to kill me?
7,Rachel,"Pheebs, I wanna ask you something."
8,Phoebe,"Uh-huh, what?"
9,Rachel,Well since I'm movin' out and-and you're so beautiful
10,Phoebe,Oh!
11,Rachel,how about I move in with you?
12,Phoebe,"Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?"
13,Monica,Who's Denise?
14,Phoebe,My roommate.
15,Rachel,You have a roommate?
16,Phoebe,"Yes, Denise."
17,Phoebe,Denise!
18,Joey,"Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe?"
19,Joey,Huh?
20,Joey,"And what about this Denise, is she cute?"
21,Chandler,"Pheebs, I don't understand."
22,Chandler,How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
23,Phoebe,Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say.
24,Phoebe,I talk about her all the time!
25,Phoebe,DENISE!!!!
26,Joey,"Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin' uh, I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place"
27,Rachel,"Oh, that's true."
28,Joey,"Yeah, why don't you move in with me?"
29,Joey,It'll be great!
30,Joey,"We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday's right?"
31,Rachel,"Yeah, yeah I think I'm gonna find my own place."
32,Chandler,Hey-hey!
33,Chandler,I thought Naked Thursday's was just our thing man!
34,Chandler,Opening Credits
35,Phoebe,Hey.
36,Ross,Hey!
37,Phoebe,"So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?"
38,Ross,"Oh, that."
39,Ross,"Umm, she took it really well."
40,Phoebe,You didn't tell her did you?
41,Ross,No.
42,Phoebe,"Of course not, because you're in love with her."
43,Ross,I am not in love with her.
44,Ross,"She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn't tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset."
45,Ross,"I-I just comforted her, as a friend."
46,Phoebe,"What do you mean, comforted her?"
47,Ross,"It's nothing, I just gave her a hug."
48,Phoebe,Ah-ha!
49,Phoebe,"A classic sign of love, the hug!"
50,Ross,It's also a sign of friendship.
51,Phoebe,"Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson."
52,Ross,It was a hug!
53,Phoebe,"Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?"
54,Ross,S-s-smell her hair?
55,Ross,What if I did?
56,Phoebe,Ninety percent of a women's pheromones come out the top of her head!
57,Phoebe,"That's why, that's why women are shorter."
58,Phoebe,So that men will fall in love when they hug them!
59,Phoebe,"Oh come on Ross, you're a scientist."
60,Ross,I was hugging her as a friend.
61,Ross,"It's not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she's got a lot of it and it smells all-all uhcoconutty."
62,Ross,What?!
63,Ross,"Oh, that doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel!"
64,Ross,Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!
65,Phoebe,"Okay, whatever you say."
66,Phoebe,"But just be careful, all right?"
67,Phoebe,Rachel's not in the same place you are.
68,Ross,"If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!"
69,Phoebe,"Okay, I didn't understand that, but y'know, maybe that's cause you were speaking the secret language of love!"
70,Joey,Hey!
71,Joey,"Dude, some guy just called for you."
72,Chandler,Who was it?
73,Joey,I don't know!
74,Joey,"How about, ""Thanks for taking the message."""
75,Joey,Jeez!
76,Monica,"Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?"
77,Chandler,Sure!
78,Monica,"Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right?"
79,Monica,With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time!
80,Monica,And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!!
81,Monica,"Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much."
82,Chandler,"Well, I like that idea."
83,Chandler,Obviously!
84,Chandler,"I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know?"
85,Chandler,"I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones!"
86,Chandler,The big-big ones!
87,Monica,No.
88,Chandler,"Okay so you mean no as in, ""Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea."
89,Chandler,"Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."""
90,Monica,"Oh, I'm sorry."
91,Monica,Of course I mean that.
92,Monica,"Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no."
93,Chandler,"So, that's it?"
94,Monica,I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room.
95,Monica,The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
96,Chandler,Which is why Asteroids is perfect!
97,Chandler,It's the oldest game!
98,Monica,What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
99,Chandler,"I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!"
100,Monica,Are you mocking me?
101,Chandler,"No, I'm not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room."
102,Joey,"Hey, what's up?"
103,Chandler,"Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight."
104,Joey,"But you're still moving in together, right?"
105,Joey,Because my ad came out today.
106,Chandler,"""Wanted."
107,Chandler,"Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."""
108,Chandler,Nice!
109,Joey,Yeah?
110,Joey,"I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know?"
111,Joey,"Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me."
112,Joey,And what's more different than me; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19?
113,Joey,Enh?
114,Joey,Not just a hat rack my friend!
115,Rachel,"Pheebs, I have to ask you"
116,Phoebe,Shhhhhh!
117,Phoebe,I'm swamped right now.
118,Rachel,You're just staring into space.
119,Phoebe,"Umm, I'm trying to move that pencil."
120,Rachel,This one?
121,Phoebe,It worked!
122,Rachel,"Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare!"
123,Rachel,Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak.
124,Rachel,"I mean, look at this;  ""Wanted."
125,Rachel,"Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."""
126,Rachel,"It's just, there is nothing!"
127,Rachel,The city's full!
128,Phoebe,"Wait, no, look at this!"
129,Phoebe,"""Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay"" Oh, yeah, but it's on the ground floor."
130,Ross,Hey!
131,Rachel,Hey.
132,Ross,"Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?"
133,Rachel,Yeah!
134,Rachel,Why?
135,Ross,"Okay, there's this guy, Warren, from the museum and he's going on a dig for like two years and he's got this great place he needs to sublet."
136,Ross,"So uh, you interested?"
137,Rachel,That sounds great!
138,Rachel,I'd love to live at Warren's!!
139,Rachel,I love Warren!
140,Rachel,Thank you!
141,Ross,Don't thank me!
142,Ross,"If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization."
143,Ross,Here's Warren's number.
144,Rachel,"Oh, this is great!"
145,Rachel,I am gonna call him right now!
146,Rachel,"Oh, thank you!"
147,Ross,"Okay, you go grab it!"
148,Phoebe,I saw it.
149,Ross,I don't know what you're talking about.
150,Phoebe,"Umm, I'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit."
151,Phoebe,You love her again; you re-love her!
152,Ross,"Look, I do not re-love her."
153,Phoebe,I can't believe you won't just admit it!
154,Phoebe,"Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid."
155,Ross,"Look, we're just friends now!"
156,Ross,Okay?
157,Ross,Why would I do anything stupid?
158,Rachel,Ugh!!!
159,Rachel,"Well, the apartment is already subletted!"
160,Rachel,"I mean, this is just hopeless."
161,Rachel,I'm never gonna find anything.
162,Ross,You can live with me.
163,Rachel,What?
164,Phoebe,What?
165,Ross,What?
166,Ross,Commercial Break
167,Rachel,Oh my God!
168,Rachel,Are you serious?
169,Ross,Uh-huh.
170,Rachel,I would love to live with you Ross; that's-that's great!
171,Rachel,Thank you!
172,Ross,"Well, I'm-I'm just glad I could, y'know, help you out."
173,Phoebe,Wow!
174,Phoebe,I'm-I'm so happy for you guys.
175,Phoebe,"This is so-so, not stupid."
176,Rachel,"Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me!"
177,Rachel,"I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless."
178,Rachel,You just saved me!
179,Rachel,You're my hero!
180,Ross,"Hero, I uh, I don't knowwell, all right."
181,Rachel,"Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!"
182,Ross,Oh please!
183,Ross,"You're gonna say things now, aren't ya?"
184,Phoebe,No.
185,Phoebe,"No, I won't."
186,Phoebe,"But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise."
187,Phoebe,"She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn't love her, but he really did, and it just blew up!"
188,Phoebe,And that's how she ended up living with me!
189,Phoebe,"Okay, that's a lie."
190,Chandler,Hi.
191,Monica,Hi.
192,Chandler,"Hi, listen, I'm sorry about before."
193,Chandler,I don't need to have a game room.
194,Chandler,"I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn't get girls, and now I can emNow, I have you."
195,Chandler,"Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women"
196,Monica,Stop it Chandler.
197,Monica,I'm sorry too.
198,Chandler,Really?
199,Monica,Yeah!
200,Monica,Oh yes!
201,Chandler,Ohh.
202,Monica,"Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together."
203,Chandler,That's a great idea!
204,Chandler,We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
205,Monica,Totally!
206,Chandler,We don't have to come up with this now.
207,Monica,Oh good.
208,Chandler,"Hey, y'know what?"
209,Chandler,Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?
210,Monica,Changes?
211,Chandler,"Yeah, I mean we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair."
212,Monica,You're-you're-you're gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
213,Chandler,Is that a problem?
214,Monica,"Well, it's a set and they should probably stay together."
215,Chandler,"Oh, that's cool."
216,Chandler,Then I'll just bring them both over.
217,Monica,See now-now you're taking them away from their home.
218,Chandler,"Okay, I get it."
219,Chandler,"So, I get nothing!"
220,Chandler,Nothing here is mine!
221,Chandler,Everything here is yours!
222,Chandler,"I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!"
223,Monica,"Yeah-yeah, y'know what?"
224,Monica,"Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine!"
225,Monica,Nothing will be yours!
226,Monica,That's-that's what I said!
227,Monica,"Oh come on, Chandler!"
228,Monica,I'm talking about the barca lounger!
229,Monica,"It just, it doesn't match!"
230,Monica,Where is it gonna go?
231,Chandler,In the game room!
232,Monica,Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
233,Chandler,All right!
234,Chandler,That's fine!
235,Chandler,That's fine!
236,Chandler,I won't bring over the chairs!
237,Chandler,I won't bring anything over!
238,Chandler,I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma's place!
239,Joey,Everything on your application looks really goodOhh!
240,Joey,"Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?"
241,Joey,The Potential
242,Joey,Whoa!!
243,Joey,"Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out."
244,Joey,I want you to really think about your answers.
245,Joey,Okay?
246,Chandler,You can call off the roommate search!
247,Chandler,Hi!
248,Chandler,I'll be living here.
249,Joey,"Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it."
250,Chandler,Why did you take the shower curtain down?
251,Joey,That thing was a hazard!
252,Joey,I'm very safety conscious.
253,Rachel,Hey!
254,Ross,Hey!
255,Ross,"Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff."
256,Rachel,"Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in."
257,Ross,"What do you mean, they're not moving in?"
258,Ross,They-they're still moving in right?
259,Rachel,"No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room."
260,Ross,What?!
261,Ross,Over a stupid room!
262,Rachel,"Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I'm also really psyched cause I don't have to move in here!"
263,Ross,"Oh no, yeah no, that part's great!"
264,Ross,What's all this about you guys fighting?!
265,Ross,Is this really over a room?!
266,Ross,"I mean, that is so silly!"
267,Monica,"Ross, we can handle this."
268,Ross,"Well, apparently not, and I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly."
269,Ross,"I mean, enough of the silliness!"
270,Chandler,"Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!"
271,Ross,Okay-okay!
272,Ross,"Two very good points, look I've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together."
273,Ross,Do you really want to throw that all away over a room?
274,Ross,That is so silly.
275,Ross,"Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?"
276,Chandler,"Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love."
277,Monica,Love is the best medicine.
278,Chandler,That's laughter.
279,Monica,Why do you do it?
280,Chandler,I don't know.
281,Ross,Okay!
282,Ross,All right!
283,Ross,"Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?"
284,Chandler,"Yeah, I do."
285,Ross,"And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don't ya?"
286,Monica,Yes.
287,Ross,Good!
288,Ross,A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
289,Rachel,"No-no, I'm staying put."
290,Rachel,"Why, where are you going?"
291,Ross,Hey Rach!
292,Rachel,Hi!
293,Ross,"You're never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again."
294,Ross,That's great news rightI mean for them.
295,Ross,Right?
296,Rachel,Oh wow.
297,Ross,"Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again."
298,Rachel,Yeah.
299,Rachel,"Y'know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don't you think it's gonna be weird?"
300,Ross,Wh-why?!
301,Ross,"Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?"
302,Rachel,"Well, because of us!"
303,Rachel,Because of our history.
304,Ross,No!
305,Rachel,No?
306,Ross,No!
307,Ross,No!
308,Ross,"It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?"
309,Rachel,No!
310,Rachel,Not at all!
311,Ross,Good!
312,Ross,Me neither!
313,Ross,So it's not a problem.
314,Ross,We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
315,Rachel,"Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating."
316,Ross,Really?!
317,Ross,We are?
318,Rachel,Yeah!
319,Rachel,"I'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend"
320,Ross,Ohh!
321,Ross,That would be great.
322,Rachel,"But y'know what, if you think it's gonna be okay we'll just work out a system."
323,Rachel,"Y'know, it'll be like college, I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, ""Come back later, I'm gettin' lucky."""
324,Ross,"Yeah, I didn't think of that."
325,Ross,So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?!
326,Ross,I mean it's a really big step!
327,Ross,And-and what's the rush?
328,Monica,That's very funny!
329,Chandler,"He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!"
330,Ross,"No, I-I-I'm serious, okay?"
331,Ross,"I mean, think about it."
332,Ross,"You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!"
333,Monica,"Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room."
334,Ross,"Okay, there are no stupid fights!!"
335,Ross,"This isn't about the room, this is about what the roomrepresents!"
336,Ross,"And unfortunately, this room  could destroy you!"
337,Chandler,"Yeah, I'm not so worried."
338,Monica,"Yeah, no, me neither."
339,Ross,Fine!
340,Ross,It's your life!
341,Ross,I just don't want to see you guys break up!
342,Ross,"Which you will do if you move in together,  but that's what you want, there's nothing I can do."
343,Ross,DON'T DO IT!!!!
344,Monica,You still want to move in together right?
345,Chandler,Of course!
346,Monica,Ross didn't scare you?
347,Chandler,Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
348,Monica,"Come here, I want to show you something!"
349,Chandler,Okay!
350,Chandler,", the coffee table forward , and taped a square outline on the floor.)"
351,Chandler,Oh my God!
352,Chandler,Someone's killed Square Man!
353,Monica,This is where I thought the barca lounger could go!
354,Monica,You see you could see the TV and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.
355,Chandler,Oh that's so sweet!
356,Chandler,I want to show you something too!
357,Monica,Okay!
358,Chandler,"Y'know those big-big uh, road signs that say ""Merge?"""
359,Monica,Uh-hmm.
360,Chandler,Y'know?
361,Chandler,So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed.
362,Chandler,"Because, that's you and I together!"
363,Chandler,Merge!
364,Monica,Oh my God!
365,Monica,I love that!
366,Chandler,Really?
367,Monica,"Uh, no!"
368,Phoebe,I found you in my bed!
369,Phoebe,How'd you whined up there?
370,Phoebe,You are a mystery!
371,Phoebe,Little black curly hair!
372,Phoebe,Little black curly hair!
373,Phoebe,"Little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly hair"
374,Phoebe,"Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer."
375,Ross,"So umm, where are the other guys?"
376,Rachel,"Umm, well let's see Monica and Chandler are occupied."
377,Ross,Fighting?
378,Rachel,"No, the other thing."
379,Rachel,I really think it's great they work things out.
380,Ross,Yeah.
381,Ross,"There's no breaking them up, is there?"
382,Rachel,"Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?"
383,Ross,Sure!
384,Ross,Here.
385,Rachel,Thank you.
386,Rachel,Now are you sure?
387,Rachel,"Because once I make a copy, there's no turning back."
388,Ross,"Yeah, I'm-I'm sure."
389,Ross,"Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind."
390,Joey,"Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?"
391,Ross,I've been back and forth.
392,Joey,"Yeah well, maybe you should go back!"
393,Joey,Okay?
394,Joey,"Rachel moves in, and before you know it you're right where you don't want to be!"
395,Joey,Back together!
396,Ross,"Ehh, I don't, I don't think so."
397,Ross,"She's already talked about y'know, dating other guys."
398,Joey,That's not gonna work out!
399,Joey,"Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, ""Oh that's okay."
400,Joey,"You'll find someone."""
401,Joey,"And then, bamn!"
402,Joey,She finds you!
403,Ross,"Yeah, well, m-maybe you're right."
404,Joey,"I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again!"
405,Joey,"Now, is that what you want?"
406,Ross,Is that what I want?
407,Phoebe,Yes.
408,Joey,Here she comes.
409,Joey,"Hold on, I'm gonna make your life much easier."
410,Rachel,"All right, well the place was closed."
411,Rachel,I'll just copy it later.
412,Joey,Or not.
413,Joey,"Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?"
414,Ross,Whoa!
415,Ross,Whoa!
416,Ross,"Whoa, Joey!"
417,Joey,"No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no It's okay, I mean Ilook Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday's thing, but we don't have to do that!"
418,Rachel,"Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall."
419,Rachel,"Wait a minute, unless you're thinking about Naked Wednesday's."
420,Joey,"Thursday's clearly not good for ya, pick a day!"
421,Joey,Commercial Break
422,Joey,Hi!
423,Joey,The Potential
424,Joey,Come in.
425,Joey,"Thanks for comin' back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!"
426,Joey,The Potential
427,Joey,"Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match."
428,Joey,"Okay, so I made up a little test."
429,Joey,"Now, I'm gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind."
430,Joey,The Potential
431,Joey,Okay!
432,Joey,Here we go.
433,Joey,Pillow.
434,Joey,The Potential

442,Joey,"No-no-no, so close though, butbye-bye!"
443,Joey,End
0,Joey,Previously on Friends.
1,Ross,"I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore."
2,Rachel,You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you've got a girlfriend?
3,Ross,Is this about Mark?
4,Rachel,Oh my God.
5,Ross,"Okay, it's not, it's not."
6,Rachel,Oh my God.
7,Rachel,I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross!
8,Rachel,"Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break."
9,Ross,"Fine, you're right."
10,Ross,"Let's ah, let's take a break,  let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yoghurt, or something.."
11,Rachel,No.
12,Rachel,A break from us.
13,Rachel,"Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break."
14,Ross,"I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?"
15,Ross,Who's that?
16,Rachel,Nobody.
17,Ross,Is that Mark?
18,Rachel,"Umm, honey, look he just came over to...."
19,Ross,Yeah!
20,Ross,Got it!
21,Monica,Hey.
22,Rachel,Hey.
23,Monica,How's the big anniversary dinner?
24,Rachel,"Well, we never actually got to dinner."
25,Monica,"Ohhh, nice."
26,Rachel,"No, we kinda broke up instead."
27,Monica,What?
28,Rachel,"God, Monica it's on the ceiling."
29,Monica,"That's okay, this is more important than fruit   on my ceiling!"
30,Monica,You broke up?
31,Rachel,"Yeah, but it's okay, because when Ross left Mark came over."
32,Monica,Oh no!
33,Rachel,No.
34,Monica,"Rachel, you and Mark?"
35,Rachel,"No, no-no, it's okay, calm down."
36,Rachel,"Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work."
37,Rachel,"Hi, it's me."
38,Rachel,I've been trying to reach you all night.
39,Rachel,I feel awful.
40,Rachel,"Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark."
41,Rachel,This whole break-up thing is just stupid.
42,Ross,Yeah!
43,Rachel,"Eh, I'm just so sorry I put you through it."
44,Rachel,"And, I y'know, I don't want to get back together over a machine."
45,Ross,Na-huh.
46,Rachel,"So, I love you."
47,Ross,I love you.

89,Phoebe,Waxine!
90,Monica,Yes!
91,Monica,Have you seen it?
92,Phoebe,"Oh, it's incredible!"
93,Phoebe,I so want to be a Waxine girl.
94,Monica,I know!
95,Phoebe,God.
96,Phoebe,Do think it really doesn't hurt?
97,Phoebe,Cause how can they do that?
98,Monica,Hello!
99,Monica,Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
100,Phoebe,They have the best stuff in there.
101,Chandler,Oh my God!
102,Chandler,Oh my God!
103,Joey,Yeah.
104,Joey,"We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel."
105,Joey,Which is probably what you shoulda done.
106,Joey,Huh?
107,Ross,You think?!
108,Ross,"God, I, ah, I'm in hell."
109,Ross,"I mean what, what am I gonna do?"
110,Ross,"Rachel's all like, I love you and, and let's work on this.'"
111,Ross,"And all I can think about is, What is she gonna do?"
112,Ross,What is she gonna say?'
113,Ross,when I tell her what I did.
114,Chandler,"Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question."
115,Chandler,How dumb are you?
116,Ross,What?!
117,Ross,"Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right."
118,Ross,"How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?"
119,Joey,"Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble."
120,Chandler,He's right.
121,Chandler,"Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her."
122,Joey,"Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild."
123,Ross,"Yeah, but don't you think...."
124,Chandler,"All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right."
125,Chandler,And that's what deathbeds are for.
126,Ross,"Yeah, okay."
127,Joey,"All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way."
128,Joey,Did you think about the trail?
129,Ross,What trail?
130,Joey,The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it!
131,Joey,You always have to think about the trail!
132,Ross,"Oh, I-I don't think there's any trail."
133,Chandler,"Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac."
134,Chandler,Issac's sister is Jasmine.
135,Chandler,And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe.
136,Chandler,And Phoebe's friends with Rachel.
137,Chandler,"And that's the trail, I did it!"
138,Phoebe,"After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,"
139,Monica,Did that!
140,Phoebe,Grasp one of the linen strips by its easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
141,Monica,Okay.
142,Monica,Ow!!!!!
143,Monica,Ow-oh-oh!
144,Phoebe,Was it not pain-free?
145,Monica,No.
146,Monica,It was painful.
147,Monica,"Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax."
148,Phoebe,"Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad."
149,Monica,That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid.
150,Monica,"But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest."
151,Phoebe,Ow-ow-ow-ow!
152,Phoebe,Oh my God!!
153,Monica,"Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?"
154,Ross,Chloe?
155,Ross,Hi..
156,Ross,You took my watch?
157,Ross,"Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?"
158,Ross,Exactly.
159,Ross,"So you didn't, didn't mention anything to Issac right?"
160,Ross,"You tell, of course you do."
161,Ross,Issac.
162,Ross,Issac.
163,Ross,"Hey, Issac."
164,Ross,"Issac, hi!"
165,Ross,Y'know we haven't actually met...
166,Ross,"Yes, I suppose I am a dog."
167,Ross,"But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend."
168,Ross,"Yeah, that's the one."
169,Ross,"Listen, I don't want to hurt her."
170,Ross,Yeah.
171,Ross,"Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?"
172,Ross,"Actually, no, we're not."
173,Ross,"No, we're not."
174,Ross,"No, we're not!"
175,Ross,Right.
176,Ross,Fine.
177,Ross,I just need to know that you're not gonna tell your sister.
178,Ross,Jasmine?
179,Ross,"We met at Phoebe's birthday party, I'm, I'm Ross Geller."
180,Ross,"Yes, I did."
181,Ross,Very bad.
182,Ross,I'm agreeing with you.
183,Ross,"Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?"
184,Ross,"Okay, Jasmine, please, please don't."
185,Ross,"I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her."
186,Ross,Okay?
187,Ross,"Thank you, thank you."
188,Ross,Who's your roommate?
189,Ross,Gunther!
190,Ross,Gunther.
191,Ross,"Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place."
192,Monica,Ow!
193,Phoebe,Oh!
194,Monica,Ow!!
195,Monica,Ow!
196,Phoebe,Ow!!!
197,Phoebe,Monica and
198,Phoebe,Ow!!!!!!!
199,Phoebe,Ow-ow-ow-ow!
200,Phoebe,We're all right.
201,Monica,"It's okay, it's okay."
202,Phoebe,We're all right.
203,Monica,We were just waxing our legs.
204,Chandler,Off?!
205,Phoebe,"For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience."
206,Chandler,"Yeah, well I don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely."
207,Joey,"Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all."
208,Joey,"I mean, come on, it's just a little wax."
209,Phoebe,"Oh yeah, come here."
210,Chandler,"Oh, that's mature."
211,Joey,"Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?"
212,Phoebe,Uh-huh.
213,Monica,That's right.
214,Ross,"Come on, Rachel, come on!"
215,Ross,Talk to me!
216,Ross,Please!
217,Rachel,I can't talk to you.
218,Rachel,I can't even look at you right now!
219,Monica,What?
220,Chandler,"Nothing, nothing."
221,Monica,Rachel said everything was okay.
222,Phoebe,"What, what are they talking about?"
223,Ross,Rachel?
224,Rachel,Just get away from me!
225,Ross,"No, it was a mistake!"
226,Ross,I made a mistake!
227,Ross,Okay?
228,Rachel,A mistake?!
229,Rachel,What were you trying to put it in?
230,Rachel,Her purse?
231,Phoebe,Whe-where did he put it?
232,Rachel,"Ross, you had sex with another woman!"
233,Monica,Oh my God.
234,Phoebe,"Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday."
235,Chandler,"Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk...."
236,Monica,Oh!!
237,Monica,You guys knew about this and you didn't tell us?
238,Chandler,"He has sex, and we get hit in our heads."
239,Rachel,"Y'know what, I want you to leave!"
240,Rachel,Get outta here!
241,Ross,No!
242,Rachel,Just get out!
243,Rachel,Now!
244,Ross,No!!
245,Ross,No!!
246,Ross,I wanna stay.
247,Ross,I wanna talk about this.
248,Rachel,Okay!
249,Rachel,All right!
250,Rachel,How was she?
251,Chandler,Uh-oh.
252,Ross,What?
253,Rachel,Was she good?
254,Joey,Don't answer that.
255,Rachel,Come on Ross!
256,Rachel,"You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!!"
257,Rachel,How was she?
258,Ross,She was...
259,Joey,Awful!
260,Joey,Horrible!
261,Chandler,She was not good.
262,Chandler,Not good.
263,Joey,She was nothing compared to you.
264,Ross,"She, she was different."
265,Joey,Ewwwww!
266,Chandler,Uh-oh.
267,Rachel,Good different?
268,Ross,Nobody likes change.
269,Ross,What?
270,Ross,"Okay, okay, okay, okay."
271,Phoebe,Should we do something?
272,Chandler,"Yeah, never cheat on Rachel."
273,Ross,"I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry."
274,Ross,"I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible."
275,Rachel,Whoa!!
276,Rachel,"Whoa, whoa, wait a minute."
277,Rachel,What time did your little friend leave?
278,Rachel,Oh my God.
279,Rachel,She was there?
280,Rachel,She was still there?
281,Rachel,"She was in there, when I was in there?"
282,Ross,Listen.
283,Ross,"Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!"
284,Rachel,And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!
285,Ross,"Look, I didn't think there was a relationship to jeopardise."
286,Ross,I thought we were broken up.
287,Rachel,We were on a break!
288,Ross,"That, for all I knew would, could last forever."
289,Ross,That to me is a break-up.
290,Rachel,You think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality?
291,Ross,"Look, I'm not trying to get out of anything, okay."
292,Ross,I thought our relationship was dead!
293,Rachel,"Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!"
294,Joey,"Y'know what, I don't think we should listen to this anymore."
295,Monica,"What, what are you doing?"
296,Monica,You can't go out there.
297,Joey,Why not?!
298,Joey,I'm hungry.
299,Monica,Because they'll know we've been listening.
300,Rachel,God!
301,Rachel,And to have to hear about it from Gunther!
302,Ross,Come on!
303,Ross,"Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!"
304,Rachel,"Oh, that is so sweet."
305,Rachel,I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
306,Chandler,"Y'know what, I think we can go out there."
307,Chandler,I mean they have more important things to worry about.
308,Joey,"Yeah, we'll be fine."
309,Ross,"Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to."
310,Chandler,"Wax the door shut, we're never leaving, ever."
311,Phoebe,"Hi, it's Phoebe."
312,Phoebe,Listen someone's gonna have to take my
313,Ross,Don't you realise none of this would've ever happened if I didn't think at that same moment you weren't having sex with Mark?
314,Rachel,All right.
315,Rachel,Let's say I had slept with Mark.
316,Rachel,Would you have been able to forgive me?
317,Ross,Yes I would.
318,Rachel,"You'd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?"
319,Ross,Yes.
320,Rachel,"You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were...."
321,Ross,La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!
322,Ross,"Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you."
323,Ross,"Because it's, I mean it's you."
324,Ross,What?
325,Ross,"Come on Rach, tell me what you're thinking?"
326,Rachel,"I'm thinking, I'm gonna order a pizza."
327,Ross,"Order a pizza like, I forgive you?'"
328,Joey,"Oh man, pizza?"
329,Joey,I like pizza.
330,Joey,Put olives on the pizza.
331,Phoebe,We could eat the wax!
332,Phoebe,It's organic.
333,Chandler,"Oh great, food with hair on it."
334,Phoebe,"No, not the used wax."
335,Chandler,Because that would be crazy?
336,Ross,"Hey, can I, can I get in on that?"
337,Ross,Because I'm kinda hungry myself.
338,Rachel,Fine.
339,Rachel,Hi!
340,Rachel,"Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza."
341,Ross,No anchovies.
342,Rachel,"With ah, extra anchovies."
343,Ross,"That's okay, I'll just pick em off."
344,Rachel,"Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?"
345,Ross,"You can have the last piece, if you want."
346,Rachel,"Well, I should think so."
347,Rachel,You slept with someone.
348,Rachel,"[Cut to Monica's bedroom, they're all eating the wax, Chandler and Phoebe, don't like it."
349,Rachel,Joey tries some and makes a face
350,Phoebe,"They're gonna get through this, aren't they?"
351,Chandler,"Yeah, come on, it's Ross and Rachel, they've got too."
352,Monica,What if they don't?
353,Joey,You think I need a new walk?
354,Chandler,What?
355,Joey,"Well y'know, I've been walking the same way since high school."
356,Joey,"Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice."
357,Joey,I think I need a take notice' walk.
358,Chandler,Are you actually saying these words?
359,Ross,"What, now you're not even taking to me?"
360,Ross,"Look Rachel, I-I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry, I was out of my mind."
361,Ross,"I thought I'd lost you, I didn't know what to do."
362,Ross,Come on!
363,Ross,"Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this?"
364,Ross,Huh?
365,Ross,"I-I don't cheat right, I, that's not me, I'm not Joey!"
366,Joey,Whoa-ho-ho!
367,Joey,"Yeah, okay."
368,Monica,Hey.
369,Monica,It's three in the morning.
370,Monica,They don't know that I've come home yet.
371,Monica,You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
372,Phoebe,"Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved."
373,Ross,"Y'know what, y'know what, I'm-I'm not the one that wanted that, that break, okay."
374,Ross,You're the one that bailed on us.
375,Ross,"You're the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!"
376,Rachel,That's....
377,Ross,That's what?
378,Rachel,That is neither here nor there.
379,Ross,"Okay, well here we are."
380,Ross,"Now we're in a tough spot again, Rach."
381,Ross,What do you want to do?
382,Ross,How do you want to handle it?
383,Ross,Huh?
384,Ross,Do you wanna fight for us?
385,Ross,"Or, do you wanna bail?"
386,Ross,"Look, I,  I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing."
387,Ross,Okay?
388,Ross,"And I'm sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can't."
389,Ross,I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good.
390,Ross,"Rachel, I love you so much."
391,Rachel,No Ross!!
392,Rachel,Don't!
393,Rachel,"You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, okay?"
394,Rachel,It doesn't work that way.
395,Rachel,It doesn't just make it better.
396,Rachel,Okay?
397,Ross,"Okay, okay, okay."
398,Rachel,I think you should go.
399,Ross,What?
400,Rachel,I really think you need to go now.
401,Ross,"Okay, okay."
402,Ross,This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn't work past it together...
403,Rachel,"Yeah, what the hell did I know!"
404,Ross,"Look, look, there's got to be a way we can work past this."
405,Ross,"Okay,  I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you."
406,Ross,"Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart."
407,Ross,"Your good heart Rach,  and, and...."
408,Rachel,No.
409,Rachel,"I can't, you're a totally different person to me now."
410,Rachel,"I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever."
411,Rachel,"God, and now I just can't stop picturing with her, I can't,  it doesn't matter what you say, or what you do, Ross."
412,Rachel,"It's just changed, everything."
413,Rachel,Forever.
414,Ross,"Yeah, but this can't be it, I mean."
415,Rachel,Then how come it is?
416,Rachel,Closing Credits
417,Phoebe,They've been quiet for a long time.
418,Joey,Maybe she killed him?
419,Chandler,Let's go.
420,Chandler,Is that your new walk?
421,Joey,"No, I really have to pee."
422,Joey,End
0,Rachel,"Mom, would you relax."
1,Rachel,"That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that."
2,Rachel,"Mom, c'mon, stop worrying."
3,Rachel,"This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing  OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go."
4,Rachel,"OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you."
5,Rachel,"OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy."
6,Rachel,"Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh."
7,Rachel,It's open you guys.
8,Rachel,"Hi, hi can I help you?"
9,Rachel,"Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her."
10,Rachel,What?
11,Joey,"This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?"
12,Phoebe,"Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card."
13,Monica,I can't believe you married Duncan.
14,Monica,I mean how could you not tell me?
15,Monica,"We lived together, we told each other everything."
16,Phoebe,"I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve."
17,Monica,"Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay."
18,Monica,"I mean, what the hell were you thinking?"
19,Ross,"You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental."
20,Phoebe,"OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend."
21,Monica,"Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger."
22,Monica,"Well, didn't you?"
23,Phoebe,I might have.
24,Monica,I can't believe you didn't tell me.
25,Phoebe,"Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything."
26,Monica,What have I not told you?
27,Phoebe,"Oh, I don't know."
28,Phoebe,"Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace."
29,Rachel,What!
30,Monica,"Wait a minute, who told you?"
31,Monica,You are dead meat.
32,Chandler,I didn't know it was a big secret.
33,Monica,"Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple."
34,Phoebe,You have a third nipple?
35,Chandler,You bitch.
36,Ross,"Whip it out, whip it out."
37,Chandler,"C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless."
38,Rachel,"Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?"
39,Joey,I can't believe you.
40,Joey,You told me it was a nubbin.
41,Ross,"Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?"
42,Joey,"I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was."
43,Joey,Let me see it again.
44,Chandler,Joey was in a porno movie.
45,Chandler,"If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me."
46,Ross,You were in a porno?
47,Joey,"Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK."
48,Joey,But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.
49,Monica,That is wild.
50,Ross,So what's it shaped like?
51,Phoebe,"Yeah, is there a hair on it?"
52,Joey,What happens if you flick it?
53,Ross,"So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?"
54,Chandler,"Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia."
55,Chandler,Huh?
56,Chandler,"Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?"
57,Ross,"You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?"
58,Rachel,"Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special."
59,Monica,"Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did."
60,Monica,But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.
61,Rachel,"Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it."
62,Rachel,"God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it."
63,Joey,Foxy lady.
64,Phoebe,"Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades."
65,Joey,The Ice Capades?
66,Chandler,"No, no the gravel capades."
67,Chandler,"Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls."
68,Chandler,funny.
69,Monica,I can't believe you're dressing up for him.
70,Monica,"I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again."
71,Phoebe,"OK, no."
72,Phoebe,For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me.
73,Phoebe,"OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband."
74,Ross,"Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk."
75,Ross,"Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?"
76,Chandler,"Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing."
77,Chandler,Ha ha ha ha.
78,Ross,"OK sweetie, I'll see you later."
79,Rachel,Bye-bye Julie.
80,Rachel,Hey.
81,Ross,Hey.
82,Rachel,"Hey, c'mon, cut it out."
83,Ross,Hey?
84,Rachel,What?
85,Ross,Can I ask you somethin'?
86,Rachel,Sure.
87,Ross,Naa.
88,Rachel,What?
89,Rachel,"C'mon, talk to me."
90,Ross,"OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex?"
91,Rachel,Why?
92,Rachel,Who's not having.
93,Rachel,"Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?"
94,Ross,"Technically, huh, no."
95,Rachel,Wow.
96,Rachel,"Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed."
97,Rachel,"Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?"
98,Ross,"No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything."
99,Ross,"I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh."
100,Rachel,"No, no no no, don't need to know the details."
101,Ross,"It's just, it's, it's me."
102,Ross,"You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian."

106,Ross,What?
107,Rachel,I think it's sexy.
108,Ross,Sexy?
109,Rachel,Let me tell you something.
110,Rachel,As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex.
111,Ross,No kidding?
112,Rachel,Oh yeah.
113,Rachel,In fact you know what I'd do?
114,Ross,What?
115,Rachel,I'd wait.
116,Ross,You'd wait?
117,Rachel,"Yes, absolutely."
118,Rachel,I would wait and wait.

120,Ross,Really?
121,Rachel,"Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man."
122,Rachel,That just means it's working.

148,Ross,"Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey."
149,Rachel,"What did, what did he say?"
150,Ross,"Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know."
151,Ross,"So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so."
152,Chandler,What's this in my pocket?
153,Chandler,Why it's Joey's porno movie.
154,Ross,Pop it in.
155,Joey,"I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people."
156,Rachel,"Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see."
157,Ross,What's wrong with people having sex?
158,Rachel,"Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females."
159,Rachel,"And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering."
160,Rachel,"And, Monica help me out here."
161,Monica,"Hell, I wanna see Joey."
162,Chandler,"OK, now wait a minute."
163,Chandler,That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
164,Monica,"All I say is, she better get the job."
165,Ross,Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
166,Joey,"Shh, OK, here I come, here I come."
167,Joey,"See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do."
168,Joey,so I just watch 'em have sex.
169,Joey,"And then I say, wait, here's my line,  you know that's bad fo r the paper tray."

182,Phoebe,"I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties."
183,Phoebe,So how long have you known?
184,Phoebe,"And um, and there's actually a, a woman?"
185,Phoebe,Oh.
186,Phoebe,"Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?"
187,Phoebe,Sure.
188,Phoebe,"I, I don't know what to say."
189,Phoebe,"I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'"
190,Phoebe,Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?
191,Monica,"You know, it still smells like monkey in there."
192,Chandler,"Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped."
193,Joey,"Me too, we should get goin'."
194,Rachel,"No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty."
195,Rachel,"Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore."
196,Monica,"Rachel, that's all we do."
197,Rachel,"Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?"
198,Rachel,"Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you."
199,Rachel,"I mean, who is Julie?"
200,Rachel,"I mean, what do you like, what don't you like?"
201,Rachel,We wanna hear everything.
202,Rachel,So.
203,Rachel,"I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?"
204,Chandler,I got the time to get to know Julie.
205,Joey,I got time.
206,Monica,"Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go?"
207,Monica,That's fine.
208,Rachel,"OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?"
209,Rachel,"Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh."
210,Phoebe,"So, um, have you told your parents?"
211,Phoebe,Here you go.
212,Phoebe,"You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who."
213,Phoebe,"no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't th ink either answer would make me feel better."
214,Phoebe,So your brother's straigh huh?
215,Phoebe,Seriously.
216,Rachel,"Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?"
217,Chandler,I'm goin' home.
218,Rachel,What?
219,Joey,"Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?"
220,Ross,Goodnight.
221,Rachel,"So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on."
222,Ross,"Oh, no no, I am."
223,Rachel,"Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?"
224,Ross,"Um, no, I uh, I have done it before."
225,Rachel,"Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it."
226,Rachel,"I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?"
227,Ross,"I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens."
228,Ross,"Wha, uhh, what?"
229,Rachel,"Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from."
230,Ross,"OK, now I'm nervous."
231,Rachel,Maybe you should put it off.
232,Ross,"No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy."
233,Ross,"You know, I mean, really happy."
234,Ross,"I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know."
235,Rachel,"I know, yeah, sorry."
236,Ross,"What, it's not your fault."
237,Rachel,"Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough."
238,Rachel,"I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing."
239,Rachel,"I mean, women really like that."
240,Ross,Really?
241,Rachel,"Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen."
242,Ross,Uh-huh.
243,Rachel,"And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you."
244,Rachel,"And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening."
245,Ross,Ohh.
246,Ross,"Thanks Rach, goodnight."
247,Rachel,"Ohh, God."
248,Rachel,CLOSING CREDITS

5,Rachel,IWow.
6,Rachel,"My God, so creamy."
7,Rachel,"Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had."
8,Rachel,Where did you get this?
9,Chandler,It was at the front door.
10,Chandler,When I got home.
11,Chandler,Somebody sent it to us.
12,Rachel,"Chandler, this is not addressed to you."
13,Rachel,This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs.
14,Rachel,Thief.
15,Chandler,Ino!
16,Chandler,I didn't read the box before I opened it.
17,Chandler,And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
18,Rachel,"Why, why not?"
19,Chandler,Because it's too delicious.
20,Rachel,"Chandler, you stole this cheesecake."
21,Rachel,That is wrong.
22,Chandler,No-no-no!
23,Chandler,"It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win!"
24,Chandler,"The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate,  Momma's Little Bakery."
25,Chandler,"I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person."
26,Rachel,"Oh, I'm sorry what?"
27,Rachel,Opening Credits
28,Joey,"All right, I should get going, big day a work."
29,Joey,Y'know I'm in a coma?
30,Joey,"Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I'm not brain dead."
31,Chandler,So
32,Joey,"Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it's just not my character that's not brain dead."
33,Joey,"Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?"

40,Ross,"Wow, did not know that!"
41,Ross,May I say how lovely you look today?
42,Phoebe,Duly noted.
43,Ross,Thanks.
44,Ross,Oh!
45,Ross,"So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?"
46,Monica,What are you talking about?
47,Ross,"Cousin Frannie's wedding, its tomorrow night."
48,Monica,You were invited?
49,Ross,No.
50,Monica,"My God, I can't believe this!"
51,Monica,"I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it!"
52,Monica,I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
53,Chandler,"Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends."
54,Ross,"Well l-look okay, it's probably just a mistake."
55,Ross,Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay?
56,Ross,Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
57,Monica,"Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay?"
58,Monica,"And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too."
59,Ross,"Y'know, she tried to undress me too."
60,Chandler,I used to undress my cousin Glenn.
61,Phoebe,Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!
62,Rachel,"Umm, I think he's still out."
63,Rachel,What's wrong?
64,Phoebe,"Well, I'll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note."
65,Rachel,"""Pheebs, can't make it, got a date."
66,Rachel,Talk to you later.
67,Rachel,"Big Daddy."""
68,Rachel,Big Daddy?
69,Phoebe,Oh that's a nickname we were trying out.
70,Ross,"Hey, y'know what nickname never caught on?"
71,Ross,The Ross-A-Tron!
72,Joey,Hey!
73,Phoebe,Oh!
74,Phoebe,Here's Joseph Francis!
75,Joey,Oh-Wha-Ho!
76,Joey,What are you middle naming me for?!
77,Joey,I left you a note!
78,Phoebe,So what?!
79,Phoebe,That doesn't give you the right to ditch me!
80,Joey,"Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!"
81,Ross,"Phoebe he's right, that is the rule."
82,Phoebe,I don't accept this rule.
83,Phoebe,"When me make plans, I expect you to show up."
84,Phoebe,"Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time til you meet someone better!"
85,Phoebe,"Y'know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this  is for life!"
86,Joey,Wow!
87,Joey,I'm so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
88,Phoebe,"Well, it does."
89,Joey,"Okay, can I-can I make it up to you?"
90,Joey,Huh?
91,Joey,I'm sorry.
92,Joey,"How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?!"
93,Joey,I'll pay for myself!
94,Phoebe,"Okay, you wore me down."
95,Ross,"Hey Joe, while you're over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?"
96,Joey,The RossIs that back?!
97,Rachel,Hi!
98,Chandler,Another cheesecake came!
99,Chandler,They delivered it to the wrong address again!
100,Rachel,"So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?"
101,Chandler,I can't seem to say goodbye.
102,Rachel,Are you serious?!
103,Rachel,"Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?"
104,Chandler,Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?
105,Rachel,It was cheesecake.
106,Rachel,It was fine.
107,Rachel,"It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling  Wow!"
108,Rachel,My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
109,Chandler,Y'know what?
110,Chandler,Forget it!
111,Chandler,We are just hungry!
112,Chandler,We have not had lunch!
113,Chandler,We are just light-headed!
114,Chandler,So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
115,Rachel,Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
116,Chandler,Good idea.
117,Chandler,Where do you want to go to lunch?
118,Rachel,"Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois."
119,Joey,Awww!
120,Joey,Mel Torme died.
121,Monica,"Joey, that paper's like a year old!"
122,Joey,Aw!
123,Joey,Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale is over?
124,Ross,Hey.
125,Joey,Hey.
126,Monica,Hey.
127,Ross,So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn't a mistake.
128,Ross,"Ahh, there's-there's limited seating in the hall."
129,Monica,Limited seating?!
130,Monica,I am just one tiny person!
131,Ross,"Well yeah, but she doesn't know that."
132,Ross,"I mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling."
133,Monica,Limited seating!
134,Monica,"Oh, that is such a lame excuse!"
135,Monica,That's not the reason she's not inviting me!
136,Ross,Oh what's the big deal?!
137,Ross,"I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception."
138,Ross,And-and y'know what?
139,Ross,"If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we'll-we'll leave early as a sign of protest."
140,Monica,Joan?
141,Ross,"Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date."
142,Ross,She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department.
143,Ross,"Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!"
144,Monica,"Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?!"
145,Monica,"I wasn't invited and you got ""and guest?!"""
146,Joey,"Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross's behalf."
147,Joey,"I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back"
148,Ross,Not broad backed!
149,Monica,"Wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me!"
150,Ross,What?
151,Ross,I can't cancel on Joan!
152,Monica,Why not?
153,Ross,BecDid you not hear me?!
154,Ross,"She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay?"
155,Ross,They're wild!
156,Ross,Why do you want to come anyway?
157,Monica,Because!
158,Monica,She's my cousin.
159,Monica,"I mean, we grew up together!"
160,Monica,We're family y'know?
161,Monica,Well that's important to me.
162,Ross,"Okay, all right, I'll take you."
163,Ross,I'll go call Joan.
164,Joey,Aww that's nice.
165,Joey,"Family should be there, huh?"
166,Joey,"This is her wedding, happiest day of her life."
167,Monica,We'll see.
168,Chandler,"Well, thank you for lunch."
169,Rachel,What?
170,Rachel,"Wait a minute, I didn't pay, I thought you paid!"
171,Chandler,So apparently we just don't pay for food anymore.
172,Chandler,Do you see what I see?
173,Rachel,Its still there!
174,Chandler,Mrs. Braverman must be out.
175,Rachel,She could be out of town.
176,Rachel,Maybe she'll be gone for months.
177,Chandler,"By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad."
178,Chandler,We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
179,Rachel,No that could kill her.
180,Chandler,"Well, we don't want that."
181,Rachel,No so we're protecting her.
182,Chandler,But we should take it.
183,Rachel,But we should move quick.
184,Chandler,Why?
185,Rachel,Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
186,Chandler,Go!
187,Chandler,Go!
188,Chandler,Go!
189,Chandler,Go!
190,Chandler,Go!

199,Phoebe,"David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!"
200,Phoebe,"Oh, you say someone's name enough, they turn around."
201,Phoebe,David!
202,Phoebe,What-what are you doing here?
203,Phoebe,Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?
204,Phoebe,Well Yeah.
205,Phoebe,You look great too.
206,Phoebe,Did you get a haircut?
207,Phoebe,Yeah.
208,Phoebe,Uh-huh.

210,Phoebe,II think about you all the time.

212,Phoebe,Uh-huh.
213,Phoebe,Yeah.
214,Phoebe,Yes!
215,Phoebe,Oh no!
216,Phoebe,I can't.
217,Phoebe,"I can't believe I have plans, I can't."
218,Phoebe,Can you do it tomorrow night though?
219,Monica,"Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?"
220,Phoebe,Uh-huh.
221,Monica,What are you doing?
222,Phoebe,"Well, I have plans with Joey tonight."
223,Monica,So!
224,Monica,He'll understand!
225,Phoebe,No he won't.
226,Phoebe,And that's not even the point!
227,Phoebe,"Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends!"
228,Phoebe,And now y'know what?
229,Phoebe,"Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?!"
230,Phoebe,I should change beliefs!
231,Phoebe,No!
232,Phoebe,No!
233,Phoebe,"No, if I don't have my principles, I don't have anything!"
234,Monica,"God, you are so strong."
235,Phoebe,Or!
236,Phoebe,I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at
237,Rachel,Oh my God!
238,Rachel,That is so good!
239,Chandler,"I'm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I'll regret it."

241,Rachel,Hey!
242,Joey,What do you got there?
243,Rachel,"Oh it's umm, it's tofu cake."

257,Chandler,That's what Monica said.
258,Joey,After she gave me that big speech?!
259,Joey,She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me?
260,Joey,I think she's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
261,Ross,"Oh here, I think this is us."

302,Joey,Y'know-y'know what I really want?
303,Phoebe,What?
304,Joey,"Is to have a long, long talk."

315,Joey,"Whoa-whoa, what is it?"
316,Phoebe,Well It's a date.
317,Joey,A date?!
318,Joey,"No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn't schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!"
319,Phoebe,"Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this."
320,Joey,"No, I'm gonna!!"
321,Joey,That's right!
322,Joey,"Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin' out with that girl!"
323,Joey,Like-like-like I did something terrible to you!
324,Joey,"And now Pheebs, you're doing the same thing!"
325,Phoebe,ThatIt's not the same thing!
326,Phoebe,This is totally different!
327,Phoebe,This is with David!
328,Phoebe,"Remember David, the scientist guy?"
329,Phoebe,"Okay, he's very special to me."
330,Joey,"Okay, well my girl from the other night was special."
331,Joey,She was a scientist too!
332,Phoebe,She was?
333,Joey,"Well, she graduated from high school!"
334,Phoebe,"Okay, whatever."
335,Phoebe,Y'know what?

352,Rachel,"Oh, what are you going to do?!"
353,Rachel,Are you gonna go run tell Monica?!
354,Rachel,Are you gonna tell Joey?!
355,Rachel,No!
356,Rachel,Because then you will have to tell them what we did!
357,Rachel,We are desert stealers!
358,Rachel,We are living outside the law!
359,Chandler,Y'know what?
360,Chandler,I don't trust you with this cake anymore!

374,Chandler,"Well that's not fair, you've already had some!"
375,Rachel,What?
376,Rachel,"Oh, well then y'know what?"
377,Rachel,I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
378,Chandler,What do we use to split it?
379,Rachel,Okay!
380,Rachel,"All right, pick a half."
381,Chandler,"Okay well, this side looks bigger."
382,Chandler,Uh There's more crust on this side.

384,Chandler,"So, maybe if I measured"
385,Rachel,Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
386,Chandler,"All right, I'll pick that one."
387,Rachel,That's also the smaller piece.

410,Ross,"Now wait a minute, you be nice!"
411,Ross,All right?
412,Ross,I didn't bring you here so you can ambush her.
413,Monica,Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.
414,Ross,That bitch!
415,Monica,Am I doing here?
416,Monica,Why?
417,Monica,Surprised to see me?
418,Monica,Ross brought me.
419,Monica,How do you like that?
420,Ross,"Hi Frannie, congratulations."
421,Monica,"You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?!"
422,Monica,Why?!
423,Monica,WhatWhy wouldn't you want me at your wedding?
424,Monica,What could I have possibly done?!
425,Monica,Stuart!
426,Ross,So it's really a question of who could you have possibly done.
427,Phoebe,Are you sure?
428,Phoebe,I'll bet there's another flight to Minsk in like
429,Phoebe,That's really beautiful.

433,Phoebe,You're right!
434,Phoebe,You're right.
435,Phoebe,Don't say it.
436,Phoebe,I do too.

439,Phoebe,You can yell at me tomorrow.
440,Joey,No!
441,Joey,No!
442,Joey,"No Pheebs, I'm not gonna yell at you."
443,Joey,"I just y'know, started thinking about you and David and Iremember how bummed you were the first time he left."
444,Joey,"And I just Oh Pheebs, come here."
445,Joey,Are you okay?
446,Phoebe,No I'm not okay.
447,Phoebe,The only guy I've ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may neverI may never see him again.
448,Joey,"Hey, y'know you could always visit him."
449,Phoebe,"Oh right, like they're gonna let me have a passport."
450,Joey,Anything I can do?
451,Joey,Whatever you need.
452,Phoebe,"WellButNow, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y'know before he does, then he can come back."
453,Joey,I can give it a shot.
454,Rachel,Oh!
455,Rachel,Yay!
456,Rachel,Look!
457,Rachel,There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!

2,Rachel,Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
3,Monica,Oh my God!
4,Phoebe,Wow!
5,Joey,What is the matter with you?
6,Phoebe,No!
7,Phoebe,Barry and Mindy.
8,Joey,"Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross."
9,Joey,Who-who's Barry and Mindy?
10,Rachel,Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
11,Joey,"Ohh-oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her?"
12,Rachel,"Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me."
13,Monica,Why did they get divorced?
14,Rachel,"Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else."
15,Rachel,Isn't that sad?
16,Rachel,"God, could you imagine if I actually married him?!"
17,Rachel,I mean how different would my life be?
18,Ross,"I know what you mean, I've always wondered how different my life would be if-if I'd never gotten divorced."
19,Phoebe,Which time?
20,Ross,The first time!
21,Ross,"No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian."
22,Joey,I can't.
23,Joey,I keep seeing it the good way.
24,Ross,I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay.
25,Ross,"Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical."
26,Chandler,Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
27,Monica,And what if I was still fat?
28,Monica,"Well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure."
29,Chandler,Sure I would!
30,Chandler,"What, you guys really think that I'm that shallow?"
31,Ross,"No, I just think Monica was that fat."
32,Joey,"Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives!"
33,Joey,"Oh-hey, there's Carol again!"
34,Chandler,What if I had had the guts to quit my job?
35,Chandler,"I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny."
36,Chandler,But my job's fun too!
37,Chandler,"I mean tomorrow, I-I don't have to wear a tie."
38,Phoebe,What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
39,Ross,What?
40,Rachel,Merrill Lynch?
41,Phoebe,"Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks."
42,Rachel,Well why didn't you take the job?
43,Phoebe,"Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true."
44,Phoebe,"So I thought y'know that if I'd work with stocks, I'd have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox."
45,Ross,"Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we'd still hang out?"

112,Joey,Really?
113,Chandler,Ehh.
114,Monica,"Maybe Joey doesn't have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?"
115,Joey,That's an idea!
116,Joey,"Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?"
117,Monica,No Joey!
118,Monica,Chandler could be your assistant!

120,Joey,That's great!
121,Joey,That would be great!
122,Joey,Let's do that!

277,Phoebe,It never happened.
278,Monica,Sorry.
279,Monica,So how's it going with Joey?

318,Joey,No pulp.
319,Joey,Pulp isn't juice.
320,Joey,"All juice, okay?"
321,Chandler,"I'm sorry, I guess I just like the pulp."
322,Joey,"Oh my God, I'm sorry, I'm being so rude."
323,Joey,"Rachel, would like a soda or something?"

345,Ross,"Well I don't know umm,  what if we were too tie each other up?"
346,Ross,"Umm, some people eat stuff off one another."

348,Ross,"Umm, y'know we-we could try dirty talk?"
349,Ross,"Umm, we could, we could have a threesome."

378,Joey,Congratulations!
379,Joey,What's the story?
380,Chandler,"Oh you wouldn't uh, care."
381,Chandler,It's just a stupid comic book story.
382,Joey,Are you kidding me?!
383,Joey,I love Archie!
384,Joey,And the whole gang!
385,Chandler,"Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money."
386,Chandler,So Reggie hires him as his assistas his butler.
387,Chandler,And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them.
388,Joey,Wait a minute.
389,Joey,That sounds a little familiar!

403,Rachel,Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit!
404,Rachel,Y'know I just wish we could be like on a break!
405,Monica,"Well, you're not."
406,Rachel,"Oh, it's so easy for you I mean, you're not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!"

430,Rachel,There shouldn't be all this rules and restrictions!
431,Rachel,"Y'know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever"
432,Monica,Rachel!
433,Monica,I'm never gonna think it's okay for you to cheat on your husband!
434,Rachel,Oh what do you know?
435,Rachel,Virgin!
436,Monica,"Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?"
437,Phoebe,"Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects."
438,Monica,Phoebe!
439,Monica,Put that cigarette out!
440,Phoebe,No!
441,Phoebe,It's not a cigarette!
442,Phoebe,The smoke is coming out of me!

459,Phoebe,Did he yell?
460,Ross,"J-j-just relax, nobody yelled."
461,Ross,Jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better.
462,Phoebe,Thank God.
463,Ross,"Yeah, she's fired."

495,Phoebe,"What the hell is this, herbal tea?"
496,Phoebe,I hate herbal tea!
497,Monica,"But, I put some honey in it."
498,Ross,"She doesn't know she was fired yet, does she?"
499,Chandler,"No, the doctors say it may kill her."
500,Phoebe,What are you two girls whispering about over there?
501,Chandler,But I think we should tell her.
502,Ross,"Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job."
503,Phoebe,"Okay, what is this?"
504,Phoebe,A stupid contest?
505,Phoebe,Because we got a winner here!
506,Chandler,"Listen Phoebe, he's right."
507,Chandler,People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
508,Phoebe,I know!
509,Phoebe,"But if I didn't work there, what else would I do?"
510,Monica,"Well, you used to like playing the guitar."
511,Phoebe,Yeah that was lucrative!
512,Phoebe,Smart like your brother!
513,Chandler,"Uh, what about y'know the massage thing?"
514,Chandler,That never gave you a heart attack.
515,Phoebe,"Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump changeooh, what do I do?!"
516,Phoebe,What will I do?
517,Rachel,"Ohh, I mean it's just so realistic!"
518,Joey,I know.
519,Joey,"Yeah, his name is Pat."
520,Rachel,Pat the dog.
521,Rachel,Oh!

526,Rachel,Oh!
527,Rachel,Wow!
528,Rachel,It's like it's raining!
529,Joey,"Pretty cool, huh?"
530,Joey,"But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong."
531,Rachel,"Umm, can I use your bathroom?"
532,Joey,"It's uh, right through there."
533,Rachel,Okay.
534,Rachel,"God y'know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani's apartment"
535,Joey,"Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?"
536,Rachel,"Yeah, it sure is!"
537,Monica,"I hope you're hungry, we're starting with oysters."
538,Monica,"And y'know what they say about oysters, don't you?"
539,Monica,Dr.
540,Monica,No!
541,Monica,"Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac."

551,Monica,It's sensual!
552,Monica,Dr.
553,Monica,Okay!
554,Monica,Ohhh no!
555,Monica,Dr.

558,Ross,"Y'know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at"
559,Ross,Okay.
560,Ross,I'm-I'm Ross by the way.
561,Ross,How hot is this?
562,Chandler,I'm sorry you're here with me instead of Roger.
563,Monica,"Yeah, me too."
564,Chandler,"Well, I could make it seem like he's here."
565,Chandler,"""Here's some little known facts about cous-cous."
566,Chandler,"They didn't add the second cous until 1979."""
567,Monica,Stop it!!
568,Monica,That's not funny!
569,Chandler,Okay.
570,Monica,"I'm sorry, okay?"
571,Monica,"It justtonight was supposed to be y'know, it was supposed to be a big deal."
572,Chandler,What was tonight?
573,Monica,You don't want to know what tonight was.
574,Chandler,Okay.
575,Chandler,What was tonight?
576,Monica,"Well, tonight waswas going to be my first time."

582,Chandler,Four different women!
583,Chandler,I've had sex way more times!
584,Monica,How many?
585,Chandler,Nine.
586,Monica,I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
587,Chandler,"Well good, good for you."
588,Chandler,You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
589,Monica,No.
590,Monica,He's not a horrible guy.
591,Chandler,Hey that's what I tell girls about me.
592,Monica,"Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!"
593,Chandler,No you are not!
594,Chandler,You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
595,Monica,Oh really?
596,Monica,When?
597,Monica,Do you wanna do it with me?
598,Chandler,Okay.
599,Monica,I was kidding.
600,Chandler,So was I.
601,Rachel,"Joey, you're such an amazing actor!"
602,Rachel,How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
603,Joey,"Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say."
604,Joey,"And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own."
605,Rachel,Wow!
606,Rachel,Tell me something JoeyWhoa!
607,Rachel,I just fell right off the couch there.
608,Joey,Yeah you did.
609,Rachel,Okay.
610,Joey,Here you go.
611,Joey,Let me ask you a question.
612,Rachel,Yeah?
613,Joey,When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
614,Rachel,Wow!
615,Rachel,"I can't, I can't feel my hands."
616,Joey,"Come, come here."
617,Chandler,We can't do this.
618,Monica,No!
619,Monica,Oyster?
620,Chandler,Yeah!
621,Chandler,"If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y'know?"
622,Chandler,Because you've been waiting a very long time and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
623,Monica,Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too.
624,Monica,"So even if you're horrible, how would I know?"
625,Chandler,I do like that.
626,Monica,It's harder for me!
627,Monica,I have those four other women to compete with!
628,Chandler,"Well, if it helps there were only three."
629,Chandler,"So it would just be for tonight, right?"
630,Monica,Absolutely!
631,Monica,It would just be one friend  helping out another friend.
632,Chandler,Stop it!
633,Chandler,We're doing this!
634,Chandler,Let's do it!
635,Monica,Noo!!
636,Monica,Okay!
637,Chandler,Okay!
638,Monica,"Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?"
639,Chandler,I have some moves.
640,Monica,I have no moves.
641,Monica,"Okay, whatcha doin' there?!"
642,Monica,Oh y'know what?
643,Monica,"I'm sorry, this is just too weird."
644,Chandler,"Yeah, let's just forget it."
645,Monica,What if I turn out the lights?
646,Chandler,Okay!
647,Chandler,Oh yeah.
648,Monica,Chandler?
649,Chandler,Yeah?
650,Monica,That's the couch.
651,Monica,Commercial Break
652,Chandler,Oh my God!
653,Monica,I know!
654,Monica,"I'll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!"
655,Chandler,"Oh, okay!"
656,Joey,Morning!
657,Rachel,Oh right.
658,Joey,Yeah.
659,Rachel,Oh God.
660,Rachel,Oh I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
661,Joey,Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
662,Rachel,Noo!
663,Rachel,"Oh God we didwe didn't, we didn't uhh"
664,Joey,No!
665,Joey,No!
666,Joey,"No, not after seeing that."
667,Rachel,God I'm just a horrible person.
668,Joey,Wh-why?
669,Rachel,Because I'm married.
670,Rachel,"That's right, I am a married woman!"
671,Rachel,And I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair!
672,Rachel,Uck!
673,Joey,That's ridiculous!
674,Joey,"I'm not a ""Star,"" just a regular famous actor."
675,Rachel,"Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person."
676,Joey,"Rachel, would you stop saying that?!"
677,Joey,"Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me"
678,Rachel,"The ring from the cave, yeah."
679,Joey,Wow!
680,Joey,"Uh okay, well uh"
681,Rachel,"Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?"
682,Joey,Sure!
683,Joey,As long as they don't find out you can keep whatever you want!
684,Joey,And I want you to have it.
685,Rachel,No!
686,Rachel,No-no-no
687,Joey,Yes!
688,Joey,Yes!!
689,Joey,"And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person."
690,Joey,"Okay, you've had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn't."
691,Joey,And that's what this ring stands for.
692,Rachel,But I thought that ring stood for Caprice's undying love for her brother.
693,Joey,"Look, do you want the ring or not?"
694,Rachel,Yeah!
695,Ross,Hey!
696,Joey,Hey!
697,Ross,Look at you!

701,Phoebe,Would you pour me some water?
702,Phoebe,I'll be back soon.
703,Joey,Whoa-whoa-whoa!
704,Joey,"You're not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?"

715,Joey,"Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol's great and I'm sure you're a very attractive man, but I."
716,Ross,No!

725,Joey,Just okayDid you do it right?
726,Ross,"Look, it's just did, did you ever go to a party and think, ""Would really anyone miss me if I weren't here?"""
727,Joey,Huh.
728,Joey,"But still Ross, you're worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day!"
729,Joey,Y'know what I mean?
730,Ross,"Oh-oh, absolutely!"
731,Ross,"It's just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around."
732,Joey,"But you got to be with both of them, right?"
733,Ross,Not-not really.
734,Ross,Th-th-there was just Carol.
735,Joey,Not the other one?
736,Ross,"No, she kept kicking me away!"
737,Joey,"Yeah, you don't want that."
738,Ross,No!
739,Joey,"Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?"
740,Ross,Oh I a lot of stuff!
741,Joey,You got a little bored?
742,Ross,A little.
743,Ross,Yeah.
744,Ross,I made a snack.
745,Joey,Yeah?
746,Joey,What did ya have?
747,Ross,Just a sandwich.
748,Ross,"Turkey, a little mustard"
749,Joey,Sounds good.

766,Chandler,Totally!
767,Chandler,"Totally, and you?"
768,Monica,Great!
769,Monica,It's so amazing!
770,Monica,"I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I'm all like, ""Can the doctor see me now?"""
771,Chandler,I bet he can.
772,Monica,"Y'know, I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical."
773,Monica,Are you sure you're okay?
774,Chandler,Oh yeah!
775,Chandler,Yeah!
776,Chandler,"Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!"
777,Rachel,Ohh!

797,Phoebe,"So this doesn't countAnyway, I'll be in my office."

806,Phoebe,Rubles!
807,Phoebe,You make one little mistake
808,Phoebe,"Oh, so this is all about money!"
809,Phoebe,Y'know it's bad enough thatOw!
810,Phoebe,"Oh, you have got to be kidding!"
811,Phoebe,I'm having another heart attack!
812,Phoebe,I'm having another heart attack!!
813,Phoebe,Call 9-1-1!
814,Phoebe,Dumbass!
815,Phoebe,"Well, they fired me and I'm having heart attack."
816,Phoebe,Yeah.
817,Rachel,Hi Ross!
818,Ross,Hey Rachel.
819,Rachel,Is Joey Tribbiani here?
820,Ross,"Umm, no."
821,Rachel,"Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I'm looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!"
822,Ross,That-that's always good news.
823,Ross,Are you okay?
824,Rachel,Me?
825,Rachel,I'm great!
826,Rachel,I'm fine!
827,Rachel,I'm sooo good!!
828,Rachel,"But, you know who's not great?!"
829,Rachel,Men!
830,Rachel,You're a man right Ross?
831,Ross,Yeah.
832,Rachel,Sit down!
833,Ross,Okay.
834,Rachel,"Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?!"
835,Rachel,"And why is it that the second we tell you we're going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor's dog walker?"
836,Ross,We're sorry.
837,Rachel,No seriously!
838,Rachel,Seriously!
839,Rachel,What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
840,Ross,Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?
841,Rachel,Aw what are you?!
842,Rachel,A detective?
843,Ross,"Look I-I don't know what's going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that."
844,Rachel,Oh.
845,Ross,Hey!
846,Ross,There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work!
847,Ross,Okay?
848,Ross,There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
849,Rachel,Who are these men?
850,Ross,Men.
851,Ross,I guy I know.
852,Rachel,"Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is  gay."
853,Ross,She is not  She's gay.
854,Ross,Oh my God.
855,Ross,She is so gay!
856,Ross,I can't believe this.
857,Rachel,Good day for married people huh?
858,Ross,I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
859,Rachel,I'm sorry your wife is gay.
860,Rachel,I guess women aren't that great either.
861,Ross,Try telling my wife that.
862,Chandler,Okay to come in?
863,Monica,"Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want."
864,Monica,Dr. Roger got beeped again.
865,Chandler,"Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?"
866,Monica,What?
867,Chandler,I'm the ruptured spleen.
868,Monica,Why would you do that?
869,Chandler,Because you shouldn't be with him.
870,Chandler,You should be with me.
871,Monica,Really?
872,Chandler,Yeah!
873,Chandler,"When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me!"
874,Chandler,"Look, things like last night they don't just happen."
875,Chandler,Y'know?
876,Chandler,Or at least not to me.
877,Chandler,"Or with the other two women, in the morning y'know I was just lying there and I couldn't wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y'know with a friend."
878,Monica,Chandler!
879,Chandler,"I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a ""doctor"""
880,Monica,"There was just one woman, wasn't there?"
881,Chandler,"No, there were two."
882,Monica,Including me?
883,Chandler,Oh yeah.
884,Chandler,Ending Credits
885,Phoebe,"It only takes two heart attacks to finally make you see     One of them won't do it, but the second one will set you free     Tell all your hate and anger, it's time to say good-bye     And that is just what I will do, soon as those bastards I work for die!"
886,Phoebe,"La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la   End"
0,Joey,Hey!
1,Joey,Hey!
2,Joey,Hey!
3,Joey,Hey!!
4,Joey,"None of that, not while you're living under my roof!"
5,Monica,What?
6,Joey,"Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it."
7,Chandler,Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
8,Joey,"Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman!"
9,Joey,And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition!
10,Joey,"Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about."
11,Joey,Chandler and
12,Monica,Okay.
13,Monica,Sorry.
14,Chandler,Sorry.
15,Joey,I can hear that!
16,Monica,Rachel's at work.
17,Joey,I can still hear you!
18,Joey,Opening Credits
19,Phoebe,Hey!
20,Joey,Hey!
21,Chandler,Hello!
22,Monica,"Hey, what's that?"
23,Phoebe,"Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother."
24,Phoebe,Can you believe it?!
25,Phoebe,"A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud."
26,Phoebe,Eeeee--ohh!!
27,Phoebe,God!
28,Joey,Argh-argh!!
29,Joey,"Ooh, soft."
30,Joey,Is this mink?
31,Phoebe,Yeah!
32,Phoebe,Why would my mother send me a fur?
33,Phoebe,Doesn't she know me but at all!
34,Phoebe,"Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!"
35,Chandler,"Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour."
36,Chandler,"That didn't happen, I made that up!"
37,Ross,Hey!
38,Ross,How come?
39,Ross,Everybody else does.
40,Monica,What is that?
41,Ross,"Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things."
42,Monica,This is all of your things.
43,Ross,"Yes, yes it is!"
44,Ross,"No, but it's good it'sEmily thinks we should get all new stuff."
45,Ross,"Stuff that's just ours, together."
46,Ross,Y'know brand new.
47,Monica,"So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale."
48,Ross,Touched.
49,Ross,Used.
50,Ross,Sat on.
51,Ross,Sleep on.
52,Joey,"Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?"
53,Ross,"Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine."
54,Chandler,"Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?"
55,Ross,After what I did?
56,Ross,Can you blame her?
57,Phoebe,Oh my God!
58,Phoebe,You got off easy!
59,Phoebe,"When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green."
60,Joey,What is he doing?
61,Joey,"What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?"
62,Monica,Now calm down Joey.
63,Joey,No!
64,Joey,"Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know?"
65,Joey,"Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!"
66,Phoebe,"Oh, I hate this."
67,Phoebe,Everything's changing.
68,Chandler,"Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence"
69,Monica,"Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves."
70,Monica,Are you cool with that?
71,Joey,No!
72,Joey,"But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool."
73,Rachel,"Ohh, whoa God!"
74,Rachel,Storage rooms give me the creeps!
75,Rachel,"Monica, come on please hurry up honey!"
76,Rachel,Please?
77,Monica,"Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron."
78,Rachel,I want the little round waffles.
79,Monica,All right.
80,Monica,"Op, here it is!"
81,Monica,Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb.
82,Monica,I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
83,Rachel,"Okay, y'know what?"
84,Rachel,I'll-I'll have toast!
85,Rachel,Arghhhh!!!!!
86,Monica,Oh my God!
87,Monica,Fog him!
88,Monica,Fog him!
89,Phoebe,I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
90,Joey,I'll take it!
91,Phoebe,That might work!
92,Joey,"Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah!"
93,Joey,Enh?
94,Joey,"All right, what do you think?"
95,Chandler,You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
96,Ross,"No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden."
97,Ross,"No, it's great."
98,Ross,Okay?
99,Ross,I'm totally on board.
100,Ross,"I love you too, all righty."
101,Ross,Bye.
102,Joey,What's the matter Ross?
103,Ross,Nothing.
104,Ross,"Oh, actually, great news!"
105,Ross,I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment.
106,Ross,Woo-hoo!
107,Phoebe,Why?
108,Ross,"Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment?"
109,Ross,"Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other."
110,Joey,That's way uptown!
111,Joey,That's like three trains away!
112,Joey,Which is great!
113,Joey,I love to ride that rail!
114,Chandler,So you're really okay with this?
115,Ross,Yes!
116,Ross,Yes!
117,Ross,"I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute."
118,Ross,I-I've been given the gift of time!
119,Chandler,"Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space."
120,Chandler,We should get them together and make a continuum.
121,Joey,Now he's movin'?
122,Joey,"Man, what is Emily doing to him?"
123,Joey,Ow!!
124,Joey,He's not even here!!
125,Rachel,You guys!
126,Rachel,You guys!
127,Monica,"We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!"
128,Rachel,"It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man!"
129,Rachel,"He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!"
130,Monica,"And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!"
131,Rachel,"Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!"
132,Joey,"Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?"
133,Rachel,Yeah!
134,Joey,"Yeah, you fogged Danny."
135,Rachel,Please!
136,Rachel,We did not fog Danny!
137,Rachel,Who's Danny?
138,Joey,Dan just moved in downstairs.
139,Joey,"Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes."
140,Joey,Nice fella.
141,Monica,Oh he's nice.
142,Monica,He's nice!
143,Monica,"Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!"
144,Rachel,Hi!
145,Rachel,"You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you."
146,Monica,We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
147,Rachel,Hi!
148,Rachel,"Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something."
149,Rachel,Hi!
150,Rachel,"Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it."
151,Monica,Yeah.
152,Monica,Wow!
153,Monica,That guy is so rude!
154,Rachel,Really!
155,Rachel,What is with that guy?
156,Rachel,I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
157,Monica,Well you did a little bit.
158,Rachel,"Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!"
159,Monica,I totally forgive you!
160,Rachel,Really?
161,Monica,Yes!
162,Phoebe,Hey!
163,Monica,Hey!
164,Phoebe,"So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?"
165,Monica,Crematorium Chris?
166,Monica,Sure!
167,Phoebe,"He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies."
168,Rachel,Oh my God!
169,Rachel,"Oh my God, look at these pelts!"
170,Monica,"Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated."
171,Rachel,What?
172,Rachel,"Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature!"
173,Rachel,"Not nature, fashion!"
174,Phoebe,This is fashion?!
175,Phoebe,"Okay, so to you, death is fashion?!"
176,Phoebe,That's really funny.
177,Phoebe,"Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia."
178,Phoebe,"I mean, you really thing this looks good?"
179,Phoebe,'Cause I do.
180,Ross,I know I miss you too.
181,Ross,I can't wait to see you.
182,Ross,I love you.
183,Ross,Bye.
184,Chandler,"Okay, what is in here?"
185,Chandler,Rocks?
186,Ross,"No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples."
187,Chandler,"So, rocks."
188,Ross,I'm really gonna miss this apartment.
189,Ross,"Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there."
190,Joey,Ohh.
191,Joey,"Hey, remember when I ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little?"
192,Ross,I loved this place!
193,Ross,"To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move."
194,Joey,"Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?"
195,Ross,"Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice"
196,Joey,You do have a choice!!
197,Joey,"Ross, why are you listening to her?!"
198,Joey,"Are you, are you crazy?"
199,Ross,Why?
200,Joey,It's not right what Emily wants you to do!
201,Joey,She is totally--Owww!!
202,Joey,Stop pinching me!
203,Joey,"Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right?"
204,Joey,Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
205,Ross,What's going on?
206,Joey,We all hate Emily!
207,Phoebe,Nooo!
208,Monica,"No, Ross, we do not hate Emily."
209,Monica,"We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy."
210,Joey,Yeah!
211,Chandler,"Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable."
212,Joey,Yes!
213,Joey,Yes!
214,Joey,Unreasonable!
215,Ross,Unreasonable?
216,Ross,How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married!
217,Ross,You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work!
218,Ross,"All right, it's about compromise!"
219,Ross,Do you always like it?
220,Ross,No!
221,Ross,Do you do it?
222,Ross,Yes!
223,Ross,"Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time!"
224,Ross,"It's real life, okay?"
225,Ross,It's what grown-ups do!
226,Phoebe,I think he's right.
227,Phoebe,You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
228,Phoebe,Commercial Break
229,Monica,"God, I feel so guilty about Ross."
230,Phoebe,"Oh, I know."
231,Joey,I kinda feel like it's my fault.
232,Chandler,Kind of?
233,Chandler,If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
234,Joey,"Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!"
235,Chandler,"Well, I think it's very brave what you said."
236,Phoebe,"All right, I can't sit here anymore."
237,Phoebe,I have to walk places.
238,Chandler,"Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat?"
239,Chandler,How about the whole animal rights thing?
240,Phoebe,"Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice."
241,Phoebe,"Okay, I admit it!"
242,Phoebe,I love this coat!
243,Phoebe,"Okay, Iit's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley!"
244,Phoebe,Remember Phil Huntley?
245,Phoebe,He was fine!
246,Rachel,Hi!
247,Rachel,What?
248,Rachel,YetiI mean Danny?
249,Rachel,Oh.
250,Rachel,"Listen, I'm so sorry."
251,Rachel,"I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so."
252,Rachel,Y'know.
253,Rachel,What?
254,Rachel,What?
255,Rachel,Hey!
256,Rachel,No-no-no!
257,Rachel,This not cool!
258,Rachel,You don't even know me!
259,Rachel,So from that you think you've got me all figured out?
260,Rachel,"Well, you don't!"
261,Rachel,Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!
262,Rachel,"Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants."
263,Rachel,And stop saying that!
264,Rachel,I hate that!
265,Rachel,Fine!
266,Rachel,I judged you.
267,Rachel,I made a snap judgement.
268,Rachel,But you did it too!
269,Rachel,And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement!
270,Rachel,You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong!
271,Rachel,What does that say about you?
272,Rachel,What?
273,Rachel,Okay.
274,Rachel,Okay.
275,Chandler,"Uh, Ross?"
276,Phoebe,Are you still mad at us?
277,Ross,Yep.
278,Phoebe,Oh good!
279,Phoebe,"Because we have an ""I'm sorry"" song."
280,Ross,Y'know what?
281,Ross,I'm really not in the mood.
282,Joey,"Look, Ross, I feel really bad."
283,Joey,"I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk."
284,Chandler,"Yeah, we are so sorry."
285,Phoebe,You're kinda stepping on the song.
286,Joey,"Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you."
287,Monica,"Whatever you decide, whatever you do."
288,Phoebe,"Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!"
289,Ross,"Look, this is hard enough!"
290,Ross,I really need you guys right now.
291,Phoebe,Yes!
292,Phoebe,Exactly!
293,Phoebe,And that's why
294,Monica,Why don't you come over tonight?
295,Monica,And I'll make you favorite dinner.
296,Ross,Okay.
297,Ross,Thanks you guys.
298,Ross,Pheebs are you wearing fur?
299,Phoebe,"Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!"
300,Joey,"Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today."
301,Ross,"You do, huh?"
302,Joey,"Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor."
303,Joey,Right?
304,Joey,So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know?
305,Joey,See what I'm saying?
306,Joey,I gotta lot of balls in the air.
307,Joey,Y'know what I mean?
308,Joey,It's tough!
309,Joey,"Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone"
310,Ross,What are you talking about?
311,Joey,I'm not sure.
312,Rachel,Hi!
313,Monica,"Hey, look at you!"
314,Monica,Where have you been?
315,Rachel,"Oh, I went to have pizza."
316,Rachel,With Danny.
317,Monica,How did that happen?
318,Rachel,That yeti is one smooth talker.
319,Monica,"I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready."
320,Rachel,"Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room."
321,Rachel,Come on you guys!
322,Rachel,"Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it."
323,Rachel,"It's okay, I really I don't mind."
324,Ross,Wait!
325,Ross,Wait!
326,Ross,Wait!
327,Ross,Y'know what?
328,Ross,Just stay.
329,Ross,Please?
330,Ross,It uh It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
331,Rachel,"Ross, I"
332,Joey,RACHEL PLEASE!!!
333,Joey,JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!
334,Rachel,Okay.
335,Rachel,Okay.
336,Rachel,"Joey, it's okay."
337,Rachel,Settle down.
338,Joey,"All right, I-I'm sorry."
339,Joey,I'm sorry.
340,Joey,You see Rach I'm an actor
341,Ross,Hey!
342,Ross,"Hey, look!"
343,Ross,Ugly Naked Guy's back!
344,Rachel,I haven't seen him in so long!
345,Phoebe,"Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!"
346,Monica,"Wow, this is so weird."
347,Monica,I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
348,Joey,It's almost as if he knew.
349,Monica,I'll get it.
350,Monica,Hello.
351,Monica,Hi Emily!
352,Monica,"Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down."
353,Monica,Hold on one second.
354,Ross,Hey!
355,Ross,"Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner."
356,Ross,"Uh, yeah, sure uh hold on."
357,Ross,She wants to say hi.
358,Ross,Hold on.
359,Phoebe,Hi Emily!
360,Chandler,Hi!
361,Joey,"Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!"
362,Ross,Y'know what?
363,Ross,"Uh, Rachel is here!"
364,Chandler,"Oh yeah, there-there she is!"
365,Ross,"Yeah, yeah, she's here."
366,Ross,Hi.
367,Ross,"Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?"
368,Ross,Emily that's ridiculous.
369,Ross,"Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you."
370,Ross,"Please, just get on the plane and come to New York."
371,Ross,"Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with."
372,Ross,"Well, you can't know where I am all the time."
373,Ross,"Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me."
374,Ross,"So, can you trust me?"
375,Joey,I think it's going okay.
376,Joey,Looks like he's smiling.
377,Monica,How can you tell?
378,Monica,You can only see the back of his head!
379,Joey,You can totally tell!
380,Joey,"Here look, watch me."

386,Ross,"Well, I guess that's it."
387,Joey,What happened?
388,Joey,What happened?
389,Ross,My marriage is over.
390,Monica,"Oh, sweetie."
391,Monica,"Oh, look at you."
392,Monica,You're shivering.
393,Phoebe,Here.
394,Rachel,"Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?"
395,Ross,Yeah.
396,Ross,You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
397,Ross,Ending Credits
398,Phoebe,"Okay, stop tormenting me!"
399,Phoebe,This mink!
400,Phoebe,"Okay, they're mean!"
401,Phoebe,And they hate squirrels!
402,Phoebe,"And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats!"
403,Phoebe,"All right, fine, now I get it."
404,Phoebe,Here.
405,Phoebe,You take it.
406,Phoebe,Are you happy now?
407,Phoebe,I'm cold!

0,Phoebe,"...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;and away they all flew like the down of a thistle; but I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, ""Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!"""
1,Joey,"Wow, that was great!"
2,Joey,You really wrote that?
3,Phoebe,Uh-huh.
4,Chandler,"Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa."
5,Monica,I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.
6,Ross,You're really not coming back?
7,Chandler,"Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year."
8,Chandler,"If I don't get it done, I'll be fired."
9,Monica,"It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!"
10,Chandler,"So, who does?"
11,Phoebe,"Oh, I like my job."
12,Joey,I *love* my job.
13,Rachel,"Yeah, I can't *wait* to go back to work."
14,Ross,I can't get *enough* dinosaurs!
15,Chandler,"I'm sorry, I won't be here."
16,Monica,It's just...
17,Monica,"It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand."
18,Chandler,Thanks.
19,Chandler,I'll see you New Year's Day.
20,Monica,You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve?
21,Chandler,Did I not mention that?
22,Monica,No!
23,Chandler,"(thinks for a second, then waves his arms,"
24,Chandler,"All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's *no* call  for writing ""Screw you, Mr."
25,Chandler,"Bing!"""
26,Chandler,on the back of my chair!
27,Chandler,"-- By the way, you can all call me Chandler."
28,Chandler,Hey.
29,Chandler,Where've you been?
30,Chandler,You hear that?
31,Chandler,"You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here."
32,Chandler,"Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up!"
33,Chandler,"I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order."
34,Chandler,"Well, that's like money in your pocket!"
35,Chandler,"- Alright look, you want me to say it?"
36,Chandler,This sucks.
37,Chandler,Being here sucks!
38,Chandler,This work sucks!
39,Chandler,I'm sorry.
40,Chandler,"Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight."
41,Chandler,I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread.
42,Chandler,"And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to."
43,Chandler,"Haha, no thanks!"
44,Chandler,"Oh, thanks!"
45,Chandler,I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.
46,Chandler,"Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know?"
47,Chandler,Our holidays are pretty traditional...
48,Phoebe,"So here is a, a very special holiday song that I wrote for some very important people to me."
49,Phoebe,"""Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap."
50,Phoebe,Asked him to bring my friends all kinds of crap.
51,Phoebe,Said all you need is to write them a song.
52,Phoebe,"Now, you haven't heard it yet, so don't try to sing along."
53,Phoebe,"No, don't sing along."
54,Phoebe,"Monica, Moncia, have a happy Hanukkah."
55,Phoebe,"Saw Santa Claus, he said hello to Ross."
56,Phoebe,"And please tell Joey, Christmas will be snowy!"
57,Phoebe,"And Rachel and Chandler, have err-umm-glander!!"""
58,Phoebe,"Happy holidays, everybody!"
59,Rachel,"Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet."
60,Chandler,"I can save you time ladies, I'm right here."
61,Phoebe,"Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk?"
62,Phoebe,This doesn't concern you.
63,Rachel,We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
64,Chandler,What?
65,Chandler,That's terrible!
66,Phoebe,"No-no, we do it every year!"
67,Chandler,"Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible."
68,Phoebe,"No, yeah, we never find them!"
69,Phoebe,"She's always best at us, that wily... minx."
70,Rachel,"Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?"
71,Chandler,"No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!"
72,Phoebe,"Oh no, we have to!"
73,Chandler,"No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too."
74,Phoebe,"Well then, you should look with us."
75,Chandler,Why?
76,Rachel,"Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?"
77,Chandler,"No, I have a great idea for a present for her."
78,Phoebe,"Oh, that's it?"
79,Phoebe,A great idea!
80,Phoebe,Oh yeah.
81,Rachel,"Chandler, that's not enough."
82,Rachel,"I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents?"
83,Rachel,And you've just gotten her one great present?
84,Rachel,I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad.
85,Rachel,Why would you do that to her Chandler?
86,Rachel,Why?
87,Rachel,Why?
88,Chandler,"If I help, we can find 'em faster!"
89,Rachel,That's right!
90,Phoebe,"Ooh ooh, we have a live one!"
91,Rachel,"Oh, it's a Macy's bag!"
92,Rachel,Oh.
93,Phoebe,"Ooh, who's it for?"
94,Rachel,"""Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch?"
95,Rachel,P.S.
96,Joey,"Rach, these are for you."
97,Rachel,Wiper blades.
98,Rachel,I don't even have a car.
99,Joey,"No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do."
100,Chandler,"OK, Pheebs, your turn."
101,Phoebe,"Ahh, toilet seat covers!"
102,Phoebe,Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
103,Joey,Uh-huh.
104,Phoebe,You guuuyys.
105,Joey,"And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth."
106,Ross,You got me a cola drink?
107,Chandler,"And, a lemon lime."
108,Ross,"Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater."
109,Chandler,And last but not least.
110,Joey,They're ribbed for *your* pleasure.
111,Ross,"Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?"
112,Ross,Yeah!
113,Monica,Come on Ben.
114,Ross,Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
115,Chandler,"Ho, ho, ho!"
116,Chandler,Merry Christmas!
117,Chandler,Hey!
118,Ross,"What are you doing here, Santa?"
119,Chandler,"Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben."
120,Chandler,"What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?"
121,Ross,"I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend."
122,Ross,You sent me here to give Ben some presents.
123,Ross,Remember?
124,Chandler,What?
125,Monica,"Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen?"
126,Monica,There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say.
127,Ross,What are you doing?
128,Chandler,"You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!"
129,Ross,"Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave."
130,Chandler,Why?
131,Ross,"Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it."
132,Chandler,But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
133,Ross,"I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me."
134,Chandler,"Fine, I'll give the suit back."
135,Monica,"Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?"
136,Chandler,Santa?
137,Chandler,Really?
138,Monica,"Yeah, is that okay?"
139,Chandler,Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
140,Monica,No.
141,Chandler,Then it's okaaay!
142,Chandler,"You know what, everybody?"
143,Chandler,Go home.
144,Chandler,You should be with your families.
145,Chandler,It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve.
146,Chandler,Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve?
147,Chandler,"-- Alright, look, go!"
148,Chandler,"Go home, okay?"
149,Chandler,Merry Christmas!
150,Chandler,Go.
151,Chandler,"Good, God's speed, good people!"
152,Chandler,You're not gonna go?
153,Chandler,Ah.

155,Chandler,Ah.
156,Chandler,Chandler Bing.
157,Chandler,change back an
158,Monica,Hi Honey!
159,Monica,We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.
160,Phoebe,Ble-blah-blar Blargh!
161,Chandler,"Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!"
162,Monica,So is it horrible?
163,Monica,Is everybody working really hard?
164,Chandler,"Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy."
165,Monica,Wendy?
166,Monica,-- That sounds like a girl's name.
167,Chandler,It is.
168,Chandler,Did I... not tell you about her?
169,Monica,"Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve."
170,Monica,Where is everybody else?
171,Chandler,I sent them home.
172,Monica,"Ohh, you are such a good boss!"
173,Monica,Is she pretty?
174,Chandler,"Uhh, uh..."
175,Ross,"Answer faster, answer faster!"
176,Chandler,I don't know!
177,Ross,"Answer better, answer better!"
178,Chandler,"I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague."
179,Monica,What does she do there?
180,Chandler,"Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me."
181,Monica,She did WHAT?
182,Chandler,BE-LOW me!
183,Joey,"Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?"
184,Monica,*What*?
185,Chandler,"Well, she... she didn't win..."
186,Monica,"Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work."
187,Chandler,"Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably..."
188,Rachel,"Oh Chandler, stop talking!"
189,Chandler,"Honey, there's really nothing to worry about."
190,Monica,Okay.
191,Chandler,I'm serious!
192,Monica,Okay!
193,Chandler,Merry Christmas.
194,Monica,Merry Christmas.
195,Chandler,"Merry Christmas, you guys!"
196,Phoebe,"Blah blargah, blar-blab."
197,Chandler,"The wife says ""Hi!"
198,Chandler,"""."
199,Chandler,"Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen."
200,Chandler,"This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie."
201,Chandler,"Whoa-ho, back off, Missy!"
202,Chandler,I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me!
203,Chandler,...
204,Chandler,Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?
205,Chandler,"No,... no...  NO!"
206,Chandler,"Look, I'm, I'm married!"
207,Chandler,I'm *happily* married.
208,Chandler,Right.
209,Chandler,"So, I'm sorry..."
210,Chandler,"Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know."
211,Chandler,"She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this"
212,Chandler,"I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!"
213,Monica,Really?
214,Chandler,You kidding?
215,Chandler,You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms...   Whoa!
216,Chandler,Whoa!
217,Chandler,Whoa!
218,Chandler,What's going on?
219,Chandler,You and I just made out!
220,Chandler,You and I are making out?
221,Monica,"Well, not anymore."
222,Chandler,But we don't do that.
223,Monica,"I know, I just thought it would be fun."
224,Chandler,How drunk are you?
225,Monica,Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this.
226,Monica,Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
227,Chandler,That's the perfect amount!
228,Monica,Okay!
229,Monica,Y'know what's weird?
230,Chandler,What?
231,Monica,This doesn't feel weird!
232,Chandler,I know.
233,Monica,You're a really good kisser.
234,Chandler,"Well, I have kissed over four women."
235,Chandler,Do you wanna get under the covers?
236,Monica,Hm-hmm!
237,Chandler,Okay!
238,Monica,Wow!
239,Monica,You are really fast!
240,Chandler,It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
241,Monica,We're gonna see each other naked.
242,Chandler,Yep!
243,Monica,Do you wanna do it at the same time?
244,Chandler,Count of three?
245,Monica,One!
246,Chandler,Two!
247,Monica,Two!
248,Chandler,Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
249,Monica,"Eh, we weren't that close anyway!"
250,Chandler,Eh!
251,Chandler,"So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?"
252,Monica,"Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him."
253,Chandler,"Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together."
254,Chandler,"But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary."
255,Chandler,I am *so* bad at this.
256,Monica,I think you're better than you think you are.
257,Chandler,Really?
258,Chandler,"Okay, so..."
259,Monica,Know when to stop.
260,Chandler,"Y'know, I sensed that I should stop."
261,Chandler,So we're okay?
262,Monica,Yeah.
263,Monica,"(They kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance."
264,Monica,Without turning
265,Chandler,Right!
266,Monica,"I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue."
267,Chandler,"Okay, all right, all right, all right!"
268,Chandler,Okay!
269,Chandler,"Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new."
270,Monica,You're so efficient.
271,Monica,I love you!
272,Chandler,Let's go!
273,Monica,"No-no-no, wait!"
274,Monica,We need something old!
275,Chandler,"Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve."
276,Monica,That'll work!
277,Chandler,I don't think so.
278,Monica,"Okay, now we just need something borrowed!"
279,Chandler,Here just...take this.
280,Monica,That's stealing!
281,Chandler,"No, we'll-we'll bring it back!"
282,Chandler,Just put it under your dress.
283,Monica,Ohh.
284,Chandler,"Okay, one thing at a time."
285,Monica,"Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding."
286,Monica,"I mean, you work, you work really hard for that."
287,Chandler,Ehh.
288,Monica,"Eh, you work for that."
289,Chandler,"Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry."
290,Chandler,I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
291,Monica,You do?
292,Chandler,"Yeah, I'm putting my foot down."
293,Chandler,"Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do."
294,Monica,"Oh, you're so sweet."
295,Monica,"Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?"
296,Chandler,"Eh, forget about the future and stuff!"
297,Chandler,"So we only have two kids, y'know?"
298,Chandler,We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
299,Monica,You thought about that?
300,Chandler,Yeah.
301,Monica,How many kids were we gonna have?
302,Chandler,"Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy."
303,Monica,What else did you think about?
304,Chandler,"Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know?"
305,Chandler,"Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff."
306,Chandler,"Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door."
307,Chandler,"Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old."
308,Monica,Y'know what?
309,Monica,"I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding."
310,Chandler,Sure you do.
311,Monica,"No, I want everything that you just said."
312,Monica,I want a marriage.
313,Chandler,You sure?
314,Monica,Uh-hmm.
315,Chandler,I love you so much.
316,Monica,I love you.
317,Rachel,"Oohh, I love it!"
318,Ross,Really?
319,Ross,You're not gonna return it?
320,Rachel,"Well, not this second!"
321,Phoebe,"Hey look, you guys, it's snowing!"
322,Rachel,"Oh wow, it's so beautiful..."
323,Ross,"Wow, it really is!"
324,Monica,"""Wendy"" is a fat girl name."
325,Phoebe,Aren't we done with that?
326,Monica,"Okay, fine."
327,Monica,Let's talk about snow.
328,Monica,"-- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?"
329,Chandler,Hey!
330,Ross,Oh my god...
331,Joey,"Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!"
332,Monica,What are you doing here?
333,Chandler,I wanted to be with you.
334,Chandler,I missed you so much.
335,Joey,"Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?"
336,Chandler,Monica.
337,Joey,Got ya.
338,Chandler,I never want to leave you again!
339,Monica,"But I thought if you left, you get fired."
340,Chandler,Turns out they can't fire me.
341,Chandler,Because I quit.
342,Monica,What?
343,Ross,"What, you, you really quit your job?"
344,Chandler,Yeah!
345,Chandler,"It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you."
346,Chandler,And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?
347,Rachel,What do you really want to do?
348,Chandler,I have *not* thought this through!
349,Monica,Oh my god!
350,Chandler,"I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it."
351,Monica,"No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!"
352,Chandler,Thanks!
353,Phoebe,"Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined."
354,Chandler,Ahh...
355,Phoebe,Now give me my real gift.
356,Phoebe,Thank you.
357,Chandler,"Here, pass these, will ya.."
358,Ross,"Oh, hey..."
359,Ross,"""A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet."""
360,Ross,-- How did you know?
361,Rachel,Wha... are you kidding?
362,Rachel,I can't return this.
363,Chandler,I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people.
364,Chandler,"Besides, this gift still says I love you guys."
365,Joey,Mine's is to Lilian Myers.
366,Chandler,I don't have a *job*!

1,Rachel,"For the last time, I don't care what the computer says, we did not take a bag of Mashuga nuts from the mini-bar and we did not watch Dr. Do-Me-A-Little!"
2,Joey,Hey!
3,Phoebe,Oh!
4,Phoebe,"Joey uh, were you in our room last night?"
5,Joey,No.
6,Joey,I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!
7,Chandler,Hi!
8,Chandler,We're checking out of the bridal suite.
9,Monica,That's right.
10,Monica,I'm no longer a bride.
11,Monica,I'll never be a bride again.
12,Monica,"Now, I'm just someone's wife!"
13,Chandler,And I'm the happiest guy in the world!
14,Chandler,"Oh honey, come on don't be upset."
15,Chandler,We still have so much to look forward to!
16,Monica,"Oh yeah, right."
17,Chandler,We got the honeymoon.
18,Monica,That's not til Thursday.
19,Chandler,The wedding pictures?
20,Monica,They won't be ready for weeks.
21,Chandler,Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
22,Monica,That's true!
23,Monica,I knew I married you for a reason!
24,Chandler,"I'll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home."
25,Monica,Okay.
26,Chandler,What?
27,Chandler,What did you take a picture of?
28,Joey,Nothing!
29,Joey,It was something.
30,Chandler,"Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?"
31,Rachel,Are you joking?
32,Rachel,Check out is not til noon and he has a good  eleven minutes left.
33,Chandler,Oh.
34,Monica,Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.
35,Rachel,"Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had."
36,Rachel,"Until y'know, he screamed out Radisson at the end."
37,Chandler,"Okay, well I'm gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed."
38,Chandler,32 Joe.
39,Chandler,You're 32!
40,Chandler,Front Desk

54,Chandler,Yeah but you don't needWhat is this?
55,Ross,Thread!
56,Chandler,Score!

58,Ross,What disposable cameras?
59,Chandler,The cameras?
60,Chandler,Remember last night I told you to take them?
61,Ross,No you didn't.
62,Chandler,Yes!
63,Chandler,Remember?
64,Chandler,"Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said"
65,Ross,"Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check."
66,Ross,"And then you said, ""Why do they call it a check?"
67,Ross,"Why not a Yugoslavian?"""
68,Ross,"Yeah, then you did that."
69,Chandler,So you don't have the cameras?
70,Ross,No.
71,Ross,Sorry man.
72,Chandler,So?
73,Chandler,What?
74,Chandler,What?
75,Chandler,They're gone!
76,Chandler,Monica's gonna freak!
77,Ross,"Well, I'm sure they're still somewhere here in the hotel."
78,Ross,I'll-I'll help you look for them.
79,Chandler,Great.
80,Ross,In-in three minutes.
81,Phoebe,Hey!
82,Monica,Hey!
83,Phoebe,Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?
84,Monica,No!
85,Monica,"But, they're callin' out to me!"
86,Monica,I mean this little guy  even crawled up into my lap.
87,Monica,"Oh come on, Chandler wouldn't mind if I opened just one present!"
88,Monica,What do you think it is?
89,Phoebe,A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.
90,Monica,A tiny salt shaker!!
91,Phoebe,Ohhh!
92,Phoebe,My God!
93,Phoebe,For tiny salt!
94,Monica,Oh wow!
95,Monica,Okay.
96,Monica,Well that was fun.
97,Phoebe,Oh yeah.
98,Monica,Good.
99,Monica,"Okay, I'm just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them."
100,Phoebe,Okay.
101,Monica,Whew.
102,Monica,"Although y'know, this is part of a salt and pepper set."
103,Monica,I mean I guess y'know it may just count as a half a present.
104,Monica,What do you think?
105,Phoebe,Well I guess it's okay to open one more if it's part of a set.
106,Phoebe,"Y'know, it's probably this one."
107,Monica,Or this one!
108,Rachel,Hi.
109,Monica,"Hey, how are you feelin'?"
110,Monica,Any morning sickness?
111,Rachel,Shh-shh-shh!
112,Rachel,The guys don't know yet do they?
113,Monica,No!
114,Monica,Joey and Ross don't know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebe's pregnant.
115,Phoebe,Yeah that's right Chandler does still think I'm pregnant.
116,Phoebe,He hasn't asked me how I'm feeling or offered to carry my bags.
117,Phoebe,"Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him."
118,Phoebe,After you of course.
119,Rachel,"Don't worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, cause I'm going to tell the father today."
120,Phoebe,"Ooh, is it someone in this building?"
121,Phoebe,Is it that tall guy from the first floor?
122,Rachel,Ew!
123,Rachel,No!
124,Phoebe,What?!
125,Phoebe,I think he's cute.
126,Rachel,Well then you have his baby.
127,Phoebe,Believe me I'm trying.
128,Monica,Wow.
129,Monica,Y'know it is so weird.
130,Monica,"I mean, you're gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea what's gonna happen."
131,Phoebe,Yeah.
132,Phoebe,You're just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever.
133,Phoebe,"You're like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism."
134,Rachel,Yeah.
135,Rachel,"Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news."
136,Phoebe,Pretty big?
137,Phoebe,It's huge!
138,Phoebe,"God, this guy doesn't have a clue!"
139,Phoebe,"He's just walking down the street thinking, I had sex with Rachel Green."
140,Phoebe,I rock!'
141,Phoebe,then bam!
142,Phoebe,He's a father and everything's different.
143,Rachel,Well it's only different if he wants it to be.
144,Rachel,"I mean, I'm not gonna ask him for anything."
145,Phoebe,Okay.
146,Phoebe,Then he still has this huge decision to make.
147,Phoebe,"Now he's walking around thinking, Do I want to be a dad?'"
148,Phoebe,and then bam!
149,Monica,What was that bam?
150,Phoebe,I don't.
151,Phoebe,He gothe-he-he-he's hit by a bus.
152,Joey,Hey!
153,Rachel,"Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?"
154,Joey,Who called here?
155,Joey,Did she sound blond?
156,Joey,Huh?
157,Joey,Did-did-did she have an accent?
158,Joey,I gotta make a call!
159,Joey,I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut!
160,Rachel,Oh Joey!
161,Rachel,Joey!
162,Rachel,"No, it's not you!"
163,Rachel,You didn't get anybody pregnant!
164,Joey,Oh.
165,Joey,Why would you scare me like that?
166,Joey,What the hell is going on?
167,Joey,Is somebody pregnant?
168,Phoebe,Oh yeah.
169,Phoebe,That's me.
170,Joey,Oh my God Pheebs!
171,Joey,You're gonna have a baby?
172,Phoebe,Yes.
173,Phoebe,Yes I am.
174,Phoebe,"Oh my God, I'm gonna have a baby!"
175,Joey,"Whoa, wait a minute."
176,Joey,Who's the father?
177,Phoebe,You don't know him.
178,Phoebe,It's not important.
179,Phoebe,He wants nothing to do with me or the baby.
180,Joey,Well who is this guy?!
181,Joey,Huh?
182,Joey,Who is he?
183,Joey,Cause I will track him down and kick his ass!
184,Phoebe,David Lynn.
185,Joey,David Lynn!
186,Joey,David Lynn!
187,Joey,David Lynn!
188,Monica,Who's David Lynn?
189,Phoebe,Oh some guy from my gym.
190,Phoebe,A little annoying.
191,Ross,Chandler?
192,Chandler,Hey!
193,Chandler,Did you find the cameras?
194,Ross,No.
195,Ross,Did you?
196,Chandler,Yes!
197,Chandler,And that's why I'm under the table.
198,Chandler,Celebrating.
199,Ross,"Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-one's turned them."
200,Chandler,Well this is great.
201,Chandler,"Y'know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she's really depressed."
202,Ross,"Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?"
203,Chandler,All my energy is going into not asking that question.
204,Chandler,I can't believe I screwed this up!
205,Ross,I'm sorry man.
206,Ross,Here's a thought.
207,Ross,This is the same ballroom.
208,Ross,There's a band.
209,Ross,There's gonna be plenty of dressed up people.
210,Chandler,Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
211,Ross,"No-no-no, I'm saying we-we buy more of this  at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures."
212,Ross,All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else's faces.
213,Chandler,Are you serious?
214,Ross,I'm just thinking about your new bride at home.
215,Ross,Okay?
216,Ross,Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?
217,Chandler,Marriage advice?
218,Chandler,Really?
219,Ross,"I'm telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding!"
220,Ross,Aren't these the same flowers?
221,Chandler,"I don't know, Monica picked out the flowers."
222,Ross,What about the chairs?
223,Chandler,She picked those out too.
224,Ross,How about the place settings?
225,Chandler,That was her.
226,Ross,What did you do?
227,Chandler,I was in charge of the cameras!
228,Chandler,Gift shop?
229,Ross,Hmm.
230,Phoebe,Hey!
231,Phoebe,"Ooh, did you do it yet?"
232,Rachel,Not yet.
233,Phoebe,"Oh, well what are you doing here?"
234,Phoebe,Are you about to do it?
235,Phoebe,Is it Gunther?
236,Rachel,No!
237,Rachel,"Phoebe, it's not Gunther."
238,Phoebe,"Thank God, cause that hair on a baby"
239,Rachel,Phoebe the father is not here okay?
240,Rachel,I haven't told him yet and I don't think I can tell him at all now!
241,Phoebe,Why not?
242,Rachel,"I don't know, let me think."
243,Rachel,"I was walking down the street thinking, I'm gonna tell the father today' and then bam!"
244,Phoebe,Bus?
245,Rachel,"No, you!"
246,Rachel,Phoebe you freaked me out.
247,Rachel,You kept saying how huge this all is!
248,Phoebe,Well-well but it is huge.
249,Rachel,"I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me."
250,Rachel,I didn't even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.
251,Phoebe,You're thinking about this way too much.
252,Phoebe,Just tell him and get it over with.
253,Phoebe,"It's like, it's like ripping off this Band-Aid."
254,Phoebe,"Quick and painless, watch."
255,Phoebe,Oh mother ofSee?
256,Joey,Ooh-ooh-ooh!
257,Joey,Are we opening presents?
258,Monica,No!
259,Monica,No!
260,Monica,I shouldn't have even opened these!
261,Monica,I mean IJoey I am out of control!!
262,Monica,"Joey, you have to do me a favor."
263,Monica,"No matter what I say, no matter what I do, please do not let me open another present!"
264,Monica,Okay?
265,Joey,Okay.
266,Monica,Give me one more.
267,Joey,Okay.
268,Phoebe,Hey.
269,Joey,"Oh good, uh you're here."
270,Joey,Uh Pheebs?
271,Joey,Listen uh sit down.
272,Joey,I-I got something I want to say.
273,Phoebe,All right.
274,Joey,"Umm, now uh It's a scary world out there, especially for a single mom."
275,Joey,"Y'know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so  Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?"
276,Monica,Oh my God!
277,Monica,Joey!
278,Phoebe,Hell yeah!
279,Phoebe,I'll marry you!
280,Monica,You can't marry him!
281,Phoebe,"Hey lady, your day's over!"
282,Phoebe,It's my turn!
283,Monica,Phoebe!
284,Joey,Why?!
285,Joey,Why can't she marry me?
286,Phoebe,I can and I will!
287,Monica,She's not pregnant.
288,Monica,It's Rachel.
289,Monica,Rachel's the one who's pregnant.
290,Joey,Oh my God.
291,Phoebe,Hey!
292,Monica,Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn't have a baby in nine months!
293,Phoebe,It's Joey!
294,Joey,Now I can't believe it!
295,Joey,What?
296,Joey,Rachel's pregnant?
297,Joey,Who's the father?
298,Phoebe,We don't know.
299,Joey,Ohh I wonder if that dude.
300,Monica,There's a dude?
301,Joey,Yeah.
302,Phoebe,Who?
303,Phoebe,Who is it?
304,Joey,"About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn't see who it was but"
305,Phoebe,Was that story over?
306,Joey,The guy left this.
307,Phoebe,Oh my God!
308,Phoebe,I know who the father is
309,Monica,People have got to finish their stories!
310,Monica,Commercial Break
311,Chandler,"Uh, excuse me?"
312,Chandler,Could you take a picture of us?
313,Chandler,Woman At The

322,Chandler,Man At The
323,Chandler,Who are you?
324,Chandler,Ansel Adams?!
325,Chandler,Get outta here!
326,Phoebe,"Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him."
327,Phoebe,Go!
328,Rachel,What?
329,Rachel,Hey wait a minute!
330,Rachel,"Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?"
331,Phoebe,"I may play the fool at times, but I'm a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won't quit."
332,Phoebe,I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.
333,Rachel,"Oh God Oh, he's in there right now?"
334,Phoebe,Uh-huh.
335,Phoebe,Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off.
336,Phoebe,What to you want to do?
337,Rachel,"Uh, let's rip!"
338,Phoebe,Really?
339,Phoebe,Are you sure?
340,Rachel,Oh Phoebe!
341,Phoebe,"Okay, sorry."
342,Phoebe,Yeah.
343,Chandler,Why don't you go up on stage.
344,Chandler,I'll get a picture of you doing the speech.
345,Ross,Okay.
346,Ross,Okay!
347,Ross,Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre please see the front desk?
348,Ross,Your car is about to be towed.

355,Ross,Anxious Wedding
356,Ross,Well go!
357,Ross,Go move it!
358,Chandler,"Okay, you ready for the last picture?"
359,Ross,Yeah.
360,Chandler,Get ready to run.
361,Chandler,Congratulations on your wedding.
362,Phoebe,"Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater."
363,Phoebe,Oh no.
364,Phoebe,Could I get anyone a coffee orpoison?
365,Phoebe,No?
366,Phoebe,Just for me?
367,Phoebe,Okay.
368,Rachel,Nothing!
369,Rachel,Phoebe kinda made a mistake.
370,Rachel,"But y'know you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?"
371,Rachel,"Oh, it's just not the right time."
372,Rachel,Okay.
373,Rachel,Tag
374,Rachel,I'm having a baby.
375,Rachel,You can go.
376,Monica,I don't know how any of these got opened?
377,Joey,You opened them all?
378,Monica,I know!
379,Monica,I know!
380,Monica,I am a terrible person!
381,Monica,"I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!"
382,Joey,Oh hey!
383,Joey,You got my parent's gift!
384,Monica,Yeah.
385,Monica,What is that?
386,Joey,"Well, I don't know."
387,Joey,I think it does something to salami.
388,Monica,Hey!
389,Monica,How'd it go?
390,Joey,Yeah.
391,Joey,What-what did Tag say?
392,Rachel,Tag is not the father!
393,Rachel,And Joey knows now?
394,Joey,I do Rach.
395,Joey,"I do, and I so happy for you."
396,Rachel,"Oh wow, you didn't even try to unhook my bra!"
397,Monica,So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
398,Rachel,"No, I will."
399,Rachel,I'm just not up for it tonight.
400,Joey,"Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know you're not gonna be alone in this."
401,Rachel,I'm not?
402,Joey,Listen I uh  It's a scary world out there especially if you're a single mom.
403,Joey,"Y'know, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond."
404,Joey,Y'know?
405,Joey,"So,  Rachel Green will you marry me?"
406,Rachel,What?
407,Monica,What?
408,Phoebe,What?!
409,Joey,"Pheebs, give me the ring back!"
410,Phoebe,No!
411,Rachel,No!
412,Rachel,"Joey, oh you're so sweet."
413,Rachel,"You're so-so sweet, honey."
414,Rachel,"But I'm not, I'm not looking for a husband."
415,Joey,I understand.
416,Rachel,"Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down."
417,Phoebe,I can't say that didn't hurt.
418,Phoebe,But I'll take you back Joey Tribbiani.
419,Joey,Uh yeah.
420,Joey,"Pheebs, listen about that."
421,Joey,I only offered
422,Phoebe,Ooh!
423,Phoebe,A Salami Buddy!
424,Joey,There you go!
425,Chandler,We're back!
426,Monica,Great!
427,Monica,We're hangin' in the kitchen!
428,Monica,Let's stay in the kitchen!
429,Chandler,It's picture time.
430,Ross,Now you are going to love these.
431,Chandler,Here's a picture of Ross.
432,Chandler,And that's me.
433,Chandler,And that's me and Ross.
434,Chandler,"Oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple."
435,Monica,Wow!
436,Monica,That is a great picture!
437,Chandler,Eh?
438,Monica,Yeah!
439,Monica,Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags!
440,Ross,"Huh, didn't see that coming."
441,Chandler,"Okay, so this isn't a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss withwith this lady."
442,Chandler,Which by the look on your face I'm sure you'll remember.
443,Chandler,So we don't needThere's no need to have this picture.
444,Chandler,How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.
445,Monica,That would be a good idea.
446,Chandler,Okay.
447,Chandler,You opened all the presents without me?!
448,Chandler,I thought we were supposed to do that together!
449,Monica,You kissed another woman!
450,Chandler,Call it even?
451,Monica,Okay!
452,Ross,"Well, I'm gonna go get these  in some water."
453,Phoebe,Wait you stole those from these people's wedding?
454,Ross,"No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby."
455,Ross,"Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming."
456,Ross,Hey!
457,Ross,My sweater!
458,Ross,I've been looking for this for like a month!
459,Ross,Monica and
460,Phoebe,Oh my God!
461,Joey,Oh my God!
462,Joey,Closing Credits
463,Ross,Hey!
464,Ross,How you doing?
465,Ross,Yeah.
466,Ross,"Oh hey, right back at ya."
467,Ross,Yeah.
468,Ross,"SheWell, she's one crazy lady?"
469,Ross,"Umm, I don't some Italian guy."
470,Ross,"Come on, read your own label."
471,Ross,See you later.
472,Ross,He is so weird.
473,Ross,End
0,Monica,There's nothing to tell!
1,Monica,He's just some guy I work with!
2,Joey,"C'mon, you're going out with the guy!"
3,Joey,There's gotta be something wrong with him!
4,Chandler,"All right Joey, be nice."
5,Chandler,So does he have a hump?
6,Chandler,A hump and a hairpiece?
7,Phoebe,"Wait, does he eat chalk?"
8,Phoebe,"Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!"
9,Monica,"Okay, everybody relax."
10,Monica,This is not even a date.
11,Monica,It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
12,Chandler,Sounds like a date to me.
13,Chandler,"Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked."
14,Chandler,"Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there."
15,Joey,Instead of...?
16,Chandler,That's right.
17,Joey,Never had that dream.
18,Phoebe,No.
19,Chandler,"All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring."
20,Chandler,"Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me."
21,Monica,And they weren't looking at you before?
22,Chandler,"Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!"
23,Ross,Hi.
24,Joey,"This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself."
25,Monica,"Are you okay, sweetie?"
26,Ross,"I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck..."
27,Chandler,Cookie?
28,Monica,Carol moved her stuff out today.
29,Joey,Ohh.
30,Monica,Let me get you some coffee.
31,Ross,Thanks.
32,Phoebe,Ooh!
33,Phoebe,Oh!
34,Ross,"No, no don't!"
35,Ross,Stop cleansing my aura!
36,Ross,"No, just leave my aura alone, okay?"
37,Phoebe,Fine!
38,Phoebe,Be murky!
39,Ross,"I'll be fine, alright?"
40,Ross,"Really, everyone."
41,Ross,I hope she'll be very happy.
42,Monica,No you don't.
43,Ross,"No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!"
44,Joey,And you never knew she was a lesbian...
45,Ross,No!!
46,Ross,Okay?!
47,Ross,Why does everyone keep fixating on that?
48,Ross,"She didn't know, how should I know?"
49,Chandler,Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?
50,Ross,"I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well."
51,Monica,"Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing"
52,Ross,Sorry.
53,Joey,"Alright Ross, look."
54,Joey,You're feeling a lot of pain right now.
55,Joey,You're angry.
56,Joey,You're hurting.
57,Joey,Can I tell you what the answer is?
58,Joey,Strip joint!
59,Joey,"C'mon, you're single!"
60,Joey,Have some hormones!
61,Ross,"I don't want to be single, okay?"
62,Ross,I just...
63,Ross,I just- I just wanna be married again!
64,Chandler,And I just want a million dollars!
65,Monica,Rachel?
66,Rachel,Oh God Monica hi!
67,Rachel,Thank God!
68,Rachel,"I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!"
69,Monica,De-caff.
70,Monica,"Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor."
71,Monica,"This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?"
72,Rachel,"Hi, sure!"
73,Ross,Hi.
74,Monica,"So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?"
75,Rachel,"Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding."
76,Rachel,"I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat."
77,Rachel,This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat.
78,Rachel,When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry!
79,Rachel,"And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit"
80,Monica,Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
81,Rachel,"Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue..."
82,Monica,"Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it."
83,Chandler,Tuna or egg salad?
84,Chandler,Decide!
85,Ross,I'll have whatever Christine is having.
86,Rachel,"Daddy, I just..."
87,Rachel,I can't marry him!
88,Rachel,I'm sorry.
89,Rachel,I just don't love him.
90,Rachel,"Well, it matters to me!"
91,Phoebe,"If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off."
92,Chandler,"Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants."
93,Joey,I say push her down the stairs.
94,Joey,"Phoebe, Ross, Chandler, and"
95,Joey,Push her down the stairs!
96,Joey,Push her down the stairs!
97,Joey,Push her down the stairs!
98,Rachel,"C'mon Daddy, listen to me!"
99,Rachel,"It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe!"
100,Rachel,"You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'."
101,Rachel,"And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe?"
102,Rachel,"What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know?"
103,Rachel,Or a- or a hat!
104,Rachel,"No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!"
105,Ross,You can see where he'd have trouble.
106,Rachel,"Look Daddy, it's my life."
107,Rachel,Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
108,Monica,"Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica..."
109,Rachel,"Well, maybe that's my decision."
110,Rachel,"Well, maybe I don't need your money."
111,Rachel,Wait!!
112,Rachel,"Wait, I said maybe!"
113,Monica,"Just breathe, breathe.. that's it."
114,Monica,Just try to think of nice calm things...
115,Phoebe,"Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens,  bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string."
116,Phoebe,These are a few...
117,Rachel,I'm all better now.
118,Phoebe,I helped!
119,Monica,"Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know?"
120,Monica,Independence.
121,Monica,Taking control of your life.
122,Monica,"The whole, 'hat' thing."
123,Joey,"And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey."
124,Joey,Me and Chandler live across the hall.
125,Joey,And he's away a lot.
126,Monica,"Joey, stop hitting on her!"
127,Monica,It's her wedding day!
128,Joey,"What, like there's a rule or something?"
129,Chandler,"Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound."
130,Monica,"Oh God, is it"
131,Joey,Who's Paul?
132,Ross,"Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?"
133,Monica,Maybe.
134,Joey,Wait.
135,Joey,Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
136,Ross,He finally asked you out?
137,Monica,Yes!
138,Chandler,"Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment."
139,Monica,"Rach, wait, I can cancel..."
140,Rachel,"Please, no, go, that'd be fine!"
141,Monica,"Are, are you okay?"
142,Monica,"I mean, do you want me to stay?"
143,Ross,That'd be good...
144,Monica,Really?
145,Ross,"No, go on!"
146,Ross,It's Paul the Wine Guy!
147,Phoebe,What does that mean?
148,Phoebe,"Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?"
149,Monica,"Hi, come in!"
150,Monica,"Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul."
151,Chandler,"I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name."
152,Chandler,"Paul, was it?"
153,Monica,"Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah..."
154,Ross,A wandering?
155,Monica,Change!
156,Monica,"Okay, sit down."
157,Monica,Two seconds.
158,Phoebe,"Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes."
159,Phoebe,That can't be good.
160,Joey,"Hey, Paul!"
161,Joey,"Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red."
162,Monica,"Shut up, Joey!"
163,Ross,"So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?"
164,Rachel,"Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!"
165,Ross,"Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your-  -big lizards..."
166,Ross,"Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture."
167,Chandler,"Yes, and we're very excited about it."
168,Rachel,"Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight."
169,Rachel,It's been kinda a long day.
170,Ross,"Okay, sure."
171,Joey,"Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?"
172,Phoebe,"Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to."
173,Phoebe,Commercial Break
174,Phoebe,"Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart."
175,Phoebe,La-la-la-la-la-  Thank you.
176,Phoebe,La-la-la-la...ohhh!
177,Ross,"I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys."
178,Ross,"I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs."
179,Joey,I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
180,Chandler,It's a beautiful thing.
181,Joey,What's this?
182,Chandler,I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
183,Joey,Which goes where?
184,Chandler,I have no idea.
185,Joey,Done with the bookcase!
186,Chandler,All finished!
187,Ross,This was Carol's favorite beer.
188,Ross,"She always drank it out of the can, I should have known."
189,Joey,"Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here."
190,Chandler,"Yes, please don't spoil all this fun."
191,Joey,"Ross, let me ask you a question."
192,Joey,"She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?"
193,Ross,You guys.
194,Chandler,"Oh, God."
195,Joey,You got screwed.
196,Chandler,Oh my God!
197,Monica,Oh my God!
198,Monica,"My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess."
199,Monica,How did you get through it?
200,Monica,-leg?
201,Monica,You actually broke her watch?
202,Monica,Wow!
203,Monica,"The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel."
204,Monica,That's right.
205,Rachel,"Barry, I'm sorry..."
206,Rachel,I am so sorry...
207,Rachel,"I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju-  Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me."
208,Rachel,"And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too..."
209,Ross,I'm divorced!
210,Ross,I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
211,Joey,Shut up!
212,Chandler,You must stop!
213,Ross,That only took me an hour.
214,Chandler,"Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento."
215,Chandler,"You, however have had the love of a woman for four years."
216,Chandler,"Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!"
217,Chandler,I don't think that was my point!
218,Ross,You know what the scariest part is?
219,Ross,"What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know?"
220,Ross,I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it?
221,Ross,"Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her..."
222,Joey,What are you talking about?
223,Joey,'One woman'?
224,Joey,That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you.
225,Joey,"Lemme tell you something, Ross."
226,Joey,There's lots of flavors out there.
227,Joey,"There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing!"
228,Joey,Cherry Vanilla.
229,Joey,"You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream!"
230,Joey,This is the best thing that ever happened to you!
231,Joey,"You got married, you were, like, what, eight?"
232,Joey,Welcome back to the world!
233,Joey,Grab a spoon!
234,Ross,I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
235,Chandler,Stay out of my freezer!
236,Monica,What?.....
237,Monica,"What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?"
238,Monica,"Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?"
239,Monica,"Yeah... yeah, I think there is."
240,Monica,-What were you gonna say?
241,Monica,"Oh God, oh God, I am sorry..."
242,Monica,I am so sorry...
243,Monica,I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now.
244,Monica,Um... how long?
245,Monica,Wow!
246,Monica,I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
247,Monica,...Yeah.
248,Monica,"Yeah, I do."
249,Rachel,Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi!
250,Rachel,That's the difference!
251,Ross,Grab a spoon.
252,Ross,Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon?
253,Ross,"Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?"
254,Joey,Great story!
255,Joey,"But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man,"
256,Chandler,"Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats."
257,Joey,Right.
258,Joey,Thanks.
259,Joey,It's June.
260,Joey,I'm outta here.
261,Ross,"Y'know, here's the thing."
262,Ross,"Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?"
263,Ross,Commercial Break
264,Rachel,Isn't this amazing?
265,Rachel,"I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life."
266,Chandler,That is amazing.
267,Joey,Congratulations.
268,Rachel,"Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do."
269,Chandler,"If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do."
270,Joey,"Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something..."
271,Joey,Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
272,Monica,"Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here."
273,Joey,"Morning, Paul."
274,Rachel,"Hello, Paul."
275,Chandler,"Hi, Paul, is it?"
276,Monica,Stop!
277,Monica,We'll talk later.
278,Joey,That wasn't a real date?!
279,Joey,What the hell do you do on a real date?
280,Monica,"Shut up, and put my table back."
281,Chandler,"All right, kids, I gotta get to work."
282,Chandler,"If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference..."
283,Rachel,"So, like, you guys all have jobs?"
284,Monica,"Yeah, we all have jobs."
285,Monica,"See, that's how we buy stuff."
286,Joey,"Yeah, I'm an actor."
287,Rachel,Wow!
288,Rachel,Would I have seen you in anything?
289,Joey,I doubt it.
290,Joey,Mostly regional work.
291,Monica,"Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park."
292,Joey,"Look, it was a job all right?"
293,Chandler,"'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'"
294,Joey,I will not take this abuse.
295,Chandler,"You're right, I'm sorry."
296,Chandler,"""Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."""
297,Joey,"You should both know, that he's a dead man."
298,Joey,"Oh, Chandler?"
299,Monica,So how you doing today?
300,Monica,Did you sleep okay?
301,Monica,Talk to Barry?
302,Monica,I can't stop smiling.
303,Rachel,I can see that.
304,Rachel,You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
305,Monica,"I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?"
306,Rachel,"Oh, yeah."
307,Monica,"Well, it's like that."
308,Monica,With feelings.
309,Rachel,Oh wow.
310,Rachel,Are you in trouble.
311,Monica,Big time!
312,Rachel,Want a wedding dress?
313,Rachel,Hardly used.
314,Monica,I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here.
315,Monica,Okay.
316,Monica,Okay.
317,Monica,"I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day."
318,Monica,Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
319,Rachel,"Oh, look, wish me luck!"
320,Monica,What for?
321,Rachel,I'm gonna go get one of those  job things.
322,Monica,"Hey Frannie, welcome back!"
323,Monica,How was Florida?
324,Monica,How do you do that?
325,Monica,You know Paul?
326,Monica,You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
327,Joey,Of course it was a line!
328,Monica,Why?!
329,Monica,Why?
330,Monica,"Why, why would anybody do something like that?"
331,Ross,I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
332,Monica,I hate men!
333,Monica,I hate men!
334,Phoebe,"Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe."
335,Monica,Is it me?
336,Monica,Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
337,Phoebe,"All right, c'mere, gimme your feet."
338,Monica,"I just thought he was nice, y'know?"
339,Joey,I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
340,Rachel,Guess what?
341,Ross,You got a job?
342,Rachel,Are you kidding?
343,Rachel,I'm trained for nothing!
344,Rachel,I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
345,Chandler,And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
346,Rachel,"You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!"
347,Chandler,"Oh, how well you know me..."
348,Rachel,"They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!"
349,Monica,How'd you pay for them?
350,Rachel,"Uh, credit card."
351,Monica,And who pays for that?
352,Rachel,Um... my... father.
353,Rachel,"Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary?"
354,Rachel,"I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want."
355,Monica,"C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life."
356,Rachel,I know that.
357,Rachel,That's why I was getting married.
358,Phoebe,"Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time."
359,Rachel,Thank you.
360,Phoebe,You're welcome.
361,Phoebe,I remember when I first came to this city.
362,Phoebe,I was fourteen.
363,Phoebe,"My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody."
364,Phoebe,"And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy."
365,Phoebe,"So believe me, I know exactly how you feel."
366,Ross,The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
367,Monica,"All right, you ready?"
368,Rachel,No.
369,Rachel,"No, no, I'm not ready!"
370,Rachel,How can I be ready?
371,Rachel,"""Hey, Rach!"
372,Rachel,"You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?"""
373,Rachel,"Come on, I can't do this!"
374,Monica,"You can, I know you can!"
375,Rachel,I don't think so.
376,Ross,"Come on, you made coffee!"
377,Ross,You can do anything!
378,Ross,"C'mon, cut."
379,Ross,"Cut, cut, cut,..."
380,Rachel,Y'know what?
381,Rachel,I think we can just leave it at that.
382,Rachel,It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
383,Monica,Rachel!
384,Monica,That was a library card!
385,Chandler,"Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream."
386,Monica,Welcome to the real world!
387,Monica,It sucks.
388,Monica,You're gonna love it!
389,Monica,"Well, that's it  You gonna crash on the couch?"
390,Ross,No.
391,Ross,"No, I gotta go home sometime."
392,Monica,You be okay?
393,Ross,Yeah.
394,Rachel,"Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor."
395,Rachel,What?
396,Monica,That's Paul's watch.
397,Monica,You just put it back where you found it.
398,Monica,Oh boy.
399,Monica,Alright.
400,Monica,"Goodnight, everybody."
401,Monica,Ross and
402,Rachel,Goodnight.
403,Ross,Mmm.
404,Ross,"Oh, no-"
405,Rachel,Sorry-
406,Ross,"No no no, go-"
407,Rachel,"No, you have it, really, I don't want it-"
408,Ross,Split it?
409,Rachel,Okay.
410,Ross,Okay.
411,Ross,"You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you."
412,Rachel,I knew.
413,Ross,You did!
414,Ross,Oh....
415,Ross,I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
416,Rachel,I did.
417,Ross,Oh.
418,Ross,"Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?"
419,Ross,Sometime?
420,Ross,Maybe?
421,Rachel,"Yeah, maybe..."
422,Ross,"Okay... okay, maybe I will..."
423,Rachel,Goodnight.
424,Ross,Goodnight.
425,Monica,"See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?"
426,Ross,I just grabbed a spoon.
427,Ross,Closing Credits
428,Joey,I can't believe what I'm hearing here.

432,Phoebe,What I said you had...
433,Monica,Would you stop?
434,Phoebe,"Oh, was I doing it again?"
435,Monica,"I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt."
436,Joey,"Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya."
437,Ross,There's an image.
438,Rachel,Would anybody like more coffee?
439,Chandler,"Did you make it, or are you just serving it?"
440,Rachel,I'm just serving it.
441,Chandler,"Kids, new dream..."
442,Chandler,I'm in Las Vegas.
443,Rachel,Ugh.
444,Rachel,"Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there?"
445,Rachel,Go ahead.
446,Rachel,Thank you.

14,Joey,"Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year?"
15,Joey,"When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, ""Joey, what are you doing with your life?"""
16,Joey,stuff.
17,Joey,"I can say, ""Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad."
18,Joey,"What are you doing with your life?"""
19,Chandler,You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here.
20,Chandler,Kathy didn't cheat on all of you.
21,Chandler,"Well, except you."
22,Monica,"Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone."
23,Monica,I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy.
24,Monica,Maybe you can go fishing next week?
25,Joey,"Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One."
26,Joey,Y'know?
27,Joey,"I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two."
28,Monica,What's Phase Two?
29,Joey,Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club.
30,Rachel,How does going to a strip club help him better?
31,Ross,Because there are naked ladies there.
32,Joey,"Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women."
33,Ross,There are naked ladies there too.
34,Joey,Yeah.

89,Joey,"Oh my God, you guys have no idea."
90,Monica,You stink!
91,Ross,Are you kidding?
92,Joey,"Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower."
93,Joey,Plus!
94,Joey,I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand!
95,Joey,"Hey, how-how's he doing?"
96,Ross,He hasn't gotten out of that chair in two days.
97,Joey,Hey buddy!
98,Joey,How's it going?
99,Joey,"Hey, see that?"
100,Joey,He just needed his pal to come home.

106,Rachel,"Hey, Monica!"
107,Monica,"Uh-oh, what's the matter?"
108,Rachel,"Ohh, it's Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight."
109,Rachel,"But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera."
110,Rachel,So What are you gonna do?
111,Monica,I don't know sweetie.
112,Rachel,No!
113,Rachel,Help me!
114,Monica,I can't!
115,Monica,I have to work!
116,Rachel,Phoebe?
117,Phoebe,"I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening."
118,Rachel,Ugh!
119,Phoebe,Unless!
120,Phoebe,She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
121,Rachel,"Ohh, gosh."
122,Rachel,"You guys, come on, this isI have to meet Joshua!"
123,Rachel,This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel.
124,Rachel,"Y'know the ""Wouldn't it be great if she was my wife"" Rachel."
125,Rachel,"Ohh, all right!"
126,Rachel,Are Joey and Chandler back?
127,Monica,"No, Chandler's still in Phase One, and Joey's that thing you smell."
128,Rachel,Ohh!
129,Rachel,Hi!
130,Ross,Hi!
131,Rachel,So.
132,Ross,No.
133,Rachel,"Ohhhh, come on!!"
134,Monica,I think she's here.
135,Rachel,No!
136,Rachel,Wait!
137,Rachel,Wait-wait!
138,Rachel,"Ross, please!"
139,Ross,"You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie."
140,Monica,"Ohh, she's looking down the hall."
141,Monica,Oh!
142,Monica,She looked right at me!
143,Monica,"Oh wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you?"
144,Monica,Hello!
145,Rachel,I'll be right there!
146,Rachel,"Okay, Ross, please come on!"
147,Rachel,I thought we have moved on!
148,Rachel,I thought we've gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other!
149,Rachel,I mean was that just me?
150,Ross,"All right, I'll do it."
151,Rachel,Oh thank you!
152,Rachel,"Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
153,Rachel,Emily?
154,Rachel,I'm Rachel Green.
155,Rachel,There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans.
156,Rachel,It turns out that I'm not free tonight.
157,Rachel,So
158,Rachel,"Oh well, no I"
159,Monica,I-I-I think you look great.
160,Rachel,I'll get her.
161,Ross,Please hurry.
162,Phoebe,Don't you just love the way they talk?
163,Phoebe,Ohh!
164,Monica,What?
165,Phoebe,It kicked!
166,Phoebe,I think the baby kicked!
167,Monica,Oh my God!
168,Phoebe,"Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted."
169,Joey,Oh my God!
170,Joey,I overslept!
171,Joey,I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago!
172,Joey,I gotta get out of here!
173,Monica,"Oh wait, Joey, you can't go like that!"
174,Monica,You stink!
175,Joey,"Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time!"
176,Joey,"They're just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it."
177,Monica,Yeah.
178,Monica,"Run ten blocks, that'll help the smell."
179,Rachel,"Heywhoa, slow down."
180,Rachel,"No, keep moving."
181,Rachel,Wow!
182,Monica,So?
183,Monica,How did it go with Joshua last night?
184,Rachel,"Well, I didn't see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face."
185,Monica,What?
186,Phoebe,Why?
187,Rachel,"The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep."
188,Phoebe,Ohh!
189,Phoebe,"So, did you get to meet her?"
190,Rachel,"No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, ""I'm Rachel Greep!"
191,Rachel,"I'm Rachel Greep!"""
192,Rachel,and he let her right in.
193,Monica,So you hit her in the face?
194,Rachel,"No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her."
195,Rachel,Ohhh!
196,Rachel,"I can't believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me."
197,Phoebe,"Aww, Pheebs."
198,Rachel,"Honey, that's you're name."
199,Phoebe,That's short for Phoebe?!
200,Phoebe,I thought that was just what we called each other!
201,Monica,Hey!
202,Monica,You're wearing pants!
203,Chandler,That's right!
204,Chandler,Where are the guys?
205,Chandler,I'm ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
206,Monica,It's
207,Chandler,They got a breakfast buffet.
208,Monica,Hello.
209,Monica,"Oh, hey Ross!"
210,Chandler,"Ooh, let me talk to him!"
211,Monica,"Oh-oh, my God!"
212,Chandler,"Well, can I just"
213,Monica,Shh!!
214,Monica,"Wait, what?"
215,Chandler,She's shhing me!
216,Chandler,It's my phone and she's shhing me!
217,Phoebe,Shhh!!

219,Phoebe,What's he saying?
220,Monica,He's with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!

226,Rachel,They're in Vermont!!
227,Rachel,How could this happen?
228,Chandler,Ow!
229,Rachel,Howhow did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?
230,Chandler,"Maybe, she doesn't hit him all the time."
231,Ross,"When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet!"
232,Ross,Who wouldn't be miserable?
233,Ross,"I'm telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person."
234,Ross,"I've gotta go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!"
235,Monica,"He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard."
236,Rachel,I don't get this!
237,Rachel,She was horrible!
238,Chandler,"Okay, I'm going to go stand over there."
239,Monica,Why do you care so much anyway?
240,Rachel,I don't care!
241,Rachel,"All right, y'know what I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua thaty'know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!"
242,Monica,"Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail."
243,Rachel,"Oh, y'know, would you just for once, not remember everylittlething!"
244,Chandler,"So y'know, uh, when's he getting back?"
245,Monica,A couple of days.
246,Chandler,"Y'know, I knew something like this was going to happen."
247,Monica,What are you doing?!
248,Monica,Chandler!
249,Monica,You can't just go back a phase!
250,Chandler,Yes you can.
251,Chandler,"You're thinking about time, you can't go back in time."
252,Phoebe,"Well, look, why don't you just, why don't you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us."
253,Monica,"Yeah, come on, we can be guys!"
254,Chandler,No you can't.
255,Phoebe,Come on!
256,Phoebe,Let us be guys!
257,Phoebe,Maybe we want to be guys!
258,Chandler,"You don't want to be guys, you'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long."
259,Phoebe,"Y'know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!"
260,Chandler,Okay.
261,Phoebe,I'm sorry.
262,Joey,Hey!

264,Joey,I'm here!

271,Joey,What smells so bad?
272,Joey,The A.D

275,Joey,"No-no, it's uh, it's Heston."
276,Joey,The A.D
277,Joey,"Yeah, the man wreaks!"
278,Joey,Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.
279,Joey,The A.D
280,Joey,"Really, a shower huh?"
281,Joey,"And uh, which-which room might that be?"

290,Phoebe,"I really, really enjoyed it."
291,Phoebe,Very exotic.
292,Rachel,"Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn't call."
293,Rachel,I mean you'd think he'd be worried about me not showing up at his club.
294,Rachel,"Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!"
295,Phoebe,Come on!
296,Phoebe,Look where you are!

305,Chandler,That was a test!
306,Chandler,In a couple of hours I'm gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me!
307,Chandler,"And then after that, I'm gonna get so drunk, I'm gonna wanna call Janice"
308,Phoebe,You should!
309,Phoebe,How is she?
310,Chandler,Ohhh!

334,Rachel,I can't believe it!
335,Rachel,He still hasn't called.
336,Phoebe,"Who, Josh?"
337,Rachel,It's Joshua.
338,Monica,"What, he doesn't like Josh?"

344,Phoebe,"Okay, y'know what, you were right, you were right."
345,Phoebe,"We really weren't great at being guys, but you know why?"
346,Phoebe,Because we're girls.
347,Chandler,Yeah?
348,Phoebe,And do you know what girls are really good at?
349,Chandler,Stripping!
350,Phoebe,"No, listening!"
351,Phoebe,Sit!

353,Rachel,"Yeah, come on!"
354,Rachel,What's going in on in there?
355,Monica,Yeah.
356,Monica,"And y'know, if you wanna cry, that's okay too."

360,Chandler,"Look, forget it."
361,Chandler,"We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay?"
362,Chandler,"Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn't picture myself with any of them."
363,Monica,"They really were pretty, weren't they?"
364,Phoebe,"Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one."
365,Monica,"Oh, Candy!"
366,Monica,She was so spunky!

368,Monica,"Y'know, I think if I were going to be with a woman."

44,Ross,I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
45,Ross,Chandler and

47,Ross,"No, no, with him."
48,Ross,"I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me."
49,Joey,Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
50,Ross,"Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us."
51,Ross,"And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field."
52,Chandler,What are you crazy?
53,Chandler,That's a baby!
54,Joey,He should take the sack?
55,Ross,"Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right?"
56,Ross,"Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up."
57,Ross,"See I, I am so not ready to be a father."
58,Chandler,"Hey, you're gonna be fine."
59,Chandler,"You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America."
60,Chandler,You're gonna make a great dad.
61,Joey,"Yeah, Ross."
62,Joey,You and the baby just need better blocking.
63,Joey,"Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room?"
64,Joey,Is it real expensive?
65,Chandler,"Well, only if you order stuff."
66,Joey,I'm takin' Ursula tonight.

70,Joey,When's that?
71,Ross,Tonight.

74,Ross,You take your time.
75,Chandler,There it is!
76,Chandler,So what're you gonna do?
77,Joey,What can I do?
78,Joey,"Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula."
79,Chandler,And your friend Phoebe?
80,Joey,"Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand."
81,Joey,"I mean, wouldn't you guys?"
82,Chandler,"Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit."
83,Monica,Yes?

95,Monica,"I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital."
96,Monica,It's like returning to the scene of the crime.
97,Monica,"You know, I say we blow off the dates."

323,Joey,no.
324,Joey,"No, I, I couldn't do that."
325,Phoebe,"Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe!"

91,Monica,Why don't we just find a place for it?
92,Chandler,Okay.
93,Chandler,How about in that cabinet?

102,Chandler,"It's locked, you have to help me."

120,Phoebe,Why won't you let me massage you?
121,Monica,Well it'sI mean I'd justI'd be self-conscious.
122,Monica,You're my friend; I'd be naked.

124,Phoebe,We lived together for years!
125,Phoebe,I've seen you naked!
126,Monica,"That's different, we were roommates!"

196,Chandler,I don't know!
197,Chandler,What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can't see?
198,Joey,I don't know.
199,Joey,"Ooh, I bet it's Richard."

250,Joey,Oh hey-hey!
251,Ross,Is everything okay?
252,Rachel,"Yeah, everything's fine!"
253,Ross,"Your page said come to the hospital, what?"
254,Ross,What was it?
255,Ross,What happened?
256,Joey,Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.
257,Ross,Oh.
258,Ross,Oh.
259,Ross,"Thank God, most women don't even feel them."
260,Rachel,"Okay, no uterus, no opinion."
261,Joey,"Hey uh, what's with the candy?"
262,Ross,Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.
263,Rachel,Oh you went to the movies by yourself?
264,Ross,No IMona!
265,Rachel,"Oh, I gotta go back in there."
266,Ross,What?
267,Ross,Why?
268,Ross,What's wrong?
269,Rachel,"No, everything's fine."
270,Rachel,I just gotta go back
271,Ross,"No really, you tell me what's up."
272,Rachel,I-I forgot my underwear.
273,Ross,"So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital."
274,Joey,"Oh hey, don't worry about it man."
275,Joey,"Don't worry about it, no big deal."
276,Ross,"Yeah but still, I mean it should've been me."
277,Ross,I'm the dad.
278,Ross,Dr.
279,Joey,"Oh uh, hey."
280,Joey,Not as good as this guy!
281,Joey,He brought Twizlers!
282,Joey,Commercial Break
283,Chandler,There has got to be a way!
284,Joey,Easy there Captain Kirk.
285,Joey,"Oh, do you have a bobby pin?"
286,Chandler,Yeah.
287,Chandler,"Oh no wait, I'm not an nine-year-old girl."
288,Joey,Then why do you throw like one?
289,Chandler,Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
290,Joey,Sure.
291,Joey,"""Monica."""
292,Chandler,"So, how's the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?"
293,Joey,"Uh, really good."
294,Joey,Really good.
295,Joey,"Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now."
296,Joey,"Wow, you sure found that quick."
297,Joey,"I justI wish I didn't feel this way about Rachel anymore, y'know?"
298,Joey,I wish things could go back to normal.
299,Joey,"I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I thinkI think Ross feels left out."
300,Joey,Y'know?
301,Joey,"When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father."
302,Joey,God You should've seen the look on Ross's face.
303,Joey,"By the way, I have no idea what I'm doing here."
304,Joey,For all I know I'm just locking it more.
305,Joey,"Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?"
306,Chandler,That's a good idea.
307,Joey,Yeah.
308,Chandler,Okay.
309,Chandler,"So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?"
310,Joey,"Oh, I justI feel terrible."
311,Chandler,"Well, it's not your fault."
312,Chandler,What are you gonna do?
313,Chandler,Not take her to the hospital?
314,Chandler,Y'know?
315,Chandler,You're doing nothing wrong.
316,Chandler,Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby.
317,Chandler,Richard?
318,Chandler,"If-if you're in there, could you pass me my credit card?"
319,Monica,Hey.
320,Phoebe,Hey.
321,Monica,"I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing."
322,Monica,That massage felt so good!
323,Phoebe,"No-no, I got that."
324,Monica,"So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?"
325,Phoebe,Okay.
326,Phoebe,"Okay but you should know though, I've raised my rates to $200 an hour."
327,Monica,Okay.
328,Phoebe,I mean $500.
329,Monica,What?
330,Phoebe,600.
331,Monica,What's going on?
332,Phoebe,"Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!"
333,Monica,What?
334,Phoebe,"Yeah, and it really freaked me out!"
335,Phoebe,And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.
336,Monica,What?!
337,Monica,You're crazy!
338,Monica,There's nothing sexual about the noises I make!
339,Phoebe,Really?
340,Phoebe,There's nothing sexual about this?
341,Phoebe,Oooh.
342,Phoebe,Oo God!
343,Phoebe,Ohh.
344,Phoebe,Ohhhh.
345,Phoebe,Ohh.
346,Phoebe,What are you looking at?!
347,Phoebe,I mean hi.
348,Monica,Oh myThis is so embarrassing.
349,Monica,"Oh my God, I'm never gonna get massaged again!"
350,Phoebe,"No, you can't let this stop you from getting massages!"
351,Phoebe,"No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!"
352,Monica,Really?
353,Phoebe,"Well not clients, lovers."
354,Phoebe,"But let's just y'know, try it again."
355,Phoebe,Come back and-and we'll work through it.
356,Monica,Are you sure?
357,Phoebe,Yes.
358,Monica,I guess.
359,Phoebe,Great!
360,Phoebe,"Okay, if you'll just excuse me."
361,Phoebe,"So, did you hear something you liked?"
362,Rachel,Hey Ross!
363,Rachel,Check it out!
364,Rachel,I learned a new trick!
365,Ross,"Hey uh, I brought you some lunch."
366,Rachel,Ohh!
367,Rachel,That's so sweet of you!
368,Rachel,Oh yum!
369,Rachel,Did you put pickles on this?
370,Ross,Well yeah!
371,Rachel,Oh Ross!
372,Ross,What?!
373,Ross,What?!
374,Ross,Rach what?
375,Joey,What's going on?
376,Ross,"I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles."
377,Joey,Pickle?
378,Joey,Pickles make her sick.
379,Joey,Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.
380,Ross,"I-I'm sorry Rach, I didn't know."
381,Ross,Are you gonna be okay?
382,Rachel,"Yeah, I'll be fine."
383,Rachel,But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?
384,Joey,I'm on it!
385,Ross,I can't believe this!
386,Ross,I shouldn't be the one making her throw up!
387,Joey,Dude relax!
388,Joey,It could happen to anyone.
389,Ross,Yeah?
390,Ross,"Not to you, because you know this stuff."
391,Ross,I don't know any of it and I'm the father.
392,Ross,I wish I'd be more involved y'know.
393,Rachel,"Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna."
394,Joey,"Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?"
395,Ross,Yeah.
396,Rachel,What's up?
397,Joey,"Uh, sit down."
398,Joey,I wanna talk about our situation.
399,Rachel,Are you breaking up with us?
400,Joey,"The thing is'cause I live with Rachel I'm here for a lot of the stuff, okay?"
401,Joey,And RossRoss is missing everything.
402,Joey,So
403,Rachel,Yeah?
404,Joey,Maybe you two should live together.
405,Rachel,Are you asking me to move out?
406,Rachel,Do you not want me here?
407,Joey,"Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you."
408,Joey,"It just seems thatif you're gonna have a roommate, y'know it might as well be the father."
409,Rachel,"But Joey, I don't think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that."
410,Rachel,I meanOr he does.
411,Ross,No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby.
412,Ross,And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.
413,Rachel,"But Ross, its you and me!"
414,Ross,So?
415,Ross,Sure!
416,Ross,But it-it wouldn't be anything romantic.
417,Ross,And I'm-I'm dating MonaDamnit Mona!
418,Ross,I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago!
419,Ross,What is wrong with me?
420,Joey,"All right now, so?"
421,Joey,What do you think?
422,Rachel,I don't know.
423,Rachel,Is it crazy?
424,Ross,No!
425,Ross,No it's not.
426,Ross,"Joey, this is a smart idea."
427,Joey,"Well, I was due."
428,Rachel,"Okay, let's do it."
429,Rachel,I'll move in.
430,Ross,Really?
431,Rachel,Yeah.
432,Ross,Oh Rach that's great.
433,Ross,That's great.
434,Chandler,"Not to shabby, I got this all off myselfusing my wife's tools."
435,Chandler,Oh my God!
436,Monica,How did you get in there?
437,Chandler,You're messy.
438,Monica,Oh no!
439,Monica,You weren't supposed to see this!
440,Chandler,I married Fred Sanford!
441,Monica,"No Chandler, you don't understand!"
442,Monica,Okay!
443,Monica,Okay!
444,Monica,Okay!
445,Monica,Fine!
446,Monica,Now you know.
447,Monica,Okay?
448,Monica,I'm y'knowI'm sick.
449,Chandler,"No, honey you're not sick!"
450,Chandler,"Look, I don't love you because you're organized, I love you in spite of that."
451,Monica,Really?
452,Monica,You promise you won't tell anyone?
453,Chandler,Yes!
454,Chandler,"And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet."
455,Monica,Wellit's just ummI'm afraid you might mess it up.
456,Chandler,Hey.
457,Joey,Hey.
458,Chandler,So Rachel's all moved out huh?
459,Chandler,How are you taking it?
460,Joey,"Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldn't stand the smell of them."
461,Joey,But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though.
462,Joey,"And uh, it's a couple weeks past it's expiration date, so it's got a bit of a kick."
463,Chandler,Are you okay?
464,Joey,Are you kidding me?
465,Joey,I'm great!
466,Joey,"Yeah, I'm uh; I'm better than great."
467,Joey,I am good.
468,Joey,"And now that she's gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldn't do before."
469,Joey,Y'know?
470,Joey,"Like umm, I can walk around naked again."
471,Joey,Y'know?
472,Joey,"I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room."
473,Joey,Right?
474,Joey,"This is uh, this is good for me."
475,Joey,Y'know?
476,Joey,"I like being on my own, I'm uh, better off this way."
477,Joey,"I'm uh, a lone wolf."
478,Joey,Y'know?
479,Joey,A loner.
480,Joey,Alone.
481,Joey,All alone.
482,Joey,Forever.

7,Chandler,I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
8,Joey,"Look, we're not throwing it out!"
9,Joey,I built this thing with my own hands!
10,Chandler,"All right, how about we, how bout we sell it."

20,Ross,The guy who took Rachel to the prom?
21,Ross,Why is he calling you?
22,Monica,"Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute."
23,Ross,"Monica, you're so lucky!"
24,Ross,He's like the most popular guy in school!

34,Ross,I was just leaving.
35,Rachel,Good!
36,Rachel,"Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep."
37,Ross,Why?
38,Ross,Did you write it?
39,Rachel,Wow!
40,Rachel,"Look at that, Chip Matthews called."
41,Rachel,I wonder what he wants?
42,Ross,"Well ah, actually..."
43,Rachel,I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
44,Ross,"Well, umm, why don't you give him a call?"
45,Rachel,Okay.
46,Rachel,Are you sure you wanna hear this?
47,Ross,"Oh, I'm sure."

57,Ross,That-that's gotta be embarrassing!
58,Phoebe,"...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!!"
59,Phoebe,"Thank you, thanks."
60,Ross,"Hey, here's a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?"
61,Chandler,"Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land."
62,Ross,I'm reading your ad.
63,Joey,"Looks good, uh?"
64,Ross,Yeah.
65,Chandler,Stunning entertainment center.
66,Chandler,"Fine,  fine Italian craftsmanship."
67,Phoebe,"Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?"
68,Rachel,Why?
69,Rachel,I love that thing.
70,Chandler,You want it?
71,Chandler,Phoebe and
72,Rachel,Oh no.
73,Chandler,"Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars?"
74,Chandler,Are you insane?
75,Joey,"Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!"
76,Chandler,"All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer."
77,Joey,What kind of profit is that?!
78,Joey,And you call yourself an accountant.
79,Chandler,Nooo.
80,Joey,Oh.
81,Joey,What do you do?
82,Chandler,I can't believe you don't know what I do for a living!
83,Phoebe,"Yeah, I actually don't know..."
84,Ross,"Good, so do I"
85,Rachel,Something to do with numbers?
86,Phoebe,Oh my God!
87,Phoebe,No!
88,Phoebe,Shoo!
89,Phoebe,Kitty!
90,Phoebe,No!
91,Phoebe,No-no-no!
92,Phoebe,Shoo!
93,Phoebe,"Come on, you!"
94,Phoebe,Come on.
95,Phoebe,Crazy.
96,Phoebe,Oh my God.
97,Rachel,What?
98,Phoebe,Nothing.
99,Phoebe,Nothing.
100,Joey,What?
101,Joey,What's wrong?
102,Phoebe,"I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother."
103,Rachel,You mean the mom you met in Montauk.
104,Rachel,She was a cat?
105,Phoebe,"No, no-no, she was a human lady."
106,Phoebe,"This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself."
107,Ross,"Are you sure she's in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma's glycoma medicine again?"
108,Phoebe,No Dr. Skeptismo!
109,Phoebe,I'm sure.
110,Phoebe,"First of all, okay, there's the feeling."
111,Phoebe,"Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt."
112,Phoebe,My Mother's favourite fish is Orange Roughy...  Cats....like....fish!
113,Phoebe,"Hi, Mommy."
114,Phoebe,"Oh, I haven't seen this smile in 17 years!"
115,Joey,"Dude, Phoebe's mom has got a huge peni..."
116,Chandler,Let it go!
117,Monica,Hey!
118,Rachel,"Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?"
119,Monica,Now?
120,Monica,Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
121,Rachel,Nooo!
122,Rachel,It's not okay!
123,Rachel,I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me!
124,Monica,"What, that little thing at the prom?"
125,Rachel,Monica!
126,Rachel,I couldn't find him for two hours!
127,Rachel,He was having sex with Amy Welch!
128,Monica,"Come on, that was back in high school!"
129,Monica,How could that still bother you?
130,Rachel,"I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?"
131,Monica,"Look, you and I went to different high schools..."
132,Rachel,"Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school."
133,Monica,"You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket."
134,Monica,I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
135,Rachel,They had to have that specially made?
136,Monica,It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
137,Rachel,"Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!"
138,Monica,"Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out."
139,Monica,And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go.
140,Monica,I-I owe her this.
141,Monica,I never let her eat.
142,Rachel,"Oh, you go out with him."
143,Monica,"Oh, really?"
144,Rachel,Yeah.
145,Rachel,"Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?"
146,Monica,I'll try.
147,Ross,So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
148,Joey,"Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out."
149,Chandler,"Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process."
150,Chandler,"Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails."
151,Phoebe,Stop it!
152,Phoebe,Stop it!
153,Phoebe,"She keeps squirming, trying to get away!"
154,Phoebe,Just like when she was alive.
155,Ross,"So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?"
156,Phoebe,"Well, I'm not sure."
157,Phoebe,"I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there's y'know, a new mom."
158,Phoebe,"Y'know, I think she's worried that y'know, she's gonna, she's gonna be replaced."
159,Phoebe,"Well, that's not gonna happen is it?"
160,Phoebe,Noo.
161,Phoebe,"Okay, I have to return a call in the other room."
162,Monica,Why can't you use the phone in here?
163,Phoebe,"Well, I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H."
164,Phoebe,I just spelled the wrong word.
165,Ross,"So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe's mom remind anyone of a cat?"
166,Monica,"Ross, don't start."
167,Ross,"Come on, you-you can't tell me you actually believe that-that there's a woman inside that cat!"
168,Rachel,I believe it.
169,Ross,No you don't.
170,Rachel,"Yes, I do."
171,Ross,"No you doy'know what, you're not gonna suck me into this."
172,Rachel,"Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right."
173,Ross,"I do not always have to beokay, okay."
174,Rachel,Jurassic Park could happen.
175,Joey,Pretty nice?
176,Chandler,"You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this."
177,Chandler,"Y'know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe."
178,Chandler,"All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!"
179,Joey,Good for you!
180,Rachel,"You guys, you're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole!"
181,Rachel,Look kinda familiar?
182,Ross,Apparently Phoebe's mother also goes by the name Julio.
183,Rachel,"You guys, there's a little girl in Soho looking for this cat."
184,Rachel,"I mean, you know what that means?"
185,Joey,Yeah-eah!
186,Joey,"200 dollar reward, split five ways!"
187,Rachel,Do we have to tell her?
188,Ross,"Yes, we have to tell her!"
189,Monica,"Oh, but it's made her so happy."
190,Ross,Little girl misses her cat.
191,Ross,Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.
192,Ross,"Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her."
193,Ross,Thank you.
194,Rachel,I hate when Ross is right!
195,Monica,"He is right, isn't he?"
196,Chandler,"Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he's wrong."
197,Chandler,"Oh-no, he's right."
198,Chandler,Commercial Break
199,Phoebe,Hi.
200,Monica,Hi!
201,Joey,"Uh, Pheebs, about your mom..."
202,Phoebe,Yeah?
203,Joey,How's that going?
204,Phoebe,So great.
205,Phoebe,"Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred."
206,Joey,That's so sweet.
207,Joey,I'm gonna get some coffee.
208,Monica,Huh?
209,Monica,What'd ya say Joe?
210,Monica,I'll be right there.

226,Rachel,I'm great.
227,Rachel,"I've got a great job at Bloomingdale's, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I'm not seeing anyone right now, I've never felt better about myself."
228,Rachel,She'll be out in a second.
229,Rachel,"So, Chip, how's umm, Amy Welch?"
230,Joey,This is the unit for you my friend.
231,Joey,"Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man."
232,Joey,Oh yeah!
233,Joey,I got in there myself once.
234,Joey,"My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in."
235,Joey,Yeah.
236,Joey,It was funny til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
237,Joey,Oh yeah?
238,Joey,"If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit."
239,Joey,Okay.
240,Joey,See?!

242,Joey,Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it!
243,Joey,"Hey, a nickel!"
244,Monica,Oh my God!

246,Monica,"That's what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school."
247,Monica,"Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you're Chip."
248,Monica,Nevermind.
249,Monica,Wow!
250,Monica,A lipper from Chipper.
251,Monica,Umm.

264,Chandler,What the hell happened?!!
265,Chandler,How were you locked in?!!
266,Chandler,And where the hell is all of our stuff?!
267,Joey,"Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!"
268,Chandler,SoYou got in voluntarily?
269,Joey,I was tryin' to make a sale!!
270,Joey,"Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?"
271,Chandler,BEND OVER?!!
272,Monica,"Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else?"
273,Monica,"Like you, I don't even know where you work?"
274,Monica,I do?
275,Monica,You still work at the multiplex?
276,Monica,"Thanks, I'm set."

285,Joey,"Oh, no-no-no, here it is!"
286,Monica,Oh my God!
287,Monica,What happened?
288,Chandler,"Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!"
289,Rachel,"So, how was your date?"
290,Monica,"Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?"
291,Rachel,Um-hmm.
292,Monica,"Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school."
293,Rachel,"Oh honey, I'm sorry."
294,Monica,"No, it's okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews."
295,Rachel,Ohh!
296,Rachel,That's so great!
297,Monica,I know!
298,Ross,Hey!
299,Ross,"So ah, what did the insurance company say?"
300,Chandler,"Oh, they said uh, You don't have insurance here, so stop calling us."
301,Ross,You didn't tell her?!
302,Ross,"Okay, fine!"
303,Ross,Pheebs?
304,Phoebe,Yeah?
305,Phoebe,Hi!
306,Ross,Hi!
307,Ross,"Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl."
308,Ross,There are flyers all over the place.
309,Rachel,"I'm sorry, sweetie."
310,Monica,"Hey, we can take her back with you if you want."
311,Phoebe,Ohh.
312,Phoebe,Um-hmm.
313,Phoebe,"But y'know, she choose to find me."
314,Phoebe,"I mean, I have to respect her decision."
315,Phoebe,Right?
316,Phoebe,"Chandler, Monica, Joey, and"
317,Rachel,That's a good call.
318,Rachel,Right.
319,Ross,No!
320,Ross,No!
321,Ross,"LookHey, enough is enough!"
322,Ross,"Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom."
323,Ross,This is a cat!
324,Ross,"Okay, Julio the cat!"
325,Ross,Not mom!
326,Ross,Cat!
327,Phoebe,"Ross, how many parents have you lost?"
328,Ross,None.
329,Phoebe,"Okay, then you don't know what it feels like when one of them comes back."
330,Phoebe,Do you?
331,Phoebe,I believe this is my Mother.
332,Phoebe,"Even if I'm wrong, who cares?"
333,Phoebe,Just be a friend.
334,Phoebe,Okay?
335,Phoebe,Be supportive.
336,Ross,I'm sorry.
337,Phoebe,Okay.
338,Ross,I don't know what to say.
339,Rachel,You could.... say you're sorry to her mom.
340,Phoebe,I think she would like that.
341,Ross,"Come here, here, come here, come here,  Mrs. Buffay."
342,Ross,"Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat."
343,Ross,"When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend's mother."
344,Phoebe,Thank you.
345,Phoebe,We both forgive you.
346,Rachel,"So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?"
347,Phoebe,"Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me."
348,Phoebe,And you're welcome to come back anytime.
349,Chandler,"Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it."
350,Phoebe,"Come on, Mom, I'll take you home."
351,Rachel,I'll go with you.
352,Monica,Me too.
353,Ross,Oh!
354,Ross,"Y'know, I've got an extra futon."

7,Joey,"You've got to spread it out a little, you know."
8,Joey,Haven't you ever been unemployed?
9,Ross,"Hey, I am not unemployed."
10,Ross,I'm on sabbatical!
11,Joey,"Hey, don't get religious on me, ok.  A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing."

14,Joey,Huh...come heresit down.

41,Chandler,Ohh.
42,Phoebe,"Yeah, yeah, I'm going to be out there spreading joy to the people."

44,Phoebe,"So this year, I'm going to do the whole city."
45,Monica,"You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that."
46,Monica,She was very popular.
47,Joey,"So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?"
48,Phoebe,"Ohh, they gave me a great spot."
49,Phoebe,Right by Macys.
50,Phoebe,"Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I'm the only one who can sing ""Merry Christmas"" in 25 languages."
51,Phoebe,I lied.
52,Rachel,Oh my god.
53,Rachel,"Ok you guys, there's Danny."
54,Rachel,Watch.
55,Rachel,Just watch this.
56,Rachel,See?!
57,Rachel,Still pretending he's not interested.
58,Rachel,"Ohh, he's coming over."
59,Rachel,Just pretend like we don't know him.
60,Rachel,We've forgotten who he is.
61,Monica,Danny?
62,Monica,You know Rachel?
63,Monica,She's nice.
64,Monica,"She's not bad to look at, right?"

71,Rachel,You know what?
72,Rachel,Don't answer me.
73,Rachel,I have a date with Danny.
74,Joey,How could I not get the part?
75,Joey,The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.
76,Joey,She's a woman!
77,Joey,"Okay, is there anything else?"
78,Phoebe,Happy Holidays.
79,Phoebe,Feliz Navidad.

88,Phoebe,"Oh, thanks!"
89,Monica,Yeah!
90,Phoebe,Wow!

92,Phoebe,It looks really expensive.
93,Monica,Yeah.
94,Monica,I guess.
95,Phoebe,Just get your nails done?
96,Monica,"Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have."
97,Monica,Okay?
98,Phoebe,Okay!
99,Phoebe,Thanks!
100,Phoebe,"Happy Holidays, here's your joy."

102,Phoebe,And Happy Holidays.
103,Phoebe,"Wait, you can't take the money out."
104,Phoebe,The

106,Phoebe,This money is for the poor.
107,Phoebe,The
108,Phoebe,"Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still The"
109,Phoebe,"Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just"
110,Joey,That part was perfect for me!
111,Joey,I can't believe I didn't get it!
112,Ross,"I'm sorry, man."
113,Ross,"Hey, y'know what you should do?"
114,Ross,You should make something happen for yourself.
115,Ross,"Y'know, like-like write a play."
116,Ross,Write a movie!
117,Ross,Huh?
118,Ross,"I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?"
119,Joey,"Come on Ross be realistic, y'know?"
120,Joey,"If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?"
121,Joey,"Wait a second, I could star in it!"
122,Ross,Or that.
123,Joey,I can't write!
124,Joey,"Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know?"
125,Joey,I can't do it.
126,Ross,I'll help you.
127,Ross,"Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it."
128,Ross,"And plus, it'll give me something to do."
129,Joey,Really?
130,Joey,You'd-you'd do that for me?
131,Ross,Yeah!
132,Joey,Thanks!
133,Ross,"All right, we'll start off slow."
134,Ross,The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
135,Joey,Done!
136,Ross,And it can't be Joey.
137,Joey,It's not.
138,Ross,Or Joseph.
139,Joey,Oh.
140,Monica,"Hey, what's up?"
141,Rachel,I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
142,Monica,"Oh, honey, I'm sorry."
143,Rachel,"Well, you should be, this is all your fault!"
144,Rachel,You meddled in our relationship!
145,Monica,You had no relationship!
146,Rachel,"No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!"
147,Monica,"Oh God, stop with the plan!"
148,Monica,"So what, so what you saw him with a girl?"
149,Monica,Who cares?!
150,Monica,That doesn't mean anything!
151,Monica,"Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl."
152,Rachel,She was kinda stupid.
153,Rachel,You're right.
154,Rachel,"All right, I'm just gonna go on the date."
155,Rachel,I'm gonna go on the date.
156,Rachel,That is the new plan.
157,Monica,"Come on, hurry!"
158,Joey,"Hey, how do you spell suspicious?"
159,Chandler,Why?
160,Joey,Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
161,Chandler,Yes!
162,Chandler,"Chandler Bing, 7!"
163,Chandler,"Chandler Bing, 0."
164,Joey,You're driving me crazy with that!
165,Chandler,"Okay, I'll stop."
166,Joey,Don't stop!
167,Joey,Move the bowl further away!
168,Joey,Ross could make that shot!
169,Joey,"Well, you suck!"
170,Joey,But at least you suck at a man's game now.
171,Chandler,You wanna play?
172,Joey,"Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon."
173,Joey,And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
174,Chandler,"Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home."
175,Joey,All right!
176,Joey,"But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?"
177,Chandler,I'm intrigued.
178,Joey,"All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid."
179,Chandler,"Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back."
180,Joey,"Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts."
181,Chandler,Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
182,Joey,"Uh yeah, right here."
183,Phoebe,"Thank you, Happy Holidays."
184,Phoebe,"Now, that's trash."
185,Phoebe,"Young lady, you can't  Hey!"
186,Phoebe,"Stop that young lady, she donated trash!"
187,Phoebe,Hey!!
188,Phoebe,The charity's on fire!
189,Phoebe,Help!
190,Phoebe,Oh good!
191,Phoebe,"Thank you, I need that."
192,Phoebe,Whoa!
193,Phoebe,What is that?!
194,Phoebe,It's nine o'clock in the morning!
195,Ross,All right.
196,Ross,A room.
197,Ross,"A man enters, he looks suspicious."
198,Ross,That's it?
199,Ross,"Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now!"
200,Ross,Including an exciting incident!
201,Ross,"And what is, and what is all this?!"
202,Ross,The official rulebook of Fireball.
203,Joey,"Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing."
204,Chandler,"Oh yeah, it's great!"
205,Chandler,"See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluidOp!"
206,Chandler,Op!
207,Ross,This is helping your career?!
208,Ross,Huh?
209,Ross,I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
210,Joey,"You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work."
211,Ross,And shame on you!
212,Ross,"You should know better, Joey needs to work."
213,Ross,Now come on!
214,Joey,Hey!
215,Ross,No!
216,Ross,Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!
217,Ross,You can have this back when the five pages are done!
218,Ross,Ahh!
219,Rachel,So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
220,Rachel,You're sister?
221,Rachel,You're sister's asleep on the couch?
222,Rachel,Ohhh!
223,Rachel,I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!
224,Rachel,Danny's
225,Rachel,Hi!
226,Rachel,"Uh, it was very nice meeting you."
227,Rachel,Commercial Break
228,Phoebe,Nobody!
229,Phoebe,Nobody respects the bucket!
230,Phoebe,You wouldn't believe what people put in here!
231,Phoebe,Look!
232,Phoebe,"Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?"
233,Monica,No.
234,Phoebe,Does it look like an ashtray?
235,Monica,No.
236,Phoebe,Does it look like a urinal?
237,Monica,Eww!
238,Ross,"So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?"
239,Phoebe,"Well, yeah!"
240,Phoebe,But I'm not gonna take anymore crap.
241,Phoebe,Okay?
242,Phoebe,No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!
243,Monica,"Yeah, good for you."
244,Monica,"Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets."
245,Phoebe,"Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe."
246,Phoebe,Yeah!
247,Phoebe,"Oh but, y'know what?"
248,Phoebe,I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys.
249,Phoebe,Sorry.
250,Rachel,Hey!
251,Monica,Hey!
252,Rachel,"Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?"
253,Rachel,Monica and
254,Ross,Sure.
255,Rachel,"Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?"
256,Ross,"Oh-oh, yeah."
257,Monica,All the time.
258,Monica,"In fact, I was undefeated."
259,Ross,"Uh, you weighted 200 pounds."
260,Monica,"Still, I was quick as a cat."
261,Rachel,"Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway."
262,Monica,"Oh, you're kidding."
263,Rachel,"Yeah, they were very y'knowwrestley."
264,Rachel,"But, I guess that's normal?"
265,Monica,"We don't, we don't wrestle now."
266,Ross,"Yeah, not since I got too strong for you."
267,Monica,Too strong for me?
268,Ross,Yeah.
269,Monica,You wanna go right now?
270,Monica,"'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy!"
271,Monica,You wanna go?
272,Ross,Oh fine.
273,Monica,Ready?
274,Monica,Wrestle!
275,Rachel,"Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great."
276,Rachel,That helps a lot.
277,Rachel,Thanks.
278,Chandler,"Guys, come on!"
279,Chandler,Let's go!
280,Chandler,The puck drops in 20 minutes!
281,Chandler,"Come on, Joe!"
282,Ross,Joey's not going.
283,Joey,I didn't finish my five pages.
284,Chandler,"Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?"
285,Ross,Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
286,Joey,Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
287,Chandler,Why don't you cut him a little slack?
288,Chandler,Okay?
289,Chandler,"Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done."
290,Ross,"I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball."
291,Joey,"Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played."
292,Chandler,The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored.
293,Chandler,"Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed."
294,Ross,I am not unemployed.
295,Ross,I'm on sabbatical!
296,Joey,"Come on look guys, don't fight."
297,Ross,And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend.
298,Ross,"And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing."
299,Chandler,"Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?"
300,Ross,If it does?
301,Ross,Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
302,Joey,"Hey-hey guys, hey!"
303,Joey,How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball?
304,Joey,Huh?
305,Joey,I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
306,Ross,How about we settle this right now!
307,Ross,There!
308,Ross,"Now, no one's going to the game."
309,Ross,Ha-ha-ha!
310,Chandler,I paid for those tickets!
311,Ross,No you didn't.
312,Ross,"You said you would, but you never did!"
313,Chandler,Oh yeah!
314,Joey,"Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time."
315,Chandler,When did that happen to you?
316,Joey,Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a pictureI didn't have my camera!
317,Chandler,Oh yeah.
318,Chandler,"First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging."
319,Rachel,"Oh, great!"
320,Chandler,"Okay, bye!"
321,Chandler,Oh my God!
322,Monica,That was unbelievable!
323,Rachel,"Okay, see?"
324,Rachel,I told you!
325,Joey,"Yeah, wow, sorry Rach."
326,Chandler,I don't believe they're brother and sister.
327,Joey,They're brother and sister!!
328,Phoebe,Oh whoa-whoa-whoa!
329,Phoebe,"Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look."
330,Phoebe,Quarter.
331,Phoebe,Dime.
332,Phoebe,Lint?
333,Phoebe,Not interested in that.
334,Phoebe,What's this?
335,Phoebe,A Canadian coin?
336,Phoebe,Get outta here!
337,Phoebe,Whoa-whoa-whoa!
338,Phoebe,No drinks near the bucket!
339,Phoebe,Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution!
340,Phoebe,And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too!
341,Phoebe,Hi Bob!
342,Phoebe,I thought I told you to get outta here!
343,Phoebe,What?
344,Phoebe,That chick can't handle my corner.
345,Phoebe,Fine.
346,Phoebe,"All right, I'll give you one pointer."
347,Phoebe,Look out for that bitch.
348,Rachel,"Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it."
349,Rachel,"Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and"
350,Rachel,"Well, okay, look."
351,Rachel,"I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's"
352,Rachel,"No, I have two sisters."
353,Rachel,But one of them has a very masculine energy.
354,Rachel,"No-no, they're not very nice people."

360,Ross,"Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball."
361,Joey,Hey guys!
362,Joey,I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
363,Ross,Yay!
364,Chandler,Great!
365,Chandler,"Now, we can go to the Ranger game!"
366,Chandler,Last night!
367,Joey,"No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!"
368,Ross,"I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus."
369,Ross,Huh?
370,Chandler,Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!
371,Joey,"Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it."
372,Joey,"And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it."
373,Joey,So would you guys read it for me?
374,Chandler,All right.

383,Ross,I am sorry.
384,Chandler,"No, it was me."
385,Chandler,I'm sorry.
386,Chandler,I over reacted.
387,Ross,"Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest  But we had our best friend's interest at heart."
388,Chandler,Could I be more sorry.
389,Ross,"I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist."
390,Ross,"All right Joey, we get it."
391,Ross,I'm sorry.
392,Chandler,I'm sorry too.
393,Joey,Oh no!
394,Joey,"No-no, keep reading!"

399,Joey,A handsome man enters.
400,Joey,Hey!
401,Joey,How's it going guys?
402,Joey,"I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you."
403,Joey,"You,  you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you  well you co-created Fireball."
404,Joey,The end.
405,Chandler,This took you all day?
406,Joey,"No-no, this only took five minutes."
407,Joey,"I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball."
408,Joey,Ha-ha!
409,Joey,Ending Credits
410,Joey,"Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment."
411,Joey,Two girls are just hanging out.

413,Rachel,I'm doing just fine!
414,Rachel,"God, Tiffany, you smell so great!"
415,Monica,It's my new perfume.
416,Monica,Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?
417,Rachel,"Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!"
418,Monica,This is disgusting!
419,Rachel,I'm not reading this!

14,Monica,OPENING CREDITS
15,Phoebe,I know!
16,Phoebe,"Yeah, I kinda do."
17,Phoebe,"Well,    how's this?"
18,Joey,"Aaahhh, look    at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious?"
19,Joey,Have you not talked about it yet?
20,Joey,Am I making you uncomfortable?
21,Joey,"If you were bigger you'd hit me,    huh...?"
22,Joey,Aaaaaahhhhhh
23,Phoebe,I'm sorry...
24,Phoebe,I'm sorry.
25,Phoebe,It's obviously way too early    for us to be... having that conversation.
26,Phoebe,"Maybe not, is it?"
27,Phoebe,"I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?"
28,Phoebe,"Oh, it's a key."
29,Phoebe,"To be honest, I think I'd prefer the    five dollars."
30,Phoebe,"Oh wow, ooh!"
31,Phoebe,"Ooh, big step for    Phoebe and Mike."
32,Phoebe,"Oh no, I want to."
33,Phoebe,Yeah... ooh... wow...
34,Phoebe,"Even started to think I'd never    meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with."
35,Phoebe,Here you go.
36,Phoebe,It really is.
37,Joey,"Oh, I know it..."
38,Joey,It    is amazing these little things open doors... huh!
39,Rachel,"So I don't go back to work for another four weeks,    but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance    to know her."
40,Rachel,Prospective
41,Rachel,"That's great, great."
42,Rachel,So do you have any questions    for us?
43,Rachel,Prospective
44,Rachel,Allright.
45,Rachel,Well thank you so much for coming...
46,Ross,Thank you.
47,Rachel,Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.
48,Rachel,Prospective
49,Ross,"Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that."
50,Ross,Prospective
51,Rachel,Okidoki!
52,Rachel,Wow!
53,Rachel,We're never gonna find a nanny.
54,Ross,"Oh, come on Rach, we will."
55,Ross,I promise.
56,Ross,"We have more interviews     And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider    the uhm... the first one we met with."
57,Rachel,"What, the blonde with no bra?"
58,Ross,She was blonde?
59,Ross,Just a sec.!
60,Ross,"Okay, okay."
61,Ross,This one's name is Sandy.
62,Ross,"She's got a degree    in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three    years."
63,Rachel,Okay...
64,Ross,And she's a little mannish...
65,Phoebe,Oh my God!
66,Phoebe,David!
67,Phoebe,No!
68,Phoebe,"It's a great time, come in...!"
69,Phoebe,"WOW,    hi... Oh my gosh!"
70,Phoebe,What are you doing here?
71,Phoebe,Are you back from Minsk?
72,Phoebe,"Who cares, it got you here."
73,Phoebe,Wow.
74,Phoebe,Where is your luggage?
75,Phoebe,"A-Allright, well..."
76,Phoebe,I'll call the cab company.
77,Phoebe,Thank you!
78,Phoebe,"God, no!"
79,Phoebe,"You should see me when... Oh actually,    no, I look pretty good."
80,Phoebe,No...
81,Phoebe,I'm...
82,Phoebe,I'm just...
83,Phoebe,I'm the worst person ever.
84,Phoebe,How    can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?
85,Monica,Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
86,Phoebe,He
87,Monica,"Oh, well... That had been your window."
88,Phoebe,Yeah!
89,Phoebe,"I mean, I don't know."
90,Phoebe,"I was just , I was looking,    I was looking in his eyes and I was just"
91,Monica,Really?
92,Monica,The scientist guy?
93,Phoebe,Really?
94,Phoebe,Chandler?
95,Monica,Continue...
96,Phoebe,"Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him    that I would see him tomorrow night."
97,Monica,Phoebe!
98,Phoebe,I know!
99,Phoebe,Evil!
100,Phoebe,And... and... and...
101,Phoebe,"I like Mike so much, you know."
102,Phoebe,It's just going really well.
103,Phoebe,Oh my God!
104,Monica,"Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the    same day that you and Mike exchange keys?"
105,Phoebe,Uhuh...
106,Phoebe,"Yeah...!, you know."
107,Phoebe,"And given    my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am."
108,Monica,What are you gonna do?
109,Phoebe,"I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that    nothing can happen between us."
110,Phoebe,"Unless I don't... You know, complicated    moral situation, no right, no wrong..."
111,Monica,You have to tell David!
112,Phoebe,"Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation    with Joey."
113,Chandler,Funniest guy she's ever met!
114,Chandler,"I'm funny, right...?"
115,Chandler,"What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock    jokes...  Save it for    inside!"
116,Monica,Heeeeeey!
117,Chandler,Hey!
118,Phoebe,Hey!
119,Chandler,So... Oklahoma is a crazy place.
120,Chandler,"You know, they    call it the Sooner state."
121,Chandler,Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state.
122,Chandler,And what's with Oklahoma    having a pan handle?
123,Chandler,Can all states have stuff like that?
124,Chandler,"Hey yeah, I'm from    the waistband, Wyoming."
125,Chandler,"But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch."
126,Monica,Was your cabin    pressurised?
127,Chandler,And don't get    me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.
128,Phoebe,Okay.
129,Chandler,What's with the word y'all?
130,Chandler,"You know, just... two    words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so,    I say why stop there?"
131,Chandler,"You know, your new poodle could be your noodle."
132,Chandler,And fried    chicken?
133,Chandler,"Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken?"
134,Chandler,"See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?"
135,Monica,"No, it just remind me of something this guy did today    at work."
136,Monica,"I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?"
137,Chandler,"Yeah, he came up..."
138,Monica,"Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there,    but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken."
139,Chandler,Were you there?
140,Phoebe,"No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny..."
141,Rachel,"Sandy, that's exactly what it is..."
142,Ross,Are you gay?
143,Rachel,Ross!
144,Rachel,Oh!
145,Rachel,"Oh, that's pretty."
146,Ross,So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?
147,Ross,Okay.
148,Ross,"Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap."
149,Rachel,"Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed."
150,Rachel,"Oh, that would be great!"
151,Rachel,"I love him, I love him, I love him..."
152,Ross,"Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!"
153,Rachel,So wh..?
154,Rachel,"He's smart, he's qualified."
155,Rachel,Give me one good    reason we shouldn't try him out.
156,Ross,"Because, it's weird!"
157,Rachel,Why?
158,Ross,What kind of job is that for a man?
159,Ross,A nanny?
160,Ross,I-It's    like if a woman wanted to be...
161,Rachel,Yes?
162,Ross,King?
163,Rachel,Please?
164,Rachel,YES!
165,Rachel,Sandy you're hired.
166,Rachel,Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.
167,Ross,You gotta be at least bi... COMMERCIAL BREAK
168,Chandler,Hey!
169,Chandler,I need you to set me up for a joke.
170,Chandler,"Later, when Monica    is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks."
171,Joey,Ooh.
172,Joey,I-I don't know Chan.
173,Joey,I'm not so good with remembering    lines.
174,Chandler,"Well, thank God your    livelihood doesn't depend on it."
175,Joey,"I know, right?"
176,Joey,Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?
177,Chandler,Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy    she's ever met.
178,Joey,Seriously?
179,Joey,She actually said that?
180,Chandler,Yes!
181,Chandler,Am I crazy to be this upset?
182,Joey,Nooooo!
183,Joey,Being funny is your thing!
184,Chandler,Yeah!
185,Joey,"Without that, you just got ""lame with women""."
186,Chandler,Ye....
187,Monica,Hi!
188,Monica,There you are.
189,Joey,Fire trucks!
190,Phoebe,Oof...
191,Phoebe,"Oh, wait, wait!"
192,Phoebe,"No, no, it's not that."
193,Phoebe,Uhm...
194,Phoebe,Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no?
195,Phoebe,"Well,    uhm..."
196,Phoebe,I am.
197,Phoebe,His ... his name is Mike.
198,Phoebe,"Yeah, I should have told you."
199,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
200,Phoebe,I am happy.
201,Phoebe,"Well... but David, just..."
202,Phoebe,I just want you to know    that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things    I've ever had to do.
203,Phoebe,"Of course, yeah."
204,Phoebe,"You know, a kiss    on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate..."
205,Phoebe,I mean...
206,Phoebe,Yeah?
207,Phoebe,"Well, if that's what they do in Minsk..."
208,Phoebe,In New York...    it's...
209,Rachel,Oh... Oh boy...  Hi...
210,Ross,Is everything allright?
211,Rachel,"Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine."
212,Rachel,Sandy was just... was    just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancée and it was just    sooo beautiful.
213,Rachel,I can't...
214,Rachel,I can't hear it again.
215,Ross,"And I'm fine never having heard it...  Rach, can I... can I see    you for a sec?"
216,Rachel,Yeah!
217,Rachel,Excuse me...
218,Ross,Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three    times...?
219,Ross,Huh?
220,Ross,I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.
221,Rachel,"Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive,    that's all."
222,Ross,"Okay, okay, see... that... that    is the problem."
223,Ross,He is too sensitive.
224,Rachel,What...?
225,Rachel,Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
226,Ross,"Yeah, I mean, all things    that guy..."
227,Ross,These are amazing!
228,Rachel,Sandy made Madeleines.
229,Ross,This... this is exactly what I'm talking about.
230,Ross,"What    kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh?"
231,Ross,"They're not even...    butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks."
232,Rachel,"Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say..."
233,Rachel,"I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men."
234,Rachel,"You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in    from branding cattle."
235,Ross,Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
236,Rachel,"Okay, what?"
237,Rachel,What is too sensitive?
238,Phoebe,"Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this."
239,Phoebe,It's bad.
240,Phoebe,"No, no."
241,Phoebe,No.
242,Phoebe,"Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah,    we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with    Mike and I really care about him..."
243,Phoebe,And you thanks for the    face massage.
244,Phoebe,Thank you.
245,Ross,Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?
246,Monica,Yeah!
247,Monica,I think that's great!
248,Ross,Oh really?
249,Ross,"Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites    poetry and bakes Madeleines?"
250,Monica,Oh... How are they?
251,Ross,Lighter than air...
252,Ross,But that's not the point.
253,Joey,Hey!
254,Ross,Hey...!
255,Ross,Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
256,Joey,Really...?
257,Joey,Guys do that...?
258,Joey,That's...    weird...
259,Ross,Thank you!
260,Joey,That's like a woman wanting to be a...
261,Ross,...a what?
262,Ross,A what?
263,Ross,What's the end of that sentence?
264,Monica,Yes... What is the end of that sentence?
265,Joey,Uhm... A penis model.
266,Joey,"Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler    that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?"
267,Monica,"Yeah, so?"
268,Ross,Wow!
269,Joey,Really?
270,Joey,Do you not know Chandler?
271,Monica,Is that why he's acting so weird...?
272,Monica,He's jealous...?
273,Monica,"Oh my God, that is crazy."
274,Monica,It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...
275,Joey,So what?
276,Joey,"Being funny is Chandler's thing...    You know, like Ross's thing is..."
277,Ross,Science...?
278,Ross,Academia...?
279,Ross,Being a good father...?
280,Joey,...No...
281,Monica,I can't believe he's that upset about this...
282,Joey,"Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay."
283,Joey,'Cause he's feeling like...
284,Chandler,Hey!
285,Joey,Heeeyy!
286,Joey,Hey!
287,Chandler,What are you guys talking about?
288,Ross,Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
289,Chandler,You got a man who's a nanny...?
290,Chandler,You got a manny...?
291,Chandler,"You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do    draw the line at a male wetnurse."
292,Monica,"Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!"
293,Chandler,"If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would    have brought more pizza."
294,Monica,"Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it!"
295,Chandler,What is so funny about that?
296,Monica,"Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say    it..."
297,Monica,"I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing."
298,Monica,You're a funny guy!
299,Chandler,Did you tell her what we talked about?
300,Joey,Yeah....
301,Chandler,So those were pity laughs?
302,Chandler,PITY LAUGHS?
303,Monica,"Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with    Geoffrey."
304,Chandler,Oh yeah?
305,Chandler,Is he funnier than me?
306,Monica,"Well, you're... you're different funny..."
307,Monica,"I mean,    you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions...    and... and limericks..."
308,Chandler,I do limericks... uhm...
309,Chandler,"There once was a man named    Chandler, whose wife made him die inside."
310,Monica,"Honey, you know I think you're hilarious!"
311,Monica,"Come on,    you know that joke you told me last week?"
312,Monica,The one about Jerry Lewis and the    girl with the lazy eye...?
313,Monica,That slayed me.
314,Ross,Hey...
315,Ross,I made up that joke and told it to you!
316,Joey,Not knowing when to shut up...
317,Ross,Yep!
318,Ross,That's my thing... COMMERCIAL BREAK
319,Phoebe,"No, no, no, no, no..."
320,Phoebe,It's not... it's not... i'ts    not as bad as it looks... really.
321,Phoebe,I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.
322,Phoebe,"No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years    ago, and he lives in Minsk."
323,Phoebe,He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days.
324,Phoebe,"No, no..."
325,Phoebe,"Oh, well, yeah..."
326,Phoebe,Stop it!
327,Phoebe,"Stop it, before someone gets really hurt!"
328,Phoebe,"Here David, you    should just go."
329,Phoebe,"Okay, well... guys?"
330,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry."
331,Phoebe,If you...
332,Phoebe,"If you want your    key back, I totally understand."
333,Phoebe,Right!
334,Phoebe,Never!
335,Phoebe,Never!
336,Phoebe,I swear!
337,Joey,Yeah!
338,Joey,Allright!
339,Joey,"Hey, hey Ross."
340,Joey,Check it out!
341,Joey,Sandy taught    me Hot-cross Buns.
342,Ross,Really?
343,Ross,Sounded like Three Blind Mice.
344,Joey,Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this...
345,Ross,I swear to    God...!
346,Joey,Me!
347,Joey,I'm up for puppets!
348,Ross,"Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed    to appreciate puppets?"
349,Joey,I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch.
350,Ross,Oh my God!
351,Rachel,That was kind of rude!
352,Ross,"Oh, I'm sorry."
353,Ross,Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps    for me.
354,Rachel,"You know, he was just doing his job..."
355,Ross,"Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one    who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there..."
356,Ross,But I just...
357,Ross,I can't...
358,Ross,I    can't go through with this.
359,Rachel,"Oh, come on Ross..."
360,Ross,No!
361,Ross,"Hey, you know what?"
362,Ross,I'm sorry.
363,Ross,I would never force    you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...
364,Rachel,Oh... That's true.
365,Ross,Thank you!
366,Rachel,"Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're    gonna have to do it."
367,Joey,I am learning so much from you.
368,Chandler,"Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend    has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com."
369,Monica,"Honey, you can relax."
370,Monica,"Last night at work, Geoffrey    told this really sexist joke."
371,Monica,"After that, not so funny anymore."
372,Chandler,Really...?
373,Chandler,See... that's the

375,Monica,You know I love you.
376,Chandler,I love you too.

379,Joey,Allright.
380,Joey,See you later!
381,Chandler,See ya!
382,Joey,Did that guy really make that joke?
383,Monica,Naaaa...
384,Monica,He still kills me.
385,Monica,"Last night he had me laughing    so hard, I swear... a little pee came out."
386,Ross,Here goes...
387,Rachel,I can't watch.
388,Rachel,It's like firing Elmo.
389,Ross,"Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk."
390,Ross,I'm afraid    it's not working out.
391,Ross,"Yeah, uhm..."
392,Ross,"I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great...    with Emma... uhm... We just feel..."
393,Rachel,YOU!
394,Rachel,You feel!
395,Ross,I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right.
396,Ross,I'm sorry.
397,Ross,We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...
398,Rachel,"Oh, damn you Geller!"
399,Ross,"Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings."
400,Ross,"No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's    uhm... my issue."
401,Ross,"You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with    a guy who's as sensitive as you."
402,Ross,Why...
403,Ross,I...
404,Ross,I don't know.
405,Ross,Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
406,Ross,"I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was    kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now."
407,Rachel,Huh ha ha!
408,Ross,I play squash...!
409,Ross,"Anyway, uhm..."
410,Ross,I uhm...
411,Ross,I always get    the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.
412,Ross,It was hard...
413,Ross,I remember...
414,Ross,"I was in my bedroom...    playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father    walks in and says... he says... ""What are you doing with those things?"
415,Ross,"What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like    a... like a real boy?"
416,Ross,I know I am!
417,Ross,"...And when it's    summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?"
418,Ross,Here come some more... COMMERCIAL BREAK
419,Joey,Wow!

1,Monica,That's also like the tenth time you told us.
2,Phoebe,"Yeah, oh I'm sorry, it must be really hard to hear!"
3,Phoebe,"I tell ya, it's a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder!"
4,Phoebe,I'm so sick of being pregnant!
5,Phoebe,"The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, causeOh!"
6,Phoebe,I'm pregnant!
7,Ross,"Pheebs, didyou want a cookie?"
8,Phoebe,Thank you so much.
9,Rachel,"So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?"

19,Ross,"So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?"
20,Joey,Whoa-whoa-whoa!
21,Joey,"Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don't you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?"
22,Chandler,"Oh, it's awkward."
23,Chandler,It's awkward.
24,Chandler,It's awkward.
25,Ross,I sort've already asked Chandler.
26,Joey,What?!
27,Joey,He got to do it at your first wedding!
28,Ross,"Joey, I figured you'd understand."
29,Ross,"I mean, I-I've known him a lot longer."
30,Joey,Come on Ross!
31,Joey,"Look, I-I don't have any brothers; I'll never get to be a best man!"
32,Chandler,You can be the best man when I get married.
33,Joey,I'll never get to be a best man!
34,Ross,"Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?"
35,Chandler,"Oh no-no-no, youyeah, of course you get to be my best man."
36,Joey,What about me?!
37,Joey,You-you just said I could!
38,Chandler,I'm not even getting married!
39,Chandler,"Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!"
40,Joey,I can't believe you're not picking me.
41,Ross,"Hey, how can it not be me?"
42,Ross,!HeyHey!
43,Chandler,I'm not even I'm not even

46,Joey,Yes!
47,Joey,Shame about you man.
48,Phoebe,Stop it!
49,Monica,What?
50,Phoebe,One of the babies is kicking.

106,Chandler,"Oh, I'm Ross."
107,Chandler,I'm Ross.
108,Chandler,I'm too good for the Hut; I'm too good for the Hut.
109,Ross,"Look, I gotta go pick up Ben."
110,Ross,"Everything so far sounds great Joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay?"

130,Rachel,Huh.
131,Rachel,"Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them."
132,Monica,Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
133,Rachel,Oh my God!
134,Rachel,We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
135,Monica,Wait a minute!
136,Monica,"Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant."
137,Monica,"Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila."
138,Rachel,"Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted!"
139,Monica,"Oh, she's gonna love that!"
140,Phoebe,What the hell is this?!
141,Phoebe,"What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can't use for another two months?!"
142,Phoebe,This sucks!
143,Phoebe,"All right, what's my next present?"

204,Chandler,Ugh.
205,Chandler,"Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for thisAh-ha-ha!!"
206,Chandler,You lost the ring!
207,Chandler,You're the worst best man ever!
208,Joey,"Dude, this isn't funny!"
209,Joey,What am I gonna do?!
210,Joey,"I go to bed last night, everything's cool!"
211,Joey,"I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone!"
212,Chandler,You slept with the stripper?
213,Joey,Of course!
214,Phoebe,"Hi, guys."
215,Rachel,Hi!
216,Rachel,Phoebe.
217,Monica,Hi Phoebe.
218,Phoebe,I-I wanted to apologise if Iy'know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower.
219,Phoebe,"Y'know it's just the hormones, y'know."
220,Rachel,No we
221,Monica,Hormones.
222,Rachel,"hormones, yeah."
223,Phoebe,"Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet."
224,Monica,"Wow, you seem to be doing so much better."
225,Monica,That's great.
226,Monica,So how-how are things going?
227,Phoebe,Good.
228,Phoebe,"Y'knowno-no, okay, it's-it feels like everything's been about me lately, so what's happening with you?"
229,Rachel,"Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding."
230,Phoebe,Oh!
231,Rachel,"It just might be too hard, given the history and all that"
232,Phoebe,Wow!
233,Phoebe,"This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him."
234,Rachel,"Well, h-how is this like that?"
235,Phoebe,"Well, let's see, it's not."
236,Phoebe,"Really, like that."
237,Phoebe,"Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y'know a bunch of y'know high school crap that nobody really gives y'know"
238,Rachel,"I'm-I'm sorry, I just thought that"
239,Phoebe,"Alrighty, here come the water works."
240,Joey,Ugh!
241,Joey,I don't know what I'm going to do!
242,Joey,I called the company that sent and th-they don't care!
243,Joey,"Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?"
244,Ross,Hey guys!
245,Chandler,Hey!
246,Joey,Hey
247,Ross,"I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!"
248,Ross,And the guys from work had a blast.
249,Ross,"Y'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before."
250,Ross,Yeah!
251,Ross,"And-and another one had never been to a party before, so"
252,Joey,"So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh?"
253,Joey,"Man, that's nice!"
254,Ross,"Yeah, right!"
255,Joey,"I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those"
256,Ross,That ring?
257,Ross,"When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her."
258,Chandler,"So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?"
259,Ross,Oh absolutely!
260,Ross,"It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life."
261,Chandler,"So you might say, it's a magic ring."
262,Joey,"Yeah, the stripper stole it."
263,Ross,My-my ring?
264,Ross,My-my wedding ring?
265,Ross,The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?!
266,Ross,H-how?!
267,Ross,How could this all happen?
268,Chandler,"Well, I think it all started when you said, ""Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man."""
269,Ross,"All right-all right, fine!"
270,Ross,I-I'm gonna call the cops!
271,Joey,"Dude, I screwed up, you don't have to turn me in!"
272,Ross,Not on you!
273,Ross,On the stripper!
274,Joey,"Oh, yeah, well I already did that!"
275,Joey,They said they're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.
276,Ross,"Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her!"
277,Joey,I did that too!
278,Joey,They wouldn't give me her real name or her number.
279,Joey,"They said, ""If I bothered them again they'd call the police."""
280,Joey,"I said, ""If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!"""
281,Ross,"So what, Joey?"
282,Ross,Wh-wh-what?
283,Ross,What are you telling me?
284,Ross,That there's nothing we can do?
285,Ross,"Well, how could this happen?"
286,Joey,"Look Ross, I am so-so sorry."
287,Joey,I-I-I
288,Chandler,"Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?"
289,Joey,"Oh, that sounds like fun, but we've got a ring to find!"
290,Monica,Here's your tea Phoebe.
291,Phoebe,It's so good.
292,Phoebe,"Oh, thanks."
293,Rachel,Good.
294,Monica,I'm so glad you liked it.
295,Phoebe,Oh!
296,Monica,What?
297,Rachel,What?!
298,Rachel,She made the tea!
299,Phoebe,Oh!
300,Phoebe,"No, I-I think I just had a contraction."
301,Rachel,You what?
302,Monica,Oh my God!
303,Phoebe,"Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one."
304,Monica,"Wait, you can't have the baby here!"
305,Monica,I mean I haven't sterilised it since the guys moved out!
306,Rachel,Okay.
307,Rachel,It's okay.
308,Rachel,We're gonna be okay.
309,Rachel,Y'know what?
310,Rachel,It's okay.
311,Rachel,"I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!"
312,Phoebe,No.
313,Phoebe,It's all right; it's probably false labour.
314,Phoebe,"They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book."
315,Monica,"Rachel, get the book!"
316,Monica,The book!
317,Rachel,Okay!
318,Rachel,Okay!
319,Rachel,Here!
320,Monica,The Bible?
321,Rachel,I don't know!
322,Joey,"All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk."
323,Joey,"And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won't recognise you because, well, why would she?"
324,Joey,"Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I."
325,Joey,"You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be uh, Mr. Wong."
326,Ross,Diverse.
327,Ross,The
328,Chandler,You be cool.
329,Chandler,The
330,Ross,Where's my ring?
331,Ross,My dead grandmother's wedding ring?
332,Ross,Where is it?
333,Ross,Where is it?
334,Chandler,"Way to be cool, man."
335,Chandler,The
336,Joey,"There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!"
337,Joey,The
338,Ross,We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
339,Ross,The
340,Chandler,Marry me.
341,Joey,I don't get it!
342,Joey,It was in my room all night!
343,Joey,"And if she didn't take it, and I didn't take it; and you  didn't take it, then who did?"
344,Joey,Shh!
345,Joey,We're trying to think!
346,Rachel,I still don't get how you know when it's false labour.
347,Phoebe,"Well, do you see any babies?"
348,Monica,How do you feel?
349,Phoebe,"Okay, I guess."
350,Phoebe,"I mean I don't know, it's just, I guess I know it's going to be over soon."
351,Rachel,"Well, isn't that a good thing?"
352,Rachel,You said you were sick of this.
353,Phoebe,I know.
354,Phoebe,"It's just y'know usually when you're, when you're done with the pregnant thing, y'know, then you get to do the mom thing."
355,Phoebe,"I'm gonna be y'know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila."
356,Monica,Some moms do that.
357,Phoebe,Okay that's even sadder.
358,Phoebe,"Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it's just that now that they're in me it's like, it's like I know them y'know, I mean-I mean, it's just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away."
359,Monica,"Aww, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything."
360,Monica,"You're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better."
361,Phoebe,"Yeah, okay."
362,Rachel,"No, really."
363,Rachel,"Really, Pheebs, you're not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they're bad, y'know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down."
364,Rachel,Y'know?
365,Monica,"I mean, you're the one they're gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex."
366,Rachel,And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
367,Phoebe,Cool Aunt Phoebe.
368,Phoebe,I am pretty cool!
369,Monica,Yeah.
370,Rachel,"And y'know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you."

389,Joey,So!
390,Joey,Things can go wrong!
391,Joey,You don't know!
392,Joey,What if he doesn't make it?
393,Chandler,"He will, Joe."
394,Joey,"Yeah, but what if he doesn't?"

0,Monica,Hey guys!
1,Rachel,Hi!
2,Phoebe,Hey!
3,Monica,We need to talk to you about something.
4,Chandler,Yeah.
5,Chandler,We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
6,Phoebe,Hey!
7,Ross,Are you kidding?
8,Chandler,"Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy."
9,Chandler,"Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us."
10,Ross,That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!
11,Chandler,"No, no!"
12,Chandler,We made this decision together.
13,Ross,She's putting words in your mouth!
14,Joey,"Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!"
15,Rachel,I can't believe this!
16,Rachel,This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!
17,Monica,"No, it's not!"
18,Rachel,It's not?
19,Rachel,When was she born?
20,Phoebe,"Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break."
21,Monica,"Thank you, Pheebs!"
22,Phoebe,Sure.
23,Phoebe,It's just as well...
24,Phoebe,"I mean, last year wasn't very good."
25,Phoebe,I think she's losing her touch.
26,Monica,What?
27,Monica,"You are way off, lady!"
28,Phoebe,Am I?
29,Phoebe,Really?
30,Phoebe,Am I?
31,Phoebe,"Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong!"
32,Phoebe,"Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year."
33,Phoebe,You'd be in competition... with yourself.
34,Monica,That's my favourite kind!
35,Monica,"Okay, we are doing this!"
36,Chandler,Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
37,Monica,"Hey, stay out of this, Chandler!"
38,Monica,This is between me... and ME!
39,Chandler,We are supposed to make these decisions together!
40,Chandler,Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?
41,Chandler,OPENING CREDITS
42,Phoebe,Hey!
43,Rachel,Hi!
44,Rachel,Happy Thanksgiving!
45,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day."
46,Monica,"You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker."
47,Monica,Could you pick them up for me?
48,Phoebe,You're not making the pies yourself?
49,Monica,"No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies."
50,Monica,When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest.
51,Monica,I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.
52,Rachel,Did you at least win the contest?
53,Monica,"2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin!"
54,Monica,"Okay, I see you guys at 4."
55,Rachel,Can't wait!
56,Monica,This dinner is gonna be so great!
57,Monica,"In your face, last year ""me""!"
58,Phoebe,Hey Rach.
59,Rachel,Yeah.
60,Phoebe,What's Emma doing today?
61,Rachel,"Well, let's see... uh..."
62,Rachel,I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop.
63,Rachel,Why?
64,Phoebe,"Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant."
65,Rachel,Oh my God!
66,Rachel,That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!
67,Phoebe,"Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!"
68,Rachel,Oh!
69,Rachel,"Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!"
70,Phoebe,Oh... okay.
71,Rachel,"Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy..."
72,Rachel,And a thousand dollars.
73,Rachel,...is something I'm very interested in!
74,Rachel,"Oh please, do not tell Ross."
75,Rachel,He still believes that  what's in the inside is important...
76,Phoebe,"Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition."
77,Rachel,Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
78,Phoebe,"Well, I was thinking..."
79,Rachel,"Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid."
80,Phoebe,Yeah!
81,Monica,Did someone drop the baton again?
82,Chandler,Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?
83,Monica,I don't get older.
84,Monica,I just get better!
85,Chandler,You know what just occurred to me?
86,Chandler,This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us.
87,Chandler,"I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!"
88,Monica,You don't know that.
89,Chandler,Somebody is gonna pick us.
90,Monica,"Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!"
91,Chandler,I'm telling ya!
92,Chandler,It's gonna happen.
93,Chandler,"Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing."
94,Chandler,"What, he's my favourite author!"
95,Monica,Name one of his books.
96,Chandler,"""The Firm""?"
97,Monica,"Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready..."
98,Chandler,"You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself."
99,Chandler,Let me help this year.
100,Monica,"Oh, Chandler, that's sweet."
101,Monica,But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.
102,Chandler,"I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing ""high profile""."
103,Monica,"Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it."
104,Chandler,Tell me more.
105,Monica,"Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall."
106,Monica,You start by washing these  Not with soap!
107,Chandler,You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
108,Ross,Hey!
109,Ross,"Hey, guess what Joey has!"
110,Joey,Three tickets to today's Rangers game!
111,Ross,"Dude, I wanted him to guess."
112,Joey,Oh.
113,Chandler,Oh my God!
114,Joey,"Yeah, they're great seats too!"
115,Ross,Guess where they are?
116,Joey,Center ice.
117,Ross,Did I do something to you?
118,Chandler,"Hmm, the game's at one."
119,Ross,So?
120,Chandler,"Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back."
121,Joey,"So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time."
122,Chandler,"You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home."
123,Chandler,Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.
124,Joey,"Dude, two times that happened!"
125,Chandler,"Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!"
126,Ross,"He's right, man."
127,Joey,"Right, I guess."
128,Joey,"Alright, so see you at four."
129,Chandler,Okay.
130,Chandler,And get ready to taste my very special cranberries.
131,Chandler,Or should I say... chanberries!
132,Joey,"That's some gentle comedy, dude."
133,Ross,"We're still going at the game, right?"
134,Joey,Yeah!
135,Ross,Yeah.
136,Phoebe,Hey.
137,Rachel,"Oh Phoebe, listen."
138,Rachel,"Well, I think we gotta go."
139,Rachel,This place is really freaking me out.
140,Rachel,"I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid!"
141,Phoebe,We can't leave now!
142,Phoebe,"There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home!"
143,Phoebe,"This competition just blew wide open, folks!"
144,Rachel,"Phoebe, I think..."
145,Rachel,"It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!"
146,Phoebe,"Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared."
147,Phoebe,It's okay.
148,Phoebe,"Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron."
149,Phoebe,"Oh my God, they just took her sweater off."
150,Phoebe,Look at those arms!
151,Phoebe,Hello Michelin Man.
152,Rachel,"Oh, Phoebe!"
153,Rachel,Come on!
154,Rachel,"You know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet."
155,Rachel,"We gotta go, we got dinner!"
156,Phoebe,"But Emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way!"
157,Rachel,"Phoebe, you have to calm down."
158,Phoebe,Okay.
159,Phoebe,"Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now!"
160,Phoebe,I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!
161,Rachel,Really?
162,Phoebe,Yeah!
163,Rachel,You heard them say that?
164,Phoebe,Yeah!
165,Rachel,"All right, okay."
166,Rachel,"Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!"
167,Phoebe,Good!
168,Phoebe,Oh yay!
169,Phoebe,Let's get down to business!
170,Phoebe,Emma needs some makeup!
171,Rachel,"No, what?"
172,Phoebe,"Well, she's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!"
173,Rachel,"No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!"
174,Phoebe,Why not!
175,Rachel,Because I already did!
176,Joey,"Oh, Bob, get off the guy!"
177,Ross,Oh!
178,Ross,"What a game, huh?"
179,Joey,"I know, yeah."
180,Ross,I can't believe Chandler is missing this!
181,Joey,Yeah.
182,Joey,"I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say,  I am really enjoying Nacho Chair."
183,Ross,"Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away."
184,Joey,Ohhhh!
185,Joey,These seats are great!
186,Ross,"I know, I know!"
187,Ross,When I was here for Holidays on Ice  I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!
188,Joey,"Wow, hey, we'd better get going."
189,Joey,"If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner."
190,Ross,"Oh, but it's a kind game!"
191,Ross,"So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal."
192,Joey,I don't know...
193,Ross,One more fight!
194,Joey,Okay.
195,Ross,Okay.
196,Monica,Where is everybody?
197,Monica,They're forty-five minutes late!
198,Chandler,I can't believe they are not here!
199,Chandler,I slave and I slave for what?
200,Chandler,They've ruined cranberry day!
201,Joey,How late are we?
202,Ross,Forty-five minutes.
203,Joey,Wow
204,Ross,Here!
205,Joey,Okay.
206,Joey,"Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay?"
207,Joey,So they probably started without us.
208,Joey,We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were!
209,Ross,You may want to lose the foam finger!
210,Joey,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
211,Joey,You just want to put it on your hand!
212,Ross,Hey!
213,Phoebe,Oh!
214,Joey,You are not at Thanksgiving?
215,Rachel,No...
216,Phoebe,"No, we're late!"
217,Rachel,What are you doing here!
218,Ross,We're late too!
219,Joey,We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time
220,Phoebe,"Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!"
221,Ross,"So, nobody's here?"
222,Ross,Monica's gonna kill us!
223,Joey,"Yeah, where were you!"
224,Ross,"Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!"
225,Phoebe,"Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee!"
226,Rachel,And I won!
227,Ross,You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.
228,Rachel,Yes!
229,Rachel,Y-E-S.
230,Rachel,Yes!
231,Ross,"Let me see this...  Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division."
232,Rachel,Yeah.
233,Rachel,That's me!
234,Ross,You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?
235,Phoebe,And it looks like she put makeup on her!
236,Joey,"Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before..."
237,Ross,"I can't believe this, she's our daughter!"
238,Ross,That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!
239,Rachel,She won a thousand dollars!
240,Ross,So this is an annual thing?
241,Joey,Oh!
242,Joey,That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!
243,Phoebe,"You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!"
244,Ross,Yeah.
245,Ross,What are we gonna do?
246,Rachel,"Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap."
247,Joey,All right.
248,Joey,"Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae."
249,Phoebe,"Alright, what are we gonna say?"
250,Ross,"Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged!"
251,Ross,You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!
252,Phoebe,"Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!"
253,Joey,No.
254,Joey,Here
255,Ross,HEY!
256,Monica,Do you hear something?
257,Chandler,They're out there!
258,Monica,Ohhh!
259,Monica,Let me see!
260,Monica,"Oh God, I can't believe this!"
261,Monica,"They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!"
262,Chandler,Everything is so distorted!
263,Chandler,Looks like Joey has a giant hand!
264,Chandler,"Which says ""Rangers"" on it."
265,Chandler,They went to the game!
266,Monica,Oooh!
267,Monica,They are in for a world of pain!
268,Chandler,Ross' shirt is torn.
269,Monica,Oh!
270,Monica,They're late and they're sloppy!
271,Monica,(Rachel comes out of her apartment}
272,Rachel,"Alright, Emma is napping...  what happened to your shirt?"
273,Ross,I got mugged.
274,Ross,And they stole my pocket.
275,Phoebe,We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse.
276,Phoebe,Hey!
277,Phoebe,Ooh!
278,Phoebe,How about
279,Ross,That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
280,Rachel,"You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock."
281,Rachel,We'll just act casual.
282,Rachel,"We're not late, we're right on time."
283,Ross,We know you're out there.
284,Joey,Who do you think its from?
285,Rachel,"Oh, God."
286,Rachel,This is bad.
287,Rachel,This is so bad.
288,Ross,"Well, let's just go in there and face them."
289,Phoebe,"Well, I'm not going in first."
290,Phoebe,I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.
291,Joey,"I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning."
292,Rachel,"Oh, hey, I have an idea."
293,Rachel,"Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first."
294,Rachel,Ready?
295,Joey,Ah-haah!
296,Joey,I win!
297,Ross,What is that?
298,Joey,That's fire.
299,Joey,Beats everything.
300,Phoebe,"Oh, really?"
301,Phoebe,Does it beat water balloon?
302,Joey,Ooh!
303,Joey,"Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played."
304,Rachel,"Alright, enough, enough, come on."
305,Rachel,Let's just all go in at the same time.
306,Phoebe,It's locked.
307,Ross,Wha...?
308,Ross,"Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its"
309,Rachel,"Alright, come on...  Alright, you guys."
310,Rachel,We're so sorry we're late.
311,Rachel,"Please let us in, so we can have dinner together."
312,Monica,No!
313,Monica,Everything's cold.
314,Monica,The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.
315,Chandler,"Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that...  what happens to cranberry sauce?"
316,Monica,Nothing.
317,Monica,It's fine.
318,Chandler,Oh thank God!
319,Ross,"Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...?"
320,Ross,Our subway broke down.
321,Chandler,"That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand."
322,Ross,FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!
323,Rachel,"You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late."
324,Rachel,"We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey."
325,Joey,I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that.
326,Monica,That's all the turkey you're gonna get.
327,Ross,How are we gonna decide who gets this?
328,Joey,WATER BALLOON!
329,Phoebe,What are we gonna do?
330,Phoebe,I'm starving.
331,Rachel,"Oh, I just remembered."
332,Rachel,We do have something to eat.
333,Rachel,Monica put something in our oven this morning.
334,Phoebe,Oh yeah!
335,Monica,"Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry."
336,Chandler,"Guys, I'd listen to her."
337,Chandler,The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it.
338,Rachel,Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS.
339,Ross,That's worse than no food.
340,Chandler,HA-HA!
341,Chandler,All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!
342,Monica,Stinky?
343,Chandler,Please let me stay on this side of the door.
344,Rachel,"Oh, I know..."
345,Rachel,I still have my old key!
346,Rachel,We can just unlock the door.
347,Phoebe,"Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea."
348,Phoebe,They clearly don't want to be with us.
349,Rachel,You know what?
350,Rachel,"I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together."
351,Joey,"Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know?"
352,Joey,Look them in the eye.
353,Joey,I know I can get them to forgive us.
354,Ross,I don't know...
355,Joey,I'm telling ya...
356,Joey,I can do it.
357,Ross,"Yeah, he can do it!"
358,Rachel,Oh!
359,Joey,Oh!
360,Joey,It all looks so
361,Chandler,The cranberries...?
362,Monica,Oh!
363,Monica,Enough!
364,Monica,A monkey could have made 'em!
365,Joey,"Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible."
366,Chandler,He's doing that weird eye contact thing.
367,Chandler,"Don't look at him, don't look at him!"
368,Joey,"Come on you guys, we want you to know we're  very very sorry."
369,Joey,Right guys?
370,Ross,I feel terrible.
371,Ross,Phoebe and
372,Rachel,"So, so sorry."
373,Joey,Now let's not ruin this day.
374,Joey,You worked so hard.
375,Joey,"Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?"
376,Chandler,The floating heads do make a good point.
377,Monica,"Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad."
378,Rachel,So bad.
379,Rachel,Ross
380,Phoebe,So bad.
381,Monica,"Okay, okay."
382,Monica,You two  go get the dessert.
383,Monica,And I'll let you in.
384,Rachel,Dessert?
385,Monica,"Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies."
386,Monica,"You did remember, right?"
387,Phoebe,"Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize ."
388,Phoebe,Here!
389,Monica,Grand Supreme Little Darling?
390,Rachel,Congratulatioooons!
391,Monica,Oh my God!
392,Monica,YOU FORGOT THE PIES?
393,Monica,"Well, I cannot believe this."
394,Monica,"You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do."
395,Ross,"Really girls, not cool."
396,Chandler,"Well, you manheads aren't any better."
397,Chandler,You lied about going to the game.
398,Chandler,"You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway."
399,Joey,Hey!
400,Joey,I'm getting a little tired of this okay?
401,Joey,We said we're sorry.
402,Joey,It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes!
403,Joey,A day of forgiveness!
404,Ross,It's a day to be thankful.
405,Joey,Don't make me come up there!
406,Monica,It's too late for apologies.
407,Joey,Fine!
408,Joey,Let's just go.
409,Joey,I don't need your stupid dinner.
410,Chandler,That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
411,Rachel,"Ewww, is that what that is?"
412,Joey,Sorry!
413,Phoebe,"Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving."
414,Rachel,Yeah!
415,Rachel,I'll cook!
416,Ross,Yeah!
417,Ross,Let's go out.
418,Rachel,Hey!
419,Joey,Yeah!
420,Joey,You three have a nice Thanksgiving.
421,Monica,The three of us?
422,Joey,Yeah!
423,Joey,"You, Chan, and the vein!"
424,Joey,Ha!
425,Joey,Oh-oh!
426,Joey,I'm stuck!
427,Monica,"Joey, that is not gonna work."
428,Joey,No seriously...
429,Joey,I'm really wedged in here.
430,Phoebe,I'll pull you through.
431,Ross,Okay.
432,Joey,aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP!
433,Joey,STOP!
434,Joey,I'm worried about damaging my head.
435,Chandler,A little late for that.
436,Joey,"Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something."
437,Monica,"Alright, well, this does not change anything."
438,Monica,"Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face."
439,Chandler,"Uhm, we've got turkey grease."
440,Monica,Bring it.
441,Joey,I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...
442,Monica,Here you go!
443,Joey,"Oh, that smells good!"
444,Joey,Okay.
445,Monica,"Okay, try it."
446,Joey,It isn't working.
447,Monica,"Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain."
448,Joey,"Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!"
449,Chandler,Can you ever feel your ears?
450,Joey,Interesting...
451,Monica,"Chandler, where are your tools?"
452,Chandler,"Oh, I left them on my bulldozer..."
453,Chandler,I don't have tools!
454,Monica,"I do, but Rachel borrowed them."
455,Rachel,I lent them to Ross.
456,Ross,I gave them to Joey.
457,Joey,I left them at the park.
458,Monica,Oh!
459,Ross,I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.
460,Phoebe,I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.
461,Ross,Nice!
462,Monica,"Okay, I have to get that."
463,Monica,"Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone."
464,Monica,Thanksgiving is over.
465,Monica,The Vein has spoken.
466,Joey,It's really starting to hurt.

44,Joey,So close.
45,Ross,Hey everybody!
46,Ross,"Hey uh, this is Elizabeth."
47,Chandler,Isn't she cute?
48,Chandler,No!
49,Phoebe,"Y'know, this is probably none of my business, but weren't you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?"
50,Ross,"Oh no-no-no, we're just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house."
51,Phoebe,"Oh, sly."
52,Ross,Bye.
53,Ross,Oh that is quite all right ma'am.
54,Chandler,"So, why is she leaving?"
55,Chandler,Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
56,Ross,"Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow."

69,Monica,"Y'know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs."
70,Joey,"Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break."
71,Joey,"Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?"
72,Ross,"Well, actually it's been great."
73,Ross,"She's 20 so she's not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now."
74,Monica,Well that is great.
75,Monica,"And seriously, she seems very nice."
76,Ross,Thanks.
77,Ross,"I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her."

87,Phoebe,"Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing."
88,Chandler,Oh that's so funny because we found someone too.
89,Phoebe,"Oh that's good, I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo."
90,Chandler,Why would our guy be a weirdo?
91,Phoebe,Cause that's just your taste.
92,Monica,Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.
93,Phoebe,Oh yeah?
94,Monica,Yeah!
95,Phoebe,My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work.
96,Phoebe,"And, he has one of these"
97,Chandler,A face ass?
98,Phoebe,A chin dimple!
99,Monica,"Well, uh y'know, our guy works with Chandler and he's really nice and smart and he's a great dresser!"
100,Phoebe,Have you seen your guy's body?
101,Chandler,"No, our guy is just a floating head."
102,Phoebe,Well my guy is spectacular.
103,Phoebe,Okay?
104,Phoebe,"He's a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it."
105,Phoebe,And I mean all of it.
106,Monica,You're not supposed to look!
107,Phoebe,"Oh yeah, like there are police for that!"
108,Chandler,Wait!
109,Chandler,You look?
110,Chandler,You-you massaged me.
111,Phoebe,I know.

121,Joey,Huh.
122,Chandler,"Well, youdon't look good Joe."
123,Joey,The fridge broke.
124,Joey,I have to eat everything.
125,Joey,"Cold cuts, ice cream, limesHey, what was in that brown jar?"
126,Chandler,That's still in there?
127,Joey,Not anymore.
128,Joey,"So anyway, how do you want to pay me?"
129,Chandler,Is this a service you're providing me?
130,Joey,No!
131,Joey,No!
132,Joey,No!
133,Joey,For my new fridgeour new fridge!
134,Chandler,Our new fridge?
135,Chandler,I don't live here anymore.
136,Joey,So what?
137,Joey,"Look, suppose we were a divorced couple."
138,Chandler,Uh-huh.
139,Joey,"And I got custody of the kid, right?"
140,Joey,Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.
141,Chandler,Okay
142,Joey,Give me $400!

155,Ross,"So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints."
156,Ross,You don't understand!
157,Ross,Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her!
158,Ross,Is that taking it slow?!
159,Ross,"No, I'm not ready for this!"
160,Ross,Okay?
161,Ross,What-what do I tell her?
162,Chandler,Just tell her the truth!
163,Chandler,Tell her you're not ready.
164,Ross,I can do that.
165,Ross,"Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?"
166,Chandler,Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
167,Joey,Or!
168,Joey,"You can just, y'know"
169,Ross,What the hell are you doing?
170,Joey,What?
171,Joey,What the hell am I doing?
172,Joey,You just broke my fridge!
173,Ross,What?!
174,Ross,What?
175,Ross,"How do you, how do you even know its broken?"
176,Joey,"Oh-ho-ho, you think I don't know what breaks my fridge?"
177,Joey,Excuse me!
178,Joey,Well what do you know!
179,Joey,Broken!
180,Joey,That'll be $400!
181,Chandler,"Joey, I saw you push him!"
182,Joey,You pushed him!
183,Ross,"Joey, I did not break this!"
184,Ross,Okay?
185,Ross,That has been broken for a while.
186,Joey,All right.
187,Joey,"Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?"
188,Chandler,Uh-huh.
189,Joey,I still haven't gotten a check for your half yet.
190,Ross,Do not give him any money!
191,Joey,I'm not talking to you!
192,Joey,You broke my fridge!
193,Ross,Yes.
194,Ross,Yes!
195,Ross,"Please, come in."
196,Ross,Oo-oo!
197,Ross,"Yeah, it kinda grows on you."
198,Ross,"Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation."
199,Ross,"Look, I  Look, I'm having a great time with you and I just don't want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us."
200,Ross,"So, I'm sorry I just don't think we should go away together yet."
201,Ross,It's-it's too soon.
202,Ross,No.
203,Ross,I think you misunderstood what I was saying.
204,Ross,What I meant was

207,Ross,Hey!
208,Chandler,Hey!
209,Phoebe,Hey!

211,Monica,How did it go with Elizabeth?
212,Ross,Huh?
213,Ross,"Oh-oh, it was fine."
214,Ross,"Uh, it was just a misunderstanding."
215,Ross,She didn't want me to go with her.
216,Ross,She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.
217,Chandler,"Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?"
218,Ross,What's-what's the difference?
219,Monica,"Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents."
220,Monica,Spring break you're doing frat guys.
221,Ross,"Hey, y'know what?"
222,Ross,Not all spring breaks are like that.
223,Phoebe,What did you do on yours?
224,Ross,I went to Egypt with my dad.
225,Chandler,"I can see it now, ""Look dad, it's the Sphinx!"""
226,Ross,"Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, ""Spring break!"""
227,Ross,All right?
228,Ross,I mean she's taken my class!
229,Monica,And slept with the professor.
230,Ross,I'm gonna call her.
231,Chandler,Yeah.
232,Rachel,Hey!
233,Rachel,"You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian."
234,Rachel,"We just uh, we just met at the newsstand."
235,Rachel,We both grabbed for the last Field & Stream.
236,Rachel,What?
237,Rachel,I read that.
238,Rachel,Oh yes!
239,Rachel,Thank you!
240,Phoebe,"Rachel, what the hell is this?"
241,Rachel,What?
242,Phoebe,You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!
243,Rachel,You found me a guy?
244,Monica,Yes!
245,Monica,We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler's work!
246,Phoebe,Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
247,Rachel,"Well, y'know what though you guys?"
248,Rachel,I really appreciate that but I think I'm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
249,Chandler,Are you sure?!
250,Chandler,Because our guy smells incredible!
251,Monica,"Uh, would you stop it with that already?"
252,Rachel,"Oh, thank you."
253,Phoebe,"So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?"
254,Phoebe,"No reason, it's just I know a single guy that cares about other people."
255,Chandler,Are you funny?
256,Rachel,What are you guys doing?
257,Monica,Are you funny?
258,Monica,Tell us a joke!
259,Phoebe,"Well, so do a lot of people."
260,Rachel,"Oh, but y'know, no, you didn't give me your phone number."
261,Chandler,Turns out he is kinda funny.
262,Chandler,Commercial Break
263,Rachel,I cannot believe you guys!
264,Rachel,He was really nice and he left because of you!
265,Chandler,"Yeah, but Sebastian?"
266,Chandler,What is that?
267,Chandler,A cat's name?
268,Phoebe,"Yeah, y'know what I noticed Rachel?"
269,Phoebe,He scares easy.
270,Phoebe,Is that the kind of guy you'd like to take to a ball?
271,Phoebe,"""Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?"""
272,Phoebe,"""Uhh, okayI gotta go!"""
273,Monica,All right guys stop it.
274,Monica,"Rachel, we're very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do."
275,Monica,And y'know what?
276,Monica,"Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you."
277,Phoebe,Yeah!
278,Phoebe,What have you got to lose?
279,Phoebe,Y'know you might even end up with someone really special  if you pick my guy.
280,Rachel,All right.
281,Chandler,"Okay, so you will meet our guys?"
282,Rachel,"Yes, I'll meet em."
283,Chandler,"Okay now it doesn't matter which one you choose, y'know?"
284,Chandler,It's completely up to you.
285,Chandler,"Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself."
286,Joey,Pheebs!
287,Joey,There you are!
288,Joey,"Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!"
289,Phoebe,Okay sure!
290,Joey,Really?
291,Phoebe,"Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions."
292,Joey,Call it even?
293,Phoebe,Okay.
294,Chandler,"Well, there you are!"
295,Chandler,So what did Elizabeth say?
296,Ross,"Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo."
297,Ross,"That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl's bodies, waking up next to people you don't even know"
298,Joey,"Man, she is going to have a great time!"
299,Joey,Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
300,Chandler,You know the hotels?
301,Joey,Sure!
302,Joey,I was there!
303,Joey,Spring Break '81!
304,Joey,Woo-hoo!

306,Joey,So what?
307,Joey,"I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast."
308,Joey,And y'know who knows how to party?
309,Joey,Drunk college chicks.
310,Ross,"Okay, she can't go."
311,Phoebe,"Ross, you can't tell her not to go."
312,Phoebe,You just started dating.
313,Ross,Then what am I supposed to do?
314,Phoebe,"Nothing, you just have to be cool with it."
315,Ross,"Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?"
316,Chandler,"Well, maybe you don't marry this one."
317,Ross,I'm so glad you're going on this trip!
318,Ross,Sure.
319,Ross,Sure.
320,Ross,"Look I don't, I don't know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam."
321,Ross,Are you into crafts at all?
322,Ross,"Well, yeah, of-of course I'm okay!"
323,Ross,What?
324,Ross,I'm just being supportive.
325,Ross,"Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and  what-what is uh, what's this?"

402,Phoebe,"Yeah, okay, let's talk it out."
403,Rachel,I Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
404,Rachel,I'll tell ya who should be embarrassed!
405,Rachel,It's you guys!
406,Rachel,Come on!
407,Rachel,This is ridiculous!
408,Rachel,"Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!"
409,Phoebe,Then why did she ask us to
410,Rachel,I am still talking!!
411,Rachel,And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked!
412,Rachel,"I mean, no offense to you guys."
413,Rachel,Really!
414,Rachel,"I mean  congratulations on all the cash,  and-and y'knowWow!"
415,Rachel,You do have very soft hair!
416,Rachel,But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this!
417,Rachel,Good-bye!
418,Rachel,Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?
419,Rachel,Thank you!
420,Ross,"So uh, have a great time down there."
421,Ross,Yeah.
422,Ross,"And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?"
423,Ross,"It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh?"
424,Ross,"Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it's revealing which I'm fine with, no I'm concerned about your health, sun exposure."
425,Ross,"Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30."
426,Ross,"I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's-it's get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it's just milk."
427,Ross,Really?
428,Ross,Okay.
429,Ross,Cool.
430,Ross,Call me!
431,Ross,Ending Credits

436,Chandler,So what was it for anyway?
437,Rachel,I wanna say a disease.

442,Rachel,All right.
443,Phoebe,"Oh my God, look!"
444,Phoebe,That's Elizabeth!
445,Rachel,Oh-oh Professor Geller.
446,Joey,"Ahh, to be 13 again."
447,Chandler,Yeah.
448,Chandler,End
0,Ross,Hey!
1,Ross,What are you guys looking at?
2,Joey,"Oh, it's a poster for that World War I movie that I'm in, check it out."
3,Ross,Yeah?
4,Ross,Wow!
5,Ross,It looks really violent!
6,Joey,Uh-huh!
7,Joey,I know.
8,Joey,I'm coming soon to a theater near you!
9,Joey,I'm in THX!
10,Joey,I'm unsuitable for children!
11,Ross,Now I cannot wait to see this.
12,Joey,"Yeah, yeah, it's already generating Oscar buzz."
13,Phoebe,I started that!
14,Joey,I thought I did!
15,Joey,Oh hey guess what?
16,Joey,The premiere is next week and you're all invited!
17,Monica,Are we gonna take a limo?
18,Joey,Sure!
19,Joey,Why not?
20,Monica,Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!
21,Rachel,"Well obviously I won't be able to come, for those of you who haven't checked their calendars today is my due date."
22,Rachel,"Well y'know, I just want to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you've been during this time."
23,Rachel,I really couldn't have done it without you.
24,Rachel,And I have loved these last nine months!
25,Rachel,"And even though I am so looking forward to the next part, I am really gonna miss being pregnant."
26,Rachel,"That's right, still no baby!"
27,Rachel,Come on people!
28,Rachel,Please make some room!
29,Ross,"Uh sweetie, maybe you'd be more comfortable here?"
30,Rachel,You.
31,Rachel,Like you haven't done enough.
32,Ross,"Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do."
33,Ross,I mean I wish I were a seahorse.
34,Ross,"Because with seahorses it's the male, they carry the babies."
35,Ross,"And then also umm, I'd be far away in the sea."
36,Rachel,God.
37,Rachel,I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
38,Phoebe,"Oh I know, I've been there."
39,Phoebe,I remember toward the end
40,Rachel,"Oh Phoebe, that's a great story."
41,Rachel,Can you tell it to me when you're getting me some iced tea?
42,Rachel,"Oh God, get out!"
43,Rachel,Get out!!
44,Rachel,Get out!!
45,Rachel,Get out!
46,Chandler,Let's.
47,Chandler,Opening Credits
48,Chandler,Hey!
49,Chandler,Did you have the baby yet?
50,Rachel,Do you want me to come over there and sit on you?
51,Rachel,Cause I'll do it.
52,Monica,What are you doing here so early?
53,Rachel,They sent me home from work.
54,Rachel,"They were like, ""Start your maternity leave now!"
55,Rachel,"Just rest, get ready for the baby."""
56,Rachel,Well y'know what?
57,Rachel,Screw em!
58,Rachel,"If they don't want me there, I'll just hang out with you guys."
59,Phoebe,Or you can do volunteer work.
60,Joey,Hello?
61,Joey,One guest?
62,Joey,You told me I can have six tickets!
63,Joey,Oh my God.
64,Joey,So that's it?!
65,Joey,I only get to bring one guest?
66,Joey,Did you hear that?
67,Joey,I only get one extra ticket to my premiere.
68,Joey,So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.
69,Rachel,What-what about me?
70,Joey,You said you didn't want to go.
71,Rachel,I don't.
72,Rachel,But I would still like to be acknowledged.
73,Rachel,What?
74,Rachel,Just because I'm pregnant you think I'm invisible.
75,Joey,Definitely not invisible.
76,Monica,"Well, well Ross didn't care enough to be here, so I think he's out."
77,Monica,You snooze you lose.
78,Chandler,"He's not snoozing, he's teaching a class."
79,Monica,Well then somebody's snoozing.
80,Monica,"Joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here."
81,Chandler,I haven't seen this dress.
82,Monica,Star in a movie.
83,Phoebe,"Joey, you pick who ever you want."
84,Phoebe,Okay?
85,Phoebe,You just listen to your heart.
86,Phoebe,What does it tell you?
87,Phoebe,"Phoebe, Phoebe."
88,Joey,Well uhI think I want to take Chandler.
89,Phoebe,Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-PhoebeBurrrrr!
90,Chandler,You really want to take me?
91,Joey,Yeah!
92,Joey,Yeah!
93,Joey,"I mean I'm sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but y'know Chandler always supported my career."
94,Joey,He's paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.
95,Chandler,So you're never actually going to pay me back?
96,Monica,"Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you're gonna take him?"
97,Monica,"Joey, I don't think you're comprehending just how slutty this dress is!"
98,Joey,"It's not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it's-it's everything."
99,Joey,Y'know?
100,Joey,He read lines with me.
101,Joey,"He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn't get parts that I really wanted."
102,Joey,You always believed in me man.
103,Joey,"Even, even when I didn't believe in myself."
104,Chandler,I always knew you were gonna make it.
105,Chandler,I'm so proud of you.
106,Joey,Thanks.
107,Joey,That means a lot to me.
108,Phoebe,"Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress."
109,Joey,I'm gonna go shave.
110,Chandler,"Yeah well, I'm gonna go spit."
111,Rachel,"Oh, I have to pee."
112,Rachel,If I don't come out in five minutes it's because I've choked to death on the potpourri stink.
113,Phoebe,"When she comes out, you hold her nose, I'll blow in her mouth, and the kid will just  right out of her."
114,Monica,She's over a week late!
115,Monica,"She gotta have it today, right?"
116,Phoebe,I don't know.
117,Phoebe,I-I think it's still gonna be a while.
118,Monica,"Hmm, care to make it interesting?"
119,Monica,I'll bet you that she'll have it by this time tomorrow.
120,Phoebe,You're on!
121,Monica,"Okay, how much?"
122,Phoebe,One hundred thousand dollars!
123,Monica,How about fifty bucks?
124,Phoebe,Fine!
125,Phoebe,I'll call Zurich and move some money around.
126,Rachel,"All right, who's turn is it to help me get up!"
127,Phoebe,No one's here!
128,Phoebe,Oh damnit!
129,Chandler,This is so exciting!
130,Chandler,It's so glamorous!
131,Chandler,People taking our picture.
132,Chandler,How do I look?
133,Joey,A little tall.
134,Chandler,What?
135,Joey,"Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller?"
136,Joey,There you go.
137,Chandler,It's just so glamorous.
138,Phoebe,Oh hey Mon?
139,Phoebe,Rach is here!
140,Phoebe,"Ohh, you're still pregnant."
141,Phoebe,"Oh, I'm sorry."
142,Phoebe,I know how uncomfortable you are.
143,Phoebe,Y'know what?
144,Phoebe,You look great.
145,Phoebe,"Yeah, like fifty bucks."
146,Rachel,"Oh, I have to go pee."
147,Rachel,Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy.
148,Monica,Damnit!
149,Monica,Damnit!!
150,Monica,Here's your fifty bucks!
151,Phoebe,It's interesting that you lost.
152,Phoebe,"Now, I forget, do you like to lose?"
153,Monica,Now stop it!
154,Monica,Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!
155,Phoebe,Fine!
156,Phoebe,You're on!
157,Monica,Okay.
158,Phoebe,"Until then, General Grant, why don't you set up camp  right there."
159,Ross,Hey is Rachel here?
160,Ross,We have a doctor's appointment.
161,Monica,She's in the bathroom.
162,Ross,"Rach, we gotta go."
163,Rachel,In a minute!!
164,Ross,"People ask me why we're not together, I just don't know what to tell them."
165,Rachel,"All right, all right."
166,Rachel,Let's go!
167,Ross,"Uh, do you wanna go change first?"
168,Ross,"The doctor's keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry"
169,Rachel,"No, I'm fine."
170,Ross,Really?
171,Ross,You don't think that's a little inappropriate.
172,Phoebe,Good God man don't anger it.
173,Rachel,"Ross, it is 100 degrees outside."
174,Rachel,"For the first time in weeks, I am somewhat comfortable."
175,Ross,Fine!
176,Ross,Fine!
177,Ross,Y'know what?
178,Ross,Whatever you want.
179,Ross,Okay?
180,Ross,You're the mommy.
181,Rachel,Oh uh-uh pal!
182,Rachel,Don't call me mommy!
183,Rachel,It's bad enough you call your own mother that.
184,Monica,I'm actually with her on this one.
185,Joey,"""I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along."""
186,Joey,"Okay, this is it."
187,Joey,It's my big fight scene coming up.
188,Rachel,Ross.
189,Ross,Yeah?
190,Rachel,Can I ask you something?
191,Ross,Uh-huh.
192,Rachel,When Carol was pregnant with Ben
193,Ross,Mmm?
194,Rachel,were you this irritating?
195,Ross,Wow!
196,Rachel,Excuse me?
197,Ross,Oh nothing.
198,Ross,Nothing!
199,Ross,"Just uh, you've been a little short with me lately."
200,Ross,I'm not trying to irritate you.
201,Rachel,Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
202,Ross,Y'know what?
203,Ross,"The doctor will be in soon, why don't we not speak until then."
204,Rachel,Okay.
205,Rachel,"Seriously, breathe louder Ross!"
206,Rachel,That's great!
207,Ross,Y'know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that's half human and half pure evil!
208,Rachel,"Hi Dr. Long, how are you?"
209,Ross,"Oh, you're nice to her."
210,Rachel,She has the drugs!
211,Rachel,Dr.
212,Rachel,Okay.
213,Rachel,Dr.
214,Rachel,Yeah.
215,Rachel,Dr.
216,Rachel,"Eh, just a tad."
217,Rachel,Dr.
218,Ross,Do them!!
219,Ross,Dr.
220,Rachel,"Well, we are ready to try anything."
221,Rachel,Dr.
222,Rachel,Okay.
223,Rachel,Dr.
224,Rachel,Great!
225,Rachel,We will do all of those.
226,Rachel,Dr.
227,Ross,You've got to be kidding me!
228,Ross,Commercial Break
229,Chandler,Good job Joe!
230,Chandler,Well done!
231,Chandler,Top notch!
232,Joey,You liked it?
233,Joey,You really liked it?
234,Chandler,"Oh-ho-ho, yeah!"
235,Joey,Which part exactly?
236,Chandler,The whole thing!
237,Chandler,Can we go?
238,Joey,"Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics."
239,Chandler,"I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!"
240,Joey,"Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo?"
241,Joey,Did-did you like that part?
242,Chandler,I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
243,Joey,You fell asleep!!
244,Joey,There was no kangaroo!
245,Joey,They didn't take any of my suggestions!
246,Joey,That's for coming buddy.
247,Joey,I'll see you later.
248,Chandler,Don't go!
249,Chandler,I'm sorry.
250,Chandler,I'm so sorry!
251,Chandler,Look!
252,Chandler,This guy fell asleep!
253,Chandler,He fell asleep too!
254,Chandler,Be mad at him!
255,Chandler,"Or, call an ambulance."
256,Monica,Hey!
257,Ross,Hey.
258,Rachel,Hi!
259,Monica,What did the doctor say?
260,Monica,Any news on when the baby will come?
261,Rachel,No.
262,Rachel,But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
263,Ross,"Yeah, we tried them all."
264,Ross,"We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked."
265,Rachel,"Well, there is one thing that we haven't tried, but someone thinks that,  ""That will open up a can of worms."""
266,Monica,Well what is it?
267,Monica,What is it?
268,Monica,"If it's gonna help bring the baby here, like today."
269,Monica,"I mean, I think you should do it."
270,Ross,It's sex.
271,Monica,Do it!
272,Ross,Monica!
273,Monica,I'm just saying it's been a really long time for you.
274,Monica,"I mean, women have needs."
275,Monica,"Do it, get yours!"
276,Phoebe,Oh I-I don't know about that.
277,Phoebe,"No, I think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic."
278,Monica,"All right, let's be practical, if Ross isn't willing to do it, he's not the only guy in the world you can have sex with."
279,Monica,You can borrow ChandlerChandler is good!
280,Ross,"Monica, what is the matter with you?"
281,Monica,Nothing.
282,Monica,I just want the baby to be born today.
283,Rachel,Why?
284,Rachel,Why today?
285,Monica,Okay fine!
286,Monica,I keep betting Phoebe that you're gonna have the baby and I don't want to lose again!
287,Ross,What?!
288,Ross,"While she's been going through this hell, you've been making money?!"
289,Ross,You're betting on your friend staying in this misery?
290,Rachel,I'll take that bet.
291,Ross,What?
292,Rachel,"Well, I'm miserable here!"
293,Rachel,I might as well make some money out it!
294,Ross,Can I get some of that action?
295,Monica,Wait a minute!
296,Monica,Now I'm betting against all three of you?
297,Rachel,"Oh honey, don't worry."
298,Rachel,I really do feel like tomorrow's the day.
299,Monica,"Oh, okay!"
300,Joey,Hey!
301,Joey,Sleeping beauty!
302,Chandler,Where have you been?!
303,Chandler,I tried to call you!
304,Chandler,I want to talk to you!
305,Chandler,I still feel so bad!
306,Joey,"Oh no, were you upset?"
307,Joey,Did you lose sleep?
308,Chandler,I'm so sorry.
309,Joey,"Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us!"
310,Joey,Okay?
311,Joey,"You've done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it!"
312,Joey,"Okay, so how much do I owe you?"
313,Chandler,What?
314,Joey,"Give me a number, I don't want to owe you anything!"
315,Chandler,"You don't owe me anything, I don't want you money"
316,Joey,Ah-ah-ah!
317,Joey,We're doing this!
318,Joey,"Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots."
319,Joey,"Right, how much were those?"
320,Chandler,"I don't know, five hundred dollars?"
321,Joey,"Okay, five hundred dollars."
322,Joey,What else?
323,Chandler,"Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots."
324,Joey,"Okay, so that's another five hundred."
325,Joey,"Five hundred and five hundred, that's"
326,Chandler,Do you want a calculator?
327,Joey,Please!
328,Chandler,Here!
329,Joey,"All right, what else?"
330,Chandler,"Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes"
331,Joey,Which we're still keeping under our hats!
332,Chandler,Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent.
333,Chandler,Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.
334,Joey,"What the hell are you talking about,  ""The south will rise again man."""
335,Chandler,"Yes, money well spent!"
336,Joey,Yeah.
337,Joey,"Okay, what else?"
338,Joey,Rent!
339,Chandler,"Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food"
340,Joey,Okay.
341,Joey,"Okay, so I'm writing you a check forSo you fell asleep during my movie."
342,Joey,Big deal right?
343,Joey,How do you clear this thing?
344,Ross,"Come on, finish your enchilada."
345,Rachel,Ross IWe tried all the spicy food.
346,Rachel,It's not working.
347,Ross,"Okay here, have one of these peppers."
348,Ross,Oh ha Oh God!
349,Ross,Soso hot!
350,Ross,"Oh my By the way, you don't want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye."
351,Rachel,I am feeling nothing.
352,Rachel,"Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you."
353,Ross,Stop it.
354,Rachel,"Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?!"
355,Rachel,We know what's gonna work!
356,Rachel,It's doctor recommended!
357,Ross,"I'm sorry, but we have to have some boundaries!"
358,Ross,"My God, I'm dying."
359,Rachel,"Oh come on Ross, we've done it before we'll do it again, it'll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy."
360,Ross,"This is insane, I'm not gonna make love to you just so that you'll go into labor."
361,Rachel,Make love?
362,Rachel,What are you a girl?
363,Ross,Always a great way to get in a man's pants.
364,Rachel,"But you will, you will be performing a service."
365,Rachel,Okay?
366,Rachel,"Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, y'know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out."
367,Ross,I love when you talk dirty to me.
368,Rachel,"Oh, I know it."
369,Rachel,You're right.
370,Rachel,That's not sexy.
371,Rachel,OhOh!
372,Rachel,Whoops!
373,Rachel,"Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork."
374,Rachel,Let me just bed over and get it.
375,Rachel,Oh God!
376,Ross,Okay enough!
377,Ross,"This is, this is not going to happen."
378,Rachel,Come on Ross!
379,Rachel,I'm miserable here!
380,Rachel,Come on!
381,Rachel,"You started this, now you finish it!"
382,Rachel,"Come on wuss, make love to me."
383,Ross,Y'know what?
384,Rachel,What?
385,Ross,Forget it.
386,Rachel,Oh wow!
387,Rachel,What now Ross you're not gonna talk?
388,Rachel,How on earth will you ever annoy me?
389,Rachel,"Oh wait a minute, I know."
390,Rachel,"I mean you'd think the damn jalepeno would've cleared up your sinuses, but no!!"
391,Rachel,That's not enough  What are you doing?
392,Ross,I'm getting that baby out of you!
393,Rachel,Oh God!
394,Ross,"Oh, I know."
395,Rachel,Oh no.
396,Rachel,No-no!
397,Rachel,I think my water just broke.
398,Ross,I am good.
399,Ross,Okay!
400,Ross,Okay!
401,Ross,"Uh, I got the pillow!"
402,Ross,I got the bag!
403,Ross,You got the keys?
404,Rachel,Okay!
405,Rachel,I got the keys!
406,Rachel,Okay!
407,Rachel,Okay!
408,Ross,Hey!
409,Rachel,Yeah.
410,Ross,We're having a baby.
411,Rachel,"I didn't uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but do you think we have time to"
412,Ross,Not so much.
413,Rachel,Okay.
414,Rachel,Closing Credits
415,Monica,Two hundred.
416,Phoebe,Thank you!
417,Monica,That's it.
418,Monica,I'm done.
419,Monica,"I don't care when the baby comes, no more betting."
420,Phoebe,Okay.
421,Monica,Hello?
422,Monica,Uh-huh.
423,Monica,Uh-huh.
424,Monica,Okay.
425,Monica,I guess we can bet one more time.
426,Phoebe,Is Rachel having the baby?
427,Monica,How did you know that?!
428,Monica,Joey!
429,Monica,Chandler!!
430,Monica,It's time!
431,Phoebe,They're at the coffeehouse.
432,Monica,You know everything!!
433,Monica,"Oh wait, double or nothing."
434,Monica,I bet you the baby is over seven pounds.
435,Monica,I bet you it has hair.
436,Monica,I bet you it's a girl.
437,Phoebe,We know it's a girl!
438,Monica,I'll give you really good odds.
439,Monica,End
0,Joey,How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
1,Monica,I have no idea.
2,Monica,But look how much they spent!
3,Rachel,"Monica, would you calm down?"
4,Rachel,The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
5,Monica,I know.
6,Monica,It's just such reckless spending.
7,Ross,"I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind."
8,Chandler,"Wow, what a geek."
9,Chandler,They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
10,Monica,That's me.
11,Phoebe,Oh!
12,Phoebe,The yuk!
13,Phoebe,"Ross, he's doing it again!"
14,Ross,"Marcel, stop humping the lamp!"
15,Ross,Stop humping!
16,Ross,"Now Marcel, come back-  come here, Marcel-"
17,Rachel,"Oh no, not in my room!"
18,Rachel,I'll get him.
19,Monica,"Ross, you've got to do something about the humping."
20,Ross,What?
21,Ross,"It's, it's just a phase."
22,Chandler,"Well, that's what we said about Joey..."
23,Ross,Would you all relax?
24,Ross,It's not that big a deal.
25,Rachel,Stop it!
26,Rachel,Marcel!
27,Rachel,Bad monkey!
28,Ross,What?
29,Rachel,Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
30,Rachel,Opening Credits
31,Rachel,"Oh, Monica."
32,Rachel,You are not still going over that thing.
33,Monica,This woman's living my life.
34,Rachel,What?
35,Monica,"She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me!"
36,Monica,"Look at this, look."
37,Monica,She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see.
38,Monica,"She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people."
39,Monica,She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
40,Rachel,You're not an artist.
41,Monica,"Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies!"
42,Monica,"I mean, I could do all this stuff."
43,Monica,Only I don't.
44,Rachel,"Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things."
45,Monica,Oh really?
46,Monica,"Okay, let's compare, shall we."
47,Rachel,"Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'..."
48,Monica,Do I go horseback riding in the park?
49,Monica,Do I take classes at the New School?
50,Rachel,Nooo...
51,Monica,This is so unfair!
52,Monica,"She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother."
53,Chandler,How about Joey... Pepponi?
54,Joey,"No, still too ethnic."
55,Joey,My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
56,Chandler,Joey... Switzerland?
57,Joey,"Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe."
58,Joey,"Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big."
59,Joey,Which I'm not.
60,Chandler,Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
61,Joey,Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name?
62,Joey,It sounds familiar.
63,Chandler,"Well, it does not ring a bell with me..."
64,Joey,Joe Stalin.
65,Joey,"Y'know, that's pretty good."
66,Chandler,Might wanna try Joseph.
67,Joey,Joseph Stalin.
68,Joey,I think you'd remember that!
69,Chandler,Oh yes!
70,Chandler,"Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin."
71,Chandler,Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
72,Rachel,Hey.
73,Phoebe,Hey.
74,Monica,Hi.
75,Monica,"Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller."
76,Monica,"Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were."
77,Phoebe,What are you doing?
78,Monica,"Alright, great."
79,Monica,Thanks a lot.
80,Monica,I'm going to tap class.
81,Rachel,"What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?"
82,Monica,"This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is."
83,Rachel,Go to the post office!
84,Rachel,I'm sure her picture's up!
85,Rachel,"...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here!"
86,Rachel,"I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing."
87,Phoebe,This is madness.
88,Phoebe,"It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!!"
89,Phoebe,...Thank you.
90,Monica,What d'you think?
91,Phoebe,Lotsa things.
92,Rachel,Which one do you think she is?
93,Monica,"Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe."
94,Rachel,What does she mean?
95,Phoebe,I think she means  'You dance a dance class'.
96,Phoebe,"Oh, c'mon, c'mon."
97,Monica,"Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?"
98,Rachel,She could be you.
99,Monica,"Okay, I'm not getting this!"
100,Phoebe,I'm totally getting it!
101,Monica,Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
102,Rachel,What?
103,Rachel,You just click when they click.
104,Phoebe,Okay.
105,Phoebe,"And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it."
106,Phoebe,I'm with Rachel.
107,Monica,Great.
108,Monica,It's gym class all over again.
109,Monica,Phoebe and
110,Rachel,Aww.
111,Monica,Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
112,Monica,Oh.
113,Monica,Monica!
114,Monica,...Hi.
115,Monica,I'm Mo- ...nana.
116,Monica,Yeah.
117,Monica,It's Dutch.
118,Monica,Fake
119,Monica,You're kidding!
120,Monica,I-I spent three years in Amsterdam.
121,Monica,"Um, Pennsylvania Dutch."
122,Ross,Hi.
123,Ross,Chandler and
124,Joey,Hey.
125,Joey,Where've you been?
126,Ross,At the vet.
127,Chandler,"She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?"
128,Ross,She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase.
129,Ross,Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
130,Joey,Hey!
131,Joey,He beat ya.
132,Ross,"She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent."
133,Chandler,So what does this mean?
134,Ross,I'm gonna have to give him up.
135,Ross,Commercial Break
136,Joey,"I can't believe it, Ross."
137,Joey,This sucks!
138,Chandler,"I don't get it, I mean, you just got him."
139,Chandler,How can he be an adult already?
140,Ross,I know.
141,Ross,I know.
142,Ross,"I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg."
143,Joey,Isn't there any way you can keep him?
144,Ross,"No, no."
145,Ross,"The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious."
146,Ross,I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
147,Joey,How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
148,Chandler,I know that one!
149,Chandler,"...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen."
150,Ross,"Well, we're applying to a lot of them."
151,Ross,"Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right?"
152,Ross,"But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state."
153,Ross,"Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility."
154,Chandler,"Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach."
155,Chandler,"I mean, it's a total party zoo."
156,Phoebe,Hey.
157,Phoebe,"We found her, we found the girl."
158,Chandler,What?
159,Joey,Did you call the cops?
160,Rachel,Nope.
161,Rachel,We took her to lunch.
162,Chandler,Ah.
163,Chandler,Your own brand of vigilante justice.
164,Ross,What?!
165,Ross,Are you insane?
166,Ross,This woman stole from you.
167,Ross,She stole.
168,Ross,She's a stealer.
169,Monica,Y'know what?
170,Monica,"After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that."
171,Monica,"I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit."
172,Ross,"Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader."
173,Chandler,...Take off their hats!
174,Phoebe,Popes in a Volkswagen!
175,Phoebe,...I love that joke.
176,Rachel,No way.
177,Rachel,No way did you do this.
178,Rachel,Fake
179,Monica,Monana was very brave.
180,Monica,It was so wild.
181,Monica,We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen.
182,Monica,Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
183,Monica,Fake
184,Monica,"So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts..."
185,Monica,...They threw us out!
186,Monica,I was thrown out of a hotel!
187,Monica,Me!
188,Rachel,Go Monana!
189,Rachel,"Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream."
190,Rachel,I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know.
191,Rachel,Don't wait up.
192,Rachel,Fake
193,Monica,"Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show."
194,Monica,'Scuse me?
195,Monica,Fake
196,Monica,There's an open call for Cats.
197,Monica,"I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves."
198,Monica,Whaddya say?
199,Monica,Nononononono.
200,Monica,Think who you're dealing with here.
201,Monica,"I mean, I'm not like you."
202,Monica,I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
203,Monica,Fake
204,Monica,"Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background."
205,Monica,What?
206,Monica,Fake
207,Monica,"Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?"
208,Monica,Right.
209,Monica,"Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned."
210,Monica,Fake
211,Monica,I-I used to be just like you.
212,Monica,And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life.
213,Monica,Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?
214,Monica,Uh-huh.
215,Monica,Fake
216,Monica,I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring.
217,Monica,"I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play?"
218,Monica,What was that?!
219,Monica,"It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre."
220,Monica,"I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.'"
221,Monica,And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
222,Monica,Wow.
223,Monica,Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
224,Ross,Oh God.
225,Ross,We didn't get into Scranton.
226,Ross,That was like our safety zoo.
227,Ross,They take like dogs and cows.
228,Ross,See?
229,Ross,"I don't know who this is harder on, me or him."
230,Phoebe,I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
231,Ross,Marcel!
232,Ross,Marcel!
233,Ross,"Marcel, no!"
234,Ross,Good boy.
235,Ross,"See, how can nobody want him?"
236,Rachel,"Oh, somebody will."
237,Joey,You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
238,Chandler,You're kidding.
239,Joey,Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people.
240,Joey,You'd think you would've known that!
241,Chandler,"Y'know, you'd think I would've."
242,Joey,Phoebe.
243,Joey,Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
244,Phoebe,...Flame Boy.
245,Ross,Where exactly is your zoo?
246,Ross,Dr.
247,Ross,Yes.
248,Ross,Dr.
249,Ross,"No-no, he's, he's very docile."
250,Ross,Dr.
251,Ross,"Well I, I don't know."
252,Ross,Why?
253,Ross,Dr.
254,Ross,"He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean... Dr."
255,Ross,Why- why- why would he need a blade?
256,Ross,Dr.
257,Joey,"He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego."
258,Joey,"We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing..."
259,Chandler,...He's in.
260,Ross,He's in!
261,Ross,"Oh, did you hear that, Marcel?"
262,Ross,San Diego.
263,Ross,San Diego!
264,Ross,Dr.
265,Monica,Yo- hooo!
266,Rachel,Where the hell've you been?
267,Monica,Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
268,Rachel,Are you drunk?
269,Monica,Noooo!
270,Monica,I'm lying.
271,Monica,I am so drunk.
272,Rachel,"Oh God, oh."
273,Rachel,"Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried..."
274,Rachel,Monica?
275,Rachel,Monica!
276,Monica,Water rules!
277,Rachel,"Yes, yes, it does."
278,Rachel,"Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?"
279,Monica,Nope.
280,Monica,Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
281,Rachel,"Okay Monica, what are you doing?"
282,Rachel,You're gonna lose your job!
283,Rachel,This is not you!
284,Monica,"No, it is me!"
285,Monica,"Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in!"
286,Monica,"Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that."
287,Monica,I'm- I'm Monana!
288,Rachel,Hello?
289,Rachel,"Yes, she is, hold on a second, please."
290,Rachel,"Monana, it's for you, the credit card people."
291,Monica,Helloooo?
292,Monica,Yeah.
293,Monica,Oh my God.
294,Monica,Thanks.
295,Rachel,What?

299,Monica,Hey.
300,Monica,How are you?
301,Monica,Fake
302,Monica,I'm not too bad.
303,Monica,"Fortunately, blue's my colour."
304,Monica,How-how did you know I was here?
305,Monica,Because...
306,Monica,I'm Monica Geller.
307,Monica,It was my credit card you were using.
308,Monica,Fake
309,Monica,That I was not expecting.
310,Monica,"I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in."
311,Monica,Fake
312,Monica,Oh.
313,Monica,Thanks.
314,Monica,"No, thank you!"
315,Monica,You have given me so much!
316,Monica,"I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!"
317,Monica,Fake
318,Monica,"Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'."
319,Monica,I just can't believe you're in here.
320,Monica,"I mean, what am I gonna do without you?"
321,Monica,Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me?
322,Monica,Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
323,Monica,Fake
324,Monica,"Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?"
325,Monica,"Well, not... worried, just... wondering."
326,Monica,Fake
327,Monica,"There's nothing to wonder about, Monica."
328,Monica,"You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are."
329,Monica,Not necessarily...
330,Monica,Fake
331,Monica,Yes necessarily!
332,Monica,"I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing."
333,Monica,"Um, I'm not actually Amish."
334,Monica,Fake
335,Monica,Really?
336,Monica,Then why are you like that?
337,Monica,In.
338,Monica,"Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!"
339,Phoebe,Okay.
340,Phoebe,"Good-bye, little monkey guy."
341,Phoebe,"Alright, I wrote you this poem."
342,Phoebe,"Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane."
343,Ross,Aww.
344,Ross,"Thank you, Aunt Phoebe."
345,Phoebe,Oh!
346,Chandler,"Okay, bye, champ."
347,Chandler,"Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn."
348,Joey,"I dunno what to say, Ross."
349,Joey,"Uh, it's a monkey."
350,Ross,"Just, just say what you feel."
351,Joey,"Marcel, I'm hungry."
352,Ross,That was good.
353,Rachel,"Marcel, this is for you."
354,Rachel,"It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane."
355,Ross,"Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him."
356,Ross,"Marcel, c'mere, c'mere."
357,Ross,"Well buddy, this is it."
358,Ross,There's just a coupla things I want to say.
359,Ross,"I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you."
360,Ross,"You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be-  Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone?"
361,Ross,Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?!
362,Ross,"Marcel, would- okay, just take him away."
363,Ross,Just take him.
364,Ross,Closing Credits

7,Phoebe,"Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?"
8,Rachel,"Oh, it ended very well."
9,Phoebe,Oh.
10,Monica,Do not start without me.
11,Monica,Do not start without me.
12,Phoebe,"Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss."
13,Phoebe,"Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips?"
14,Phoebe,"Or was it like a, you know, a ""I gotta have you now"" kind of thing?"
15,Rachel,"Well, at first it was really intense, you know."
16,Rachel,"And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it."
17,Phoebe,"Ok, so, ok, was he holding you?"
18,Phoebe,Or was his hand like on your back?
19,Rachel,"No, actually first they started on my waist."
20,Rachel,"And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair."
21,Rachel,PHOE/MNCA
22,Ross,"And, uh, and then I kissed her."

30,Chandler,"Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s."
31,Phoebe,Wow.
32,Phoebe,What are you gonna use it for?
33,Chandler,Games and stuff.
34,Monica,There are no jobs.
35,Monica,There are no jobs for me.
36,Joey,"Wait, here's one."
37,Joey,"Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?"
38,Monica,There's an ad for a naked chef?
39,Joey,"No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked."
40,Joey,And then...
41,Ross,Hi.
42,Phoebe,"Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?"
43,Ross,"That, that is funny."
44,Ross,That is painfully funny.
45,Ross,"No, wait."
46,Ross,"Wait, yeah, that's just painful"
47,Monica,Wait a minute.
48,Monica,I thought last night was great.
49,Ross,"Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table."
50,Ross,"And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing?"
51,Ross,"I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?"
52,Joey,You got all that from saline solution?
53,Monica,We are talking about Rachel here.
54,Monica,You and Rachel.
55,Ross,"Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now."

64,Ross,"Hi, Julie."
65,Ross,"Julie, um, how are you?"
66,Ross,"Good, so everybody's here."
67,Ross,Everybody's good.
68,Ross,"So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe?"
69,Phoebe,"Oh, well, actually."
70,Ross,Play it.
71,Phoebe,"Ok, all right."
72,Joey,"Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses."
73,Ross,Ssshh.
74,Phoebe,"Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up."
75,Phoebe,"Um, it's called, um, ""Two of Them Kissed Last Night""."
76,Phoebe,"There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil."
77,Phoebe,"Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real."
78,Phoebe,"Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside."
79,Phoebe,Will Betty be the one who he loves truly?
80,Phoebe,Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie?
81,Phoebe,"He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide!"
82,Monica,"So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail?"
83,Monica,The ad wasn't too clear.
84,Monica,I'm sorry?
85,Monica,Ohh.
86,Monica,All right.
87,Monica,Mmm-mmm.
88,Monica,I love how it crumbles.
89,Monica,"Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that."
90,Monica,Mmm-mmm.
91,Monica,Wow.
92,Monica,Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
93,Monica,Mmm.
94,Monica,Abso......lutely.
95,Monica,"See, I love creating new recipes."
96,Monica,I love Thanksgiving.
97,Monica,"And, well, now, I love Mockolate."
98,Monica,"Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas."
99,Monica,How about Mockolate mousse?
100,Phoebe,"It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y."
101,Monica,"Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?"
102,Phoebe,What makes it pilgrim?
103,Monica,We'll put buckles on it.
104,Rachel,Hey.
105,Phoebe,Hey.
106,Monica,Hey.
107,Rachel,"Did uh, Ross call?"
108,Monica,"No, I'm sorry."
109,Rachel,Why didn't he call?
110,Rachel,"He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he?"
111,Rachel,"He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, ""Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together."""
112,Phoebe,"No offense, but that sounds nothing like her."
113,Ross,I don't know what to do.
114,Ross,What am I gonna do?
115,Ross,"I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare."
116,Chandler,"Oh, I know."
117,Chandler,This must be so hard.
118,Chandler,"Oh, no."
119,Chandler,Two women love me.
120,Chandler,They're both gorgeous and sexy.
121,Chandler,"My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight."
122,Joey,"Hey, here's a thought, Ross."
123,Chandler,Don't touch the computer.
124,Chandler,Don't ever touch the computer.
125,Joey,"Ross, listen."
126,Joey,I got two words for you.
127,Joey,Threesome.
128,Chandler,"Ok, all right, look."
129,Chandler,"Let's get logical about this, ok?"
130,Chandler,We'll make a list.
131,Chandler,"Rachel and Julie, pros and cons."
132,Chandler,Oh.
133,Chandler,"We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column."
134,Ross,Can't we just use a pen?
135,Chandler,"No, Amish boy."
136,Joey,"Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun."
137,Joey,"All right, Rachel first."
138,Ross,I don't know.
139,Ross,"I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes."
140,Joey,You could say that.
141,Ross,"And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know."
142,Ross,And I've seen her be a little too into her looks.
143,Ross,"Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress."
144,Chandler,Waitress.
145,Chandler,Got it.
146,Chandler,You guys wanna play Doom?
147,Chandler,Or we could keep doing this.
148,Chandler,What else?
149,Ross,I don't know.
150,Joey,"Oh, her ankles are a little chubby."
151,Chandler,"Ok, let's do Julie."
152,Chandler,What's wrong with her?
153,Ross,She's not Rachel.
154,Monica,"Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust."
155,Monica,"This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies."
156,Monica,Just like the Indians served.
157,Rachel,Oh my god.
158,Monica,Oh my god good?
159,Rachel,"Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth."
160,Phoebe,"Oh, oh sweet Lord!"
161,Phoebe,This is what evil must taste like!
162,Chandler,I'm telling you this thing won't print.
163,Chandler,"Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times."
164,Chandler,"You know, for a hot line you are not so hot."
165,Chandler,What?
166,Chandler,What is that in the background?
167,Chandler,Are you watching Star Trek?
168,Joey,"Hey, so how'd it go with Julie?"
169,Joey,"Did you, did you break her heart?"
170,Ross,"Yes, it was horrible."
171,Ross,She cried.
172,Ross,I cried.
173,Ross,"She threw things, they hit me."
174,Ross,"Anyway, I did the right thing."
175,Chandler,"So, Spock actually hugs his father?"
176,Rachel,"Hey, do you guys have......hi."
177,Ross,Hi.
178,Rachel,Where you goin'?
179,Ross,"I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's."
180,Rachel,Oh.
181,Ross,"No, no, uh, it's not what you think."
182,Ross,It's um the other thing.
183,Rachel,"Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?"
184,Ross,"Well, uh."
185,Joey,He broke up with Julie.
186,Joey,"Well, go hug her, for god's sakes."
187,Rachel,Really?
188,Ross,Really.
189,Ross,"It's always been you, Rach."
190,Rachel,"Oh, god."
191,Rachel,JOEY/CHAN
192,Rachel,"Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good."
193,Ross,"I know, I know, it's, it's almost... What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?"
194,Rachel,Let me get my coat.
195,Ross,"Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat."
196,Rachel,"Ok, he's goin' to get my coat."
197,Rachel,He's goin' to get my coat.
198,Rachel,"Oh my god, you guys."
199,Rachel,I can't believe this.
200,Rachel,This is unbelievable.
201,Rachel,What's that?
202,Chandler,What?
203,Chandler,Nothing.
204,Rachel,What's that?
205,Rachel,What?
206,Rachel,I saw my name.
207,Rachel,What is it?
208,Chandler,"No, no, see?"
209,Chandler,See?
210,Chandler,"Hey, it's printing."
211,Chandler,"Hey, it's printing!"
212,Rachel,Well what is it?
213,Rachel,Let me see.
214,Ross,"Hey, someone order a coat?"
215,Rachel,"Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see."
216,Ross,He won't?
217,Ross,He won't!
218,Ross,"Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?"
219,Chandler,"Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing."
220,Rachel,And I'm in it?
221,Rachel,Then let me read it.
222,Rachel,"CHAN, JOEY,"
223,Ross,No!
224,Rachel,Come on.
225,Joey,"Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?"
226,Chandler,Alright.
227,Chandler,"""It was summer, and it was hot."
228,Chandler,Rachel was there.
229,Chandler,A lonely gray couch.
230,Chandler,"'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever."
231,Chandler,"The end."""
232,Ross,That's it?
233,Ross,That's all you wrote?
234,Ross,You're the worst writer in the whole world.
235,Rachel,"All right, you know what?"
236,Rachel,This isn't funny anymore.
237,Rachel,There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.
238,Ross,"No, you don't."
239,Rachel,"All right, you know what, that's fine."
240,Rachel,"If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine."
241,Rachel,I do not need to see it.
242,Rachel,What is this?
243,Rachel,"Ross, what is this?"
244,Chandler,Good luck.
245,Ross,"Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?"
246,Rachel,Kind of ditzy?
247,Rachel,Too into her looks?
248,Rachel,Spoiled?
249,Ross,Now that's a little spoiled.
250,Ross,"He was supposed to type ""little"", the idiot."
251,Rachel,Just a waitress?
252,Ross,"No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?"
253,Rachel,Oh!
254,Rachel,I do not have chubby ankles!
255,Ross,"No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side."
256,Ross,Look at Julie's column.
257,Rachel,She is not Rachem.
258,Rachel,What the hell's a Rachem?
259,Rachel,Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.
260,Ross,"No, Rach, come on."
261,Ross,Rach!
262,Ross,"Rach, no, no!"
263,Ross,"She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?"
264,Chandler,My diary!
265,Chandler,"My diary, that's brilliant."
266,Chandler,"I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary."
267,Monica,"You know, that's true."
268,Monica,You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
269,Phoebe,I...
270,Phoebe,I cannot believe Ross even made this list.
271,Phoebe,What a dinkus.
272,Joey,"Hey, cut him some slack."
273,Joey,It was Chandler's idea.
274,Phoebe,What?
275,Monica,What?
276,Chandler,"Oh good, I was hoping that would come up."
277,Monica,This was your idea?
278,Phoebe,What were you thinking?
279,Chandler,"All right, let's get some perspective here, ok?"
280,Chandler,"These things, they happen for a reason."
281,Monica,Yeah.
282,Monica,You!
283,Chandler,"All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok?"
284,Chandler,"You believe in that karma crap, don't you?"
285,Phoebe,"Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle."
286,Ross,Rach!
287,Ross,Whoops!
288,Ross,"Rach, hey, open up, please!"
289,Rachel,"When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away."
290,Rachel,That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.
291,Ross,I just wanna read something.
292,Ross,It's your pro list.
293,Rachel,Not interested.
294,Ross,"Ok, ok, number"
295,Ross,Number
296,Joey,"Hey, Ross!"
297,Joey,What are you doin'?
298,Ross,"Hey, Joey."
299,Ross,You wanna open the window?
300,Joey,"Oh, yeah, I do."
301,Chandler,What are you doing out there?
302,Ross,"I am, uh, I am..."
303,Monica,"Oh, you must be freezing."
304,Monica,You know what you need?
305,Monica,How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?
306,Ross,"Rach, come on, open up."
307,Ross,"Rach, come on, come on, Rach."
308,Ross,You got to give me another chance.
309,Rachel,No.
310,Ross,No?
311,Rachel,That's what I said.
312,Chandler,"Look, maybe we should go?"
313,Rachel,"No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking."
314,Ross,"Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel."
315,Rachel,"No, you don't, Ross."
316,Rachel,Imagine the worst things you think about yourself.
317,Rachel,"Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you."
318,Ross,"No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things."
319,Rachel,"Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross."
320,Rachel,I said don't go!
321,Ross,You know what?
322,Ross,You know what?
323,Ross,"If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you."
324,Rachel,"Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us."
325,Rachel,"See, I'd never make a list."
326,Joey,"I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know?"
327,Joey,Maybe a little longer.
328,Monica,"Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars."
329,Monica,"I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate."
330,Monica,What?
331,Monica,"Oh, gosh, I'm sorry."
332,Monica,"Well, uh, I ate some."
333,Monica,Hello?
334,Ross,Hi.
335,Rachel,Is that him again?
336,Rachel,"Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down."
337,Monica,"Listen, I..."
338,Monica,I don't think this is the best time.
339,Ross,"Look, can, can you do something for me?"
340,Monica,"Sure, what?"
341,Monica,"Ok, ok.   Music?"
342,Monica,"Oh, not at all."
343,Monica,I have no morals and I need the cash.
344,Monica,Cat hair.
0,Chandler,"Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica?"
1,Chandler,I can't figure this out!
2,Chandler,It's so hard!
3,Chandler,Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or aah-ah!
4,Chandler,Paper cut!
5,Phoebe,"Now, have you told anyone else?"
6,Chandler,"No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out."
7,Phoebe,You told me.
8,Chandler,"Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures."
9,Phoebe,"Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off."
10,Phoebe,I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet.
11,Chandler,Me too.
12,Joey,Hey.
13,Chandler,Hey.
14,Phoebe,Hey!
15,Phoebe,"So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?"
16,Chandler,Oh all right.
17,Phoebe,"Yeah, coffeehouse."
18,Ross,"Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go."
19,Chandler,"Oh well, we don't because we gottheother pl-place."
20,Ross,How rude.
21,Joey,"Oh, I'm sorry."
22,Joey,You wanna bite?
23,Joey,Opening Credits
24,Phoebe,So how are things going with Paul?
25,Rachel,Good.
26,Rachel,"Although y'know, he-he's a private guy."
27,Rachel,"Y'know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings."
28,Phoebe,That's easy!
29,Phoebe,You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.
30,Rachel,So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
31,Phoebe,No that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
32,Rachel,Hi!
33,Phoebe,Watch this.
34,Rachel,Okay.
35,Phoebe,Hi Paul!
36,Phoebe,So how are things going with you?
37,Rachel,Okay.
38,Ross,Hi!
39,Ross,Great to see you!
40,Ross,How you doing?
41,Ross,Okay!
42,Ross,You take care!
43,Ross,"Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?"
44,Phoebe,Yeah!
45,Phoebe,"That was so weird, huh?"
46,Ross,"Phoebe, why'd you do it?"
47,Phoebe,I didn't do it!
48,Phoebe,It was Chandler!
49,Phoebe,He's He's mad at you!
50,Ross,What?!
51,Ross,Why?
52,Phoebe,"Please, I think you know why."
53,Ross,I can't think of anything.
54,Phoebe,"Come on Ross, you're a paleontologist, dig a little deeper."
55,Ross,"Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn't invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?"
56,Phoebe,Do you think that's something that he'd be mad at you for?
57,Ross,I guess it could.
58,Phoebe,Well then I think that's it.
59,Ross,"Well, if he's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up."
60,Ross,I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.
61,Phoebe,"Oh, if that's what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table."
62,Rachel,Yeah that's great.
63,Rachel,"But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me."
64,Rachel,Tell me about your day.
65,Rachel,Okay.
66,Rachel,"Hey, what are you thinking?"
67,Rachel,What are you thinking right now?
68,Rachel,"Yeah that's great Paul, but y'know I wanna know whatWow, those are really great!"
69,Rachel,"I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior."
70,Rachel,Y'know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.
71,Rachel,"No Paul, I don't know anything about you!"
72,Rachel,"Y'know, like-like your childhood!"
73,Rachel,Tell me about your childhood!
74,Rachel,"Okay, well then how about puberty!"
75,Rachel,"Come on, that's always a painful time!"
76,Rachel,Y'know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you're sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
77,Rachel,"Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky."
78,Rachel,"Anyway, umm The rest of you life, y'know?"
79,Rachel,Any regrets?
80,Rachel,"All right Paul, I'm not asking for a lot here."
81,Rachel,Okay?
82,Rachel,Just give me something.
83,Rachel,Anything!
84,Rachel,Okay.
85,Rachel,All right.
86,Rachel,Hm-mmm.
87,Rachel,That's-that's great!
88,Rachel,See?
89,Rachel,I already feel like I know you a little better!
90,Rachel,Thank you.
91,Rachel,"Okay, come on."
92,Rachel,Now we can go eat.
93,Rachel,Let's go.
94,Rachel,Oh!
95,Rachel,Yeah.
96,Rachel,"Yeah, I-I-I see the scare."
97,Rachel,"Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y'know, you shared your feelings."
98,Rachel,"It's really, it's beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?"
99,Rachel,What?!
100,Rachel,Wait!
101,Rachel,What are you talking about?!
102,Rachel,You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
103,Rachel,"My God, I'm sorry!"
104,Rachel,I'm sorry!
105,Rachel,I didn't mean to do that!
106,Rachel,I wouldn't do that!
107,Chandler,Nothin!
108,Chandler,This is the nine millionth ring store we've been too and I can't find the perfect ring!
109,Chandler,Ugly ring!
110,Chandler,Ugly ring!
111,Chandler,Ugly ring!
112,Chandler,It's a beautiful selection.
113,Phoebe,"Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring."
114,Phoebe,Maybe you-maybe you do something different.
115,Phoebe,Y'know?
116,Phoebe,"Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y'know?"
117,Phoebe,Or an engagement tiara?
118,Phoebe,Orooh!
119,Phoebe,An engagement Revolutionary War musket!
120,Phoebe,(Picks one up from the display in the corner.
121,Chandler,"Y'know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this."
122,Phoebe,Huh?
123,Phoebe,Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
124,Chandler,"Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring."
125,Chandler,"Oh, this one's nice!"
126,Chandler,I like this one!
127,Chandler,Sir?
128,Chandler,"Uh, kind sir?"
129,Chandler,Can I see this one?
130,Phoebe,"Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me."
131,Phoebe,Okay?
132,Phoebe,I know how to haggle.
133,Phoebe,So let me handle this from here on out.
134,Phoebe,Male
135,Chandler,"Uh-uh, yes."
136,Chandler,I would like to see that ring please.
137,Phoebe,"Or not, whatever."
138,Phoebe,Male
139,Chandler,"Sir, can I ask you to umm, could youhold out that ring and ask me to marry you?"
140,Chandler,Male
141,Chandler,"Oh my God that's it, that's the ring!"
142,Chandler,How much is it?
143,Phoebe,"Chandler, I-I will handle this!"
144,Phoebe,How much is it?
145,Phoebe,Male
146,Phoebe,We will give you $10.
147,Phoebe,Male
148,Chandler,Yes!
149,Chandler,"Yes, but I can only pay $8,000."
150,Chandler,Male
151,Phoebe,We stand firm at $10.
152,Phoebe,Male
153,Chandler,"Uh, credit card."
154,Chandler,Oh no!
155,Chandler,"No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey."
156,Chandler,"Okay, I'll go get it."
157,Chandler,You guard the ring.
158,Phoebe,Okay.
159,Phoebe,"Listen, I'm sorry about before."
160,Phoebe,Do you have anything her for $10.
161,Phoebe,Male
162,Phoebe,I'll give you $1 for them.
163,Ross,"Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?"
164,Joey,No.
165,Ross,Remember?
166,Ross,You-you were eating pizza.
167,Joey,Yeah.
168,Ross,Okay.
169,Ross,"Well, apparently Chandler's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago."
170,Joey,"Oh, we're supposed to just get him a ticket?!"
171,Joey,That guy is always mooching off of us!
172,Ross,Yeah!
173,Ross,"Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y'know?"
174,Ross,"Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him."
175,Joey,Oh wow that's a great idea!
176,Joey,And I still have his credit card.
177,Ross,Oh.
178,Joey,"Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one."
179,Joey,Here you go.
180,Joey,"Y'know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I justI don't get Chandler."
181,Joey,"Y'know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don't get all upset."
182,Ross,All the time?
183,Joey,All the time!
184,Rachel,Oh my God!
185,Rachel,Oh my God!
186,Monica,Still crying?
187,Rachel,Like a little girl.
188,Rachel,I know.
189,Rachel,I know.
190,Rachel,I know.
191,Rachel,This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up.
192,Rachel,"But God, I didn't know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!"
193,Monica,"Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up."
194,Monica,And one of them is sex.
195,Rachel,What's the other one?
196,Monica,"I don't know, I've never had to use the other one."
197,Monica,"I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking."
198,Rachel,Oh that's right.
199,Rachel,You're the talker.
200,Rachel,"Anyway uh, great idea!"
201,Rachel,"Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues."
202,Monica,"Oh, we have some"
203,Rachel,No you don't!
204,Phoebe,"Okay umm, I'd also like to try on the tiara."
205,Phoebe,Oh yeah.
206,Phoebe,Okay.
207,Phoebe,"What do you think, too much?"
208,Phoebe,Male
209,Phoebe,Okay.
210,Phoebe,"Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again."
211,Phoebe,Something's missing.
212,Phoebe,"It's not Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out."

224,Chandler,"Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads."
225,Chandler,Yeah?
226,Chandler,I'm a little busy here Paul.
227,Chandler,"Okay, a quick one."
228,Chandler,Come on hug it out.
229,Chandler,Oh hey!
230,Chandler,There you go.
231,Chandler,Okay.
232,Chandler,Okay!
233,Joey,Hey!
234,Joey,Whoa-whoa-hey-hey!
235,Joey,"Hi, Paul is it?"
236,Chandler,Do you have my credit card?
237,Joey,"Yes, it's in my Inin my pocket."
238,Joey,My back pocket!
239,Joey,My back pocket!
240,Chandler,Thank God!
241,Joey,Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
242,Chandler,"Oh, I can't go."
243,Joey,Come on!
244,Joey,It'll be fun!
245,Joey,"Me, you, and Ross, and Paul probably"
246,Phoebe,"Chandler, I found the perfect ring."
247,Chandler,"Oh, that's uh, that's pretty nice but I'm gonna go with the one I picked first."
248,Phoebe,"Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone."
249,Phoebe,It's over!
250,Chandler,What?
251,Phoebe,Some guy bought it.
252,Phoebe,I'm sorry.
253,Phoebe,I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail!
254,Chandler,They put you in jail?
255,Phoebe,The little jail between the doors!
256,Chandler,"Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!"
257,Phoebe,"I know, I'm sorry!"
258,Phoebe,"But y'know, this ring is better!"
259,Phoebe,Monica never even saw the other ring.
260,Chandler,Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
261,Phoebe,Maybe it was the guy.
262,Chandler,It was the ring!
263,Ross,Hey!
264,Ross,"So uh, was he excited about the tickets?"
265,Joey,No!
266,Joey,He blew us off!
267,Ross,What?
268,Joey,I know!
269,Ross,I can't believe it.
270,Ross,Can I tell you something?
271,Ross,I'm a little mad at him now.
272,Joey,Can I tell you something?
273,Joey,Me too.
274,Ross,Y'know what?
275,Ross,"He didn't want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don't talk to him at all!"
276,Joey,Ooooh!
277,Joey,Freeze him out.
278,Ross,That's right!
279,Joey,I like it!
280,Ross,Eh?
281,Ross,We'll show him!
282,Joey,"From now on, it's gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends."
283,Joey,Okay!
284,Joey,We're gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.

286,Rachel,I'm back.
287,Rachel,Ah that's great.
288,Rachel,No actually that's  That's great!
289,Rachel,That's really great!
290,Rachel,"Y'know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot."
291,Rachel,A lover?
292,Rachel,Oh yeah surfer?
293,Rachel,"Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh,  get a little more comfortable here."
294,Rachel,"Wait, now wait a second, this isn't too revealing is it?"
295,Rachel,I don't care about the little dude!
296,Rachel,I can't!
297,Rachel,I cannot listen to anymore of this!
298,Rachel,"Y'know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional!"
299,Rachel,And then it's only because they get paid $100 an hour!
300,Rachel,Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you?
301,Rachel,"$2,000!"
302,Rachel,And do you know when I figured that out?
303,Rachel,While you were talking!
304,Rachel,Oh I'm sorry.
305,Rachel,I I-I don't meanI didn't mean to stifle you.
306,Rachel,I This is all just a little overwhelming.
307,Rachel,"I'm so glad, I'm so glad you shared."
308,Rachel,And I'm glad that you're done.
309,Rachel,What do you say we umm
310,Phoebe,Hey.
311,Chandler,I can't believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
312,Phoebe,It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring!
313,Phoebe,It's a beautiful ring!
314,Chandler,"No, it's not!"
315,Chandler,"When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y'know?"
316,Chandler,And I could see her saying yes.
317,Chandler,"When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring!"
318,Chandler,Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye.
319,Chandler,"Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life."
320,Chandler,I wanna make sure it's perfect.
321,Phoebe,Okay.
322,Phoebe,There may be a way that we can get the other ring back.
323,Phoebe,Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose.
324,Phoebe,So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
325,Chandler,I can't do that.
326,Phoebe,Well you certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.
327,Phoebe,There he is!
328,Chandler,Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
329,Phoebe,Wow!
330,Phoebe,You're good!
331,Phoebe,"After this, we should solve crimes."
332,Chandler,Yeah!
333,Chandler,"Okay, go, go, go get him."
334,Phoebe,"Oh, okay."
335,Phoebe,Excuse me sir?
336,Phoebe,Could you come with me please?
337,Phoebe,You have a phone call.
338,Phoebe,It is your office.
339,Phoebe,John?
340,Phoebe,Here he is.
341,Chandler,Hi!
342,Chandler,Hi.
343,Chandler,"Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you're about to propose with was supposed to be held for me."
344,Chandler,"So, I'm gonna need to have that back."
345,Chandler,"But, in exchange I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring."
346,Chandler,Ew.
347,Phoebe,Wow!
348,Phoebe,I would trade.
349,Chandler,No-no!
350,Chandler,This is my fiancee  and her heart was set on that ring.
351,Chandler,You don't want to break her heart now do you?
352,Phoebe,"Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman's heart?"
353,Chandler,"Yeah, she's dying Of a cough apparently."
354,Phoebe,"Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring."
355,Phoebe,"See, if I'm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity"
356,Chandler,"Okay, that's enough honey!"
357,Chandler,Great!
358,Chandler,"Okay, here."
359,Chandler,Thank you.
360,Chandler,Thank you.

375,Chandler,"Yep, pretty much."
376,Ross,You-you're gonna get married?!
377,Ross,I mean We're gonna be brothers-in-law!
378,Joey,"And-and-and-and-and-and, and we're gonna be friends again!"

405,Ross,You told her before you told us?
406,Chandler,"Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures."
407,Chandler,"You can understand that, right?"
408,Chandler,Guys?
409,Chandler,Guys?
410,Chandler,End
0,Phoebe,Hey!
1,Chandler,Hey!
2,Chandler,"Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum."
3,Phoebe,Ha-ha.
4,Phoebe,"No, it's just I'm so pregnant that Imy guitar doesn't fit anymore."
5,Phoebe,"So I thought til I'm not, I'm just gonna play all my songs on this drum."
6,Phoebe,It sounds really cool!
7,Chandler,All right.
8,Phoebe,Listen.
9,Phoebe,Listen.
10,Phoebe,"Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?"
11,Joey,"Wow, Pheebs!"
12,Joey,That sounds great!
13,Phoebe,I know!
14,Phoebe,"I know, and I've only been playing for like an hour!"
15,Phoebe,Hey!
16,Phoebe,What are you doing here?
17,Phoebe,"Oh, well, don't tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus."
18,Chandler,Wouldn't that be Frank the III?
19,Phoebe,Wow!
20,Phoebe,That's so great!
21,Phoebe,Oh!
22,Phoebe,Oh!
23,Phoebe,Cougar.
24,Ross,"Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra."
25,Ross,"Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock's a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes."
26,Ross,"Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes?"
27,Ross,Twice?
28,Ross,"Hey, uh, you can ignore that."
29,Ross,"Uhh, believe me when he's older, he'll understand."
30,Ross,I'll be right there.
31,Ross,Hello!
32,Ross,Hello!
33,Ross,Hey.
34,Ross,"Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan."
35,Ross,"Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so"
36,Ross,Oh come on!
37,Ross,That's-that's true.
38,Phoebe,Hi!
39,Joey,Hey!
40,Chandler,Hey!
41,Chandler,Do we have a baby name yet?
42,Phoebe,Ugh!
43,Phoebe,No!
44,Phoebe,This is so hard!
45,Phoebe,I went through this whole book  and found nothing!
46,Phoebe,"I want a name that's really like, y'know strong and confident, y'know?"
47,Phoebe,Like-like Exxon.
48,Chandler,"Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid."
49,Joey,"Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name?"
50,Joey,"How about, The Hulk?"
51,Phoebe,"No, I'm-I'm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with ""The."""
52,Joey,"Oh, want a good name, go with Joey."
53,Joey,Joey's your pal.
54,Joey,Joey's your buddy.
55,Joey,"""Where is everybody?"""
56,Joey,"""Well, they're hanging out with Joey."""
57,Chandler,"Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler."
58,Chandler,"Oh, come on!"
59,Chandler,"Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him."
60,Joey,"Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too!"
61,Joey,"But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there."
62,Chandler,"Well, Chandler will be there for you too."
63,Chandler,"I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there."
64,Chandler,"And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot."
65,Joey,What do ya say?
66,Joey,What do ya say?
67,Phoebe,"Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names."
68,Phoebe,"But, all right, I don'tmaybe I'll just name him The Hulk."
69,Joey,I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it!
70,Joey,That's what I wanted to name my kid!
71,Rachel,"Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing."
72,Monica,Y'know what?
73,Monica,It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
74,Rachel,Sorry.
75,Rachel,I'm so exited!
76,Rachel,I've been waiting for this for months!
77,Rachel,I got my hair coloured!
78,Rachel,I got new sheets!
79,Rachel,I'm making him a very fancy meal.
80,Monica,Um-hmm.
81,Rachel,What am I making him by the way?
82,Monica,"Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup."
83,Rachel,I thought I was making him filet mignon?
84,Monica,"Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant."
85,Monica,"And then you realised if you  bitched about it, then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke."
86,Rachel,"Wow, I really get crabby when I cook."
87,Ross,Hey!
88,Joey,Hey!
89,Chandler,Hey!
90,Ross,"So uh, Emily called last night"
91,Chandler,And now you're giving me the message!
92,Ross,Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan.
93,Ross,"Yeah, they're going to the theatre together!"
94,Ross,They're going to dinner!
95,Ross,They're going horseback riding!
96,Phoebe,"God, Susan is so fun!"
97,Ross,"Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay?"
98,Ross,"For like, for like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard"
99,Chandler,You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
100,Ross,"Hey, they're going to the gym together!"
101,Ross,Two women!
102,Ross,Stretching!
103,Ross,Y'know they-they take a steam together!
104,Ross,Things get a little playfuldidn't you see Personal Best?
105,Joey,"No, but I'm gonna!"
106,Chandler,Hi!
107,Chandler,Hi!
108,Chandler,You're crazy!
109,Chandler,Okay?
110,Chandler,This is Emily.
111,Chandler,Emily is straight.
112,Ross,How do you know?
113,Ross,I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!
114,Phoebe,"Yeah, I definitely."
115,Phoebe,I don't like the name Ross.
116,Ross,What a weird way to kick me when I'm down.
117,Phoebe,No!
118,Phoebe,No!
119,Phoebe,I-I meant for the baby!
120,Ross,Oh.
121,Ross,What's wrong with Ross?
122,Phoebe,"Well, it's just y'know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y'know"
123,Ross,"Actually that-that's not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No."
124,Ross,"72, Dr. Bruce Banner found  Y'know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend's a lesbian."
125,Phoebe,"So, I decided I'm definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler."
126,Joey,Oh!
127,Joey,"Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey!"
128,Joey,"I mean, name one famous person named Chandler."
129,Chandler,Raymond Chandler.
130,Joey,Someone you didn't make up!
131,Chandler,"Okay, there are no famous Joey's."
132,Chandler,"Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco."
133,Joey,"Yeah, that guy really hurt us."
134,Phoebe,"Well, how about a compromise then, okay?"
135,Phoebe,"What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?"
136,Chandler,"Okay, look, Joey!"
137,Chandler,"Come on, think about it, first of all, he'll never be President."
138,Chandler,There's never gonna be a President Joey.
139,Joey,"All right look man, I didn't want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life!"
140,Joey,It's not even a name; it's barely even a word.
141,Joey,Okay?
142,Joey,"It's kinda like chandelier, but it's not!"
143,Joey,All right?
144,Joey,"It's a stupid, stupid non-name!"
145,Chandler,"Wow, you're, you're right."
146,Chandler,"I have a horrible, horrible name."
147,Joey,"I'm sorry man, I didn'tI'm-I'm sorry."
148,Joey,I'm sorry.
149,Chandler,Okay.
150,Joey,So I guess it's Joey then!
151,Rachel,"Ohh, please!"
152,Rachel,Cooking soothes me.
153,Rachel,Ahh.
154,Rachel,"So, dig in!"
155,Rachel,Hmmm!
156,Rachel,"Oh I know, my God, this is sothis rice is soI am so good."
157,Rachel,"Oh, yeah, I'm sorry."
158,Rachel,They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
159,Rachel,"Yeah, sure, okay."
160,Rachel,Okay.
161,Joey,"Hey, how did you do that?!"
162,Joey,Come on in.
163,Rachel,All gone!
164,Rachel,"So, farm birds, huh?"
165,Rachel,Oh.
166,Rachel,Okay.
167,Rachel,"So, can I serve you a little ofWhat?"
168,Rachel,What?
169,Rachel,What?
170,Rachel,"But, they're across the hall!"
171,Rachel,"I mean that's two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here."
172,Rachel,"Okay, y'know, would you feel better if we went someplace else?"
173,Rachel,I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y'know go to your apartment.
174,Rachel,Your parents'?
175,Rachel,Ohh.
176,Rachel,Yeah that works.
177,Ross,Hey!
178,Ross,"Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, ""No."""
179,Ross,"I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, ""No."""
180,Ross,"I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, ""No."""
181,Ross,"So, he's sweeping."
182,Ross,"So umm, any word from Susan?"
183,Ross,Uh-huh.
184,Ross,Uh-huh.
185,Ross,"Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don't know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?"
186,Ross,"Y'know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married."
187,Ross,Am I?
188,Ross,Am I?
189,Ross,"Uh-huh, Carol, so were we."
190,Ross,"All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off."
191,Ross,Y'know?
192,Ross,"Say-say they're coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they're laughing, y'know, someone innocently touches someone else There's electricity, it's new."
193,Ross,It's exciting.
194,Ross,Are you telling me there isn't even the slightest possibility of something happening?
195,Ross,OH MY GOD!!
196,Ross,I didn't really believe it until you just said it!
197,Rachel,Wow!
198,Rachel,This place is fabulous!
199,Rachel,"Whoa-whoa, there's two living rooms?"
200,Rachel,"God, growing up here, this place must've been a real babe magnet."
201,Rachel,"Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet."
202,Rachel,Wanna make out?
203,Rachel,That sounds like a plan.
204,Rachel,"Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?"
205,Rachel,Ah.
206,Rachel,Mrs.
207,Rachel,Hi you!
208,Rachel,"I know, I can do more than cook."

215,Rachel,Mrs.
216,Rachel,What?
217,Rachel,"This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is notthat's-that's not what it is."
218,Rachel,"See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually."
219,Rachel,"It's-it's, they're-they're wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale's, so And obviously in uh, in-in this case,  I am going to report back, ""USA not ready."""
220,Rachel,Mrs.
221,Rachel,Yes!
222,Rachel,"Well, we were going to do that afterI mean umm, next."
223,Rachel,Mr.
224,Rachel,"Oh, yeah, well Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin' around the house."
225,Rachel,Mr.
226,Rachel,Yes.
227,Rachel,Mr.
228,Joey,"Dude, I am sorry about what I said!"
229,Chandler,"No, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name!"
230,Joey,It's not that bad.
231,Chandler,Yes it is!
232,Chandler,"From now on, I have no first name."
233,Joey,"So, you're just Bing?"
234,Chandler,I have no name.
235,Phoebe,"All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?"
236,Chandler,"Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint."
237,Joey,No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
238,Chandler,"Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?"
239,Phoebe,"Umm, Gene."
240,Chandler,It's Clint.
241,Chandler,It's Clint!
242,Joey,"See you later, Gene."
243,Phoebe,"Bye, Gene."
244,Chandler,It's Clint!
245,Chandler,Clint!
246,Joey,What's up with Gene?
247,Monica,"So, you wore your nightie to dinner?"
248,Rachel,"Oh, yeah."
249,Rachel,"And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out."
250,Phoebe,Oh my God!
251,Monica,"Oh, no!"
252,Rachel,"No, it's all right."
253,Rachel,I got nice boobs.
254,Ross,"So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!"
255,Rachel,So?
256,Ross,So!
257,Ross,Poetry?
258,Ross,Susan's gay!
259,Ross,They're being gay together!
260,Monica,Emily's straight.
261,Ross,"Oh, wake up!"
262,Phoebe,"Wow, Carol really messed you up!"
263,Ross,Excuse me?
264,Phoebe,"Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant."
265,Phoebe,"All right, so I don't know what sycophant means, but the rest is right."
266,Ross,"Look, I don't know what you're talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person."
267,Rachel,Huh.
268,Ross,What?
269,Rachel,She's totally right!
270,Rachel,"When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on."
271,Monica,This totally makes sense!
272,Ross,It does not!
273,Monica,"Oh, sure it does!"
274,Monica,"In high school, you weren't jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!"
275,Phoebe,"All right, all right, so up until 92-93 he was very trusting, then '94 hit, Carol left him and bamn!"
276,Phoebe,Paranoid city!
277,Rachel,Absolutely!
278,Rachel,Absolutely!
279,Monica,This is so much fun!
280,Ross,This is not fun!
281,Monica,"Look, all we're trying to say is, don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily."
282,Phoebe,Yeah.
283,Phoebe,The '92 Ross wouldn't.
284,Ross,"Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing."
285,Rachel,"Whatyeahwhat, y'know what?"
286,Rachel,I hope Emily is a lesbian.
287,Phoebe,Drum roll.
288,Chandler,Okay.
289,Chandler,Okay.
290,Chandler,All right.
291,Chandler,Help!
292,Chandler,"Am I a Mark, or a John?"
293,Joey,"Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney."
294,Chandler,"All right look, am I serious, okay?"
295,Chandler,Tomorrow at
296,Phoebe,You're actually going through with this?
297,Chandler,"Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life."
298,Chandler,"Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women So, as of 4 o'clock tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson."
299,Phoebe,You got problems because of you!
300,Phoebe,Not your name!
301,Phoebe,"All right, this has got to stop!"
302,Phoebe,Chandler is a great name!
303,Phoebe,"In factyes,  I'm, I'm sorry."
304,Phoebe,"I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I'm-I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna name the baby Chandler."
305,Chandler,Really?
306,Phoebe,"Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!"
307,Chandler,Okay.
308,Chandler,Thanks.
309,Phoebe,Okay!
310,Chandler,You wanna hug it out?
311,Phoebe,Yeah!
312,Phoebe,Yay!
313,Chandler,Yay!
314,Phoebe,Yayohyay!
315,Phoebe,"Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice!"
316,Phoebe,Right now!
317,Chandler,Okay!

3,Joey,All right.
4,Joey,I'll give you one hint.
5,Joey,Warren Beatty.
6,Joey,"Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem."
7,Joey,"See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy."
8,Chandler,'Cause he was just so darn cute.
9,Joey,"No, as part of the audition."
10,Joey,"See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses."
11,Ross,"Well, hey."
12,Ross,"You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it."
13,Ross,Or you just do it.
14,Joey,"I did do it, I'm a professional."
15,Monica,Then what's the problem?
16,Joey,"See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'."
17,Joey,"Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother."
18,Phoebe,"Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks."
19,Phoebe,What does Warren Beatty know about kissing  Ooh.
20,Phoebe,OPENING CREDITS
21,Chandler,"Hey, what did your agent say?"
22,Joey,"Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday."
23,Joey,"Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong."
24,Joey,"Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me."
25,Monica,"What, forget it!"
26,Rachel,"Yeah, right."

33,Phoebe,Okay.
34,Phoebe,"Good, very good, firm but tender."
35,Phoebe,I'd recommend you to a friend.
36,Joey,Then I don't know what it is.
37,Joey,What's the problem?
38,Monica,"Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on."
39,Joey,"Yeah, that makes sense."
40,Ross,Over my dead body!
41,Chandler,And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
42,Ross,"Come on out, honey!"
43,Ross,I'm telling you look good!
44,Ross,"Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good."
45,Phoebe,"Oh my God, you look so good!"
46,Rachel,I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.
47,Ross,"So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding."
48,Rachel,Because I promised Mindy I would.
49,Monica,"Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him."
50,Rachel,"Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor."
51,Rachel,And besides you know what I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.

117,Chandler,It means we're holding hands.
118,Phoebe,Are you the cutest?

120,Phoebe,"You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or."
121,Phoebe,It could be a guy.
122,Chandler,"Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her."
123,Phoebe,It could be like a big giant guy.
124,Joey,"Man, I got this close to him  and Monica kneed me in the back."
125,Joey,What's going on?
126,Phoebe,We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.
127,Joey,"Oh, well."
128,Joey,Just ask her how long she's gonna live.
129,Joey,Women live longer than men.
130,Chandler,How do you not fall down more?
131,Phoebe,"Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'"
132,Chandler,All right.
133,Chandler,"""My husband is sleeping with his secretary."""

140,Monica,"Oh, absolutely."
141,Monica,"Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about."
142,Ross,"Hey, there."
143,Rachel,Hi.

145,Rachel,"Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time."
146,Ross,"Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right."

156,Ross,"What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'"
157,Rachel,Oh my God this is sooo humiliating.
158,Rachel,"I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school."
159,Rachel,I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out.
160,Rachel,"Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes."
161,Ross,"Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad."
162,Rachel,"Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you."

184,Chandler,You're married that's what's wrong.
185,Phoebe,"Oh, my."

187,Phoebe,She wants to meet you in person.
188,Chandler,"Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband."
189,Phoebe,"What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy."
190,Phoebe,"I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip."
191,Chandler,"Okay, I'll do it!"
192,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah!"
193,Phoebe,Okay!

200,Monica,"Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will."
201,Monica,"You know what, maybe I don't need to have children."
202,Monica,"You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I..."
203,Monica,"I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do."
204,Monica,BEST
205,Rachel,What.
206,Rachel,BEST
207,Ross,"Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that..."
208,Rachel,"Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?"
209,Ross,"Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend."
210,Rachel,Oh dear God.
211,Ross,"Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight."
212,Ross,"And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis."
213,Ross,What are you doing I'm serious.
214,Ross,"Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me  Cheers."
215,Rachel,She you in the parking lot.
216,Ross,"No, Rach!"
217,Rachel,"Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave."
218,Rachel,"I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings ."
219,Rachel,"See now, tonight, all I  really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity."
220,Rachel,"Well , I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen."
221,Rachel,"There's nothing really left to say except.... ""Her name was Lola."
222,Rachel,She was a showgirl.
223,Rachel,"With yellow feathers , feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there."
224,Rachel,"She would..."""
225,Ross,"Marenge,"
226,Rachel,"""...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha."
227,Rachel,"And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar."
228,Rachel,"At the, wait, wait, everybody.."""

237,Monica,"Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say."
238,Monica,"I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one."

247,Phoebe,"Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door."
248,Phoebe,"It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil."
249,Phoebe,I think what you have to do is try not to...
250,Chandler,Oh my God!
251,Ross,"All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend."
252,Ross,"So just, just shut up and close your eyes ."
253,Joey,"Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it."
254,Joey,But that was a hell of a kiss.

10,Monica,"Oh, by the way."

12,Ross,"Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?"

22,Monica,Know what they'll say this year?
23,Monica,"""God, you"""
24,Joey,"Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying."

94,Rachel,"Yeah, if you're going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area."
95,Ross,"No, us having to lie about being married."
96,Rachel,"No, I know I don't either, but ya know what, it's their party, and it's just one night."
97,Rachel,And we don't even have to lie; we just won't say anything.

110,Phoebe,I'll go with you
111,Chandler,Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.
112,Joey,"I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don't want him complimenting my thing."
113,Ross,I'm so we weren't in the car!
114,Ross,Did he ever let up?
115,Monica,He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.
116,Ross,This room!
117,Ross,This night!
118,Ross,That waiter!
119,Ross,His shoes!
120,Ross,I must take a mental picture!
121,Ross,Ooh sorry
122,Phoebe,Were you guys making fun of Parker?
123,Ross,"That depends, how much did you hear?"
124,Phoebe,"So, he a little enthusiastic, what's wrong with that?"
125,Monica,"It's just that, it's so much."
126,Phoebe,"Well, so what I like him!"
127,Phoebe,Do I make fun of the people you've dated?
128,Phoebe,"Tag, Janice, Mona?"
129,Phoebe,"No, because friends don't do that."
130,Phoebe,"But, do you want my opinion?"
131,Phoebe,Do you want it?
132,Phoebe,"Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the who's who of human crap."
133,Monica,I feel terrible.
134,Joey,I know
135,Ross,What was wrong with Mona?
136,Ross,Commercial Break
137,Rachel,Open it!
138,Rachel,Open it!
139,Rachel,Open it!
140,Ross,Yeah baby!
141,Ross,"No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends."
142,Ross,It was a small wedding.
143,Rachel,But it was beautiful.
144,Rachel,"I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular."
145,Rachel,"On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang Isn't She Lovely as I walked down the aisle."
146,Rachel,"Yeah, Stevie's an old family friend."
147,Rachel,So would I.
148,Rachel,You wouldn't think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.
149,Ross,Would you excuse us for a second?
150,Ross,Umm.
151,Ross,what are you doing?
152,Rachel,What?
153,Rachel,I'm not you.
154,Rachel,This may be the only wedding I ever have.
155,Rachel,I want it to be amazing.
156,Ross,"Okay, okay."
157,Ross,"Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley."
158,Rachel,"Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic."
159,Phoebe,"No, I'm fine."
160,Phoebe,I'm great.
161,Phoebe,I'm with you.
162,Phoebe,"Hm huh, yeah."
163,Phoebe,"No, that's not necessary."
164,Phoebe,"No, actually I don't eat"
165,Phoebe,"Okay, fine!"
166,Phoebe,Fine!
167,Phoebe,Mmmhmmmmm.
168,Phoebe,Why don't you just try one?
169,Chandler,What are you doin'?
170,Monica,Just going over my toast.
171,Monica,Those two will never know what hit em.
172,Monica,I can't wait.
173,Monica,They're going to be crying so hard.
174,Monica,They're going to be fighting for breath.
175,Chandler,"Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could ."
176,Rachel,"And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns."
177,Rachel,"Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it."
178,Rachel,Aunt
179,Rachel,"Well, I don't know about that, but some said that I looked like a floating angel."
180,Rachel,Oh yeah.
181,Rachel,That's a great story.
182,Ross,"Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium."
183,Ross,That's-that's where we had our first date.
184,Ross,"Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower Aunt"
185,Rachel,Shhh!
186,Rachel,I want to hear the rest!
187,Ross,"Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down."
188,Ross,"And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words ""Will you marry me?"""
189,Rachel,"And the ring, was the size of my fist !"
190,Joey,"Yeah uh, Phoebe!"
191,Joey,"Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay?"
192,Joey,We were being jerks.
193,Joey,Parker's a nice guy and I'd like to get to know him.
194,Phoebe,Then you better do it now.
195,Joey,Why?
196,Phoebe,Because I'm going to kill him
197,Joey,What-what?
198,Phoebe,You guys were right.
199,Phoebe,He's just too excited abouteverything.
200,Phoebe,"I mean I'm all for living life, but this is the Geller's 35th anniversary."
201,Phoebe,Okay?
202,Phoebe,Let's call a spade a spade this party stinks.
203,Joey,I know I'm having the worst time.
204,Joey,"There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!"
205,Phoebe,Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?
206,Joey,"I guess it could've been, I didn't really look at it."
207,Joey,"Y'know, I just wiped it on Chandler's coat and got the hell out of there."
208,Phoebe,He's just such a great guy I'm so excited about him.
209,Joey,"Oh hey, you should be excited about him."
210,Joey,There's nothing wrong with him he's a good guy.
211,Phoebe,You think?
212,Joey,Yeah.
213,Joey,Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.
214,Phoebe,You're right.
215,Phoebe,"You're right, he's just embracing life."
216,Phoebe,We could all stand to be a little more like Parker.
217,Phoebe,You know what?
218,Phoebe,I am like him!
219,Phoebe,"I'm a sunny, positive person."
220,Joey,"Actually, you have a little bit of an edge."
221,Phoebe,What's that now?
222,Joey,Nothing
223,Phoebe,Oh look it's Parker!
224,Phoebe,Oooh I love it!
225,Phoebe,Are you kidding?
226,Phoebe,People acting like animals to music.
227,Phoebe,Come on!
228,Monica,Okay it's time for the toast!
229,Monica,"Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year I'm going to do it."
230,Monica,"No, no it's going to be great."
231,Monica,Really!
232,Monica,"Mom, Dad, when I got married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me."
233,Monica,For that and so many other things I want to say thank you.
234,Monica,"I know I probably don't say it enough, but I love you."
235,Monica,"When I look around this room, I'm-I'm saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us."
236,Monica,"Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she can't because she's dead."
237,Monica,As is our dog Chi-Chi.
238,Monica,I mean look how cute she is.
239,Monica,Was.
240,Monica,Do me a favor and pass this to my parents.
241,Monica,Remember she's dead.
242,Monica,"Okay, her and Nana, gone."
243,Monica,Wow!
244,Monica,Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in Terms of Endearment?
245,Monica,Didn't see that?
246,Monica,No movie fans?!
247,Monica,You want to hear something sad?
248,Monica,"The other day I was watching 60 Minutes these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love."
249,Monica,You people are made of stone!
250,Monica,Here's to mom and dad!
251,Monica,Whatever!
252,Monica,Mrs.
253,Ross,"Oh, no, Mom, it's just Monica this year."
254,Ross,Mrs.
255,Ross,"No, of course, Um Um, everybody?"
256,Ross,"Um, I-I just wanted to sayon behalf of my new bride, Rachel , and myself."
257,Ross,"Umm, that ifif in 35 years, we're half as happy as you guys are, we'll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world."
258,Ross,Mrs.
259,Phoebe,Can I get you something to drink?
260,Phoebe,Like a water and Valium?
261,Phoebe,Oh thank God.
262,Phoebe,Yeah?
263,Phoebe,I know!
264,Phoebe,I know!
265,Phoebe,Uh huh?
266,Phoebe,"Listen why don't we just um, sit and relax?"
267,Phoebe,You know just be with each other.
268,Phoebe,Quietly!
269,Phoebe,"Let's try something else, let's play a game."
270,Phoebe,Shocking!
271,Phoebe,Let's play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.
272,Phoebe,"But, let's play this one first."
273,Phoebe,And remember whoever talks first loses!
274,Phoebe,Oh my God!
275,Phoebe,Oh my God!
276,Phoebe,Wrong?
277,Phoebe,Really?
278,Phoebe,You know the word wrong.
279,Phoebe,Everything isn't perfect?
280,Phoebe,Everything isn't magical?
281,Phoebe,Everything isn't a glow with the light of a million fairies?
282,Phoebe,"They were just brake lights, Parker!"
283,Phoebe,You don't have to put a good spin on everything.
284,Phoebe,No!
285,Phoebe,I am a positive person.
286,Phoebe,"You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!"
287,Phoebe,Much less happy!
288,Phoebe,So long!
289,Phoebe,Don't let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out!
290,Phoebe,Uh huh.
291,Ross,"and then, we could've gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!"
292,Rachel,"Ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible."
293,Ross,But having a dove place the ring on your finger would've been no problem?
294,Rachel,It was really fun being married to you tonight.
295,Ross,Yeah!
296,Ross,And!
297,Ross,"And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I've ever made."
298,Rachel,"Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?"
299,Ross,Yeah.
300,Rachel,"That proposal, at the planetarium"
301,Ross,"I know, I know it was stupid."
302,Rachel,Are you kidding?!
303,Rachel,"With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars!"
304,Rachel,It wasreally wonderful!
305,Rachel,Did you just make that up?
306,Ross,"No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out."
307,Ross,"It's how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me."
308,Rachel,"Well, that would've been very hard to say no too."
309,Ross,"It's a good thing I didn't do it, because it sounds like it would've been a very expensive wedding."
310,Ross,"Okay, good night"
311,Rachel,Goodnight
312,Ross,Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn't get messed up?
313,Rachel,I will think about it.
314,Ross,That's all I'm askin'  Ending Credits
315,Monica,Okay that's it.
316,Monica,I give up.
317,Monica,"At mom and dad's 40th anniversary, you're the one giving the speech."
318,Ross,Y'know I don't understand why they didn't cry.
319,Ross,It was a beautiful speech.
320,Monica,"Oh, come on."
321,Ross,Hey!
322,Ross,"All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad!"
323,Ross,And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.
324,Ross,And what you said about Nana.
325,Ross,"Ohh, yeah she really would've wanted to be there."
326,Ross,And you know what?
327,Ross,I think she was.
328,Monica,"Oh good God, Ross!"

1,Chandler,You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?
2,Joey,Yeah!
3,Joey,Oh my God!
4,Joey,Is this what it's like to be you?
5,Monica,"Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?"
6,Joey,"Oh, you have no idea."
7,Joey,"And-and when we're on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart!"
8,Phoebe,"Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this!"
9,Ross,Hey!
10,Ross,"Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away."
11,Monica,Yes!!
12,Monica,Yes!
13,Monica,"Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
14,Ross,We were all pretty shaken up about it.
15,Phoebe,"Wait, am I missing something though?"
16,Phoebe,"Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way."
17,Ross,"Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person."
18,Monica,"Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch!"
19,Monica,And I'm sorry she died.
20,Monica,Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
21,Ross,You get the dollhouse.
22,Monica,I get the dollhouse!

24,Phoebe,"When I was kid, I had a barrel."
25,Joey,"Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?"
26,Phoebe,"No, just a barrel."
27,Monica,"Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse."
28,Phoebe,Really?!
29,Phoebe,Really?
30,Monica,Any time you want.
31,Monica,"Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!!"
32,Monica,"It was to be looked at, but never played with."
33,Chandler,My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
34,Chandler,Opening Credits
35,Rachel,"Hey, Sophie!"
36,Chandler,Hey.
37,Rachel,"Thanks for lunch, Chandler."

39,Chandler,"Oh, that's-that's okay, no problem."

68,Phoebe,Ha-ha.
69,Monica,What's this?
70,Phoebe,"That's a dog, every house should have a dog."
71,Monica,Not one that can pee on the roof.
72,Phoebe,"Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste."
73,Chandler,And is this in case the house sneezes?
74,Phoebe,"No, no, that's the ghost for the attic."
75,Monica,I don't want a ghost.
76,Phoebe,"Well, nobody wants a ghost."
77,Phoebe,"But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground."
78,Ross,"Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground?"
79,Ross,That would never happen.
80,Phoebe,"Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government."
81,Rachel,Hey!
82,Rachel,I need to talk to you!
83,Ross,"Sure, what's up?"
84,Rachel,"Oh, sorry."

106,Monica,"No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay?"
107,Monica,"They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go."
108,Phoebe,"Okay,  fine."

136,Rachel,What's this?
137,Phoebe,"The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture."

155,Chandler,"Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening."
156,Rachel,Hmm.
157,Chandler,"Of course, I didn't get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna's such a big, dull dud!"
158,Rachel,What?
159,Rachel,"Oh, I...."
160,Rachel,"Oh, I know..."
161,Joey,"Come on baby, don't go."

165,Joey,That guy's like a cartoon.
166,Joey,What do you see in him anyway?
167,Joey,"Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater!"
168,Joey,It's what's underneath her sweater that counts.
169,Joey,"And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I'm going out with?"
170,Joey,Do you want me to want you to care?

183,Joey,Okay.
184,Joey,"Ah, are you okay?"
185,Joey,I don't know.
186,Joey,How do you mean?
187,Joey,Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
188,Joey,"Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist."
189,Joey,"And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!"
190,Joey,Something like that?
191,Joey,Yeah.

206,Joey,Yep.
207,Joey,"I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out."
208,Joey,"And then I knew she was dreaming cause, cause her eyes keep going like this."
209,Chandler,"I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong."
210,Chandler,Okay?
211,Chandler,"All I said was, This was fun."
212,Chandler,Let's do it again sometime.
213,Chandler,I'll give you a call.'
214,Rachel,"Ohh, gee."
215,Rachel,I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
216,Chandler,That's what you say at the end of a date.
217,Rachel,"You can't just say, Nice to meet you, good night?'"
218,Chandler,To her face?
219,Chandler,"Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out."
220,Chandler,"I can't help it, it's a compulsion."
221,Monica,"Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call."
222,Monica,Hasn't it ever happened to you?
223,Rachel,"Well, they always called."
224,Monica,"Hmm, bite me."
225,Rachel,No.
226,Rachel,Sorry.
227,Rachel,"Okay, okay."

229,Rachel,Well...
230,Rachel,No.
231,Rachel,I...
232,Rachel,Call her!
233,Rachel,Call her now!
234,Chandler,"Multiple, so many paper cuts."
235,Rachel,Why hasn't he called Rachel?
236,Rachel,Why?
237,Rachel,Why?
238,Rachel,I don't understand.
239,Rachel,Why?
240,Rachel,He said he'll call.
241,Rachel,Why?
242,Rachel,Why?
243,Rachel,"Chandler I'm telling you she has flipped out, she's gone crazy!"
244,Chandler,"Oh, well give me the phone then."
245,Rachel,"Come on, this isn't funny."
246,Rachel,She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her.
247,Rachel,You have to call her!
248,Chandler,"Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'"
249,Rachel,Well then you're going to have to take her out again.
250,Chandler,Nooo!!
251,Chandler,She's really dull!
252,Chandler,And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
253,Rachel,I don't care!
254,Rachel,I don't care!
255,Rachel,"You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended."
256,Rachel,"And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!"
257,Chandler,All right!
258,Chandler,Fine!
259,Chandler,"But it's just a lunch date, no more than an hour!"
260,Chandler,"And from now on I get my own dates, I don't want you setting me up with anybody ever again!"
261,Rachel,That's fine!
262,Chandler,"That's just a lot of big talk, y'know."
263,Rachel,I know.
264,Ross,Mon?
265,Monica,I'm in the shower!
266,Ross,"Oh, fire!"
267,Ross,"There, there's a fire!"
268,Ross,Fire!

271,Joey,"Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?"
272,Joey,"Y'know, about what happened with us."
273,Joey,What are you talking about?
274,Joey,It was a big deal.
275,Joey,"I mean, come on you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you."
276,Joey,"I-I was there, you're not that good an actress."
277,Joey,Nooo.
278,Joey,"Hi, Lauren."
279,Ross,"Sorry I ah, I scared you in there."
280,Monica,"Oh, that's okay."
281,Monica,"By the way, I was just checking the shower massager."

293,Monica,"Well, the giraffe's okay."
294,Monica,And so is the pirate.
295,Phoebe,Ohh.
296,Phoebe,What is this?
297,Ross,"No Phoebe, don't look!"
298,Ross,You don't want to see what's under there!
299,Phoebe,"Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!"
300,Chandler,It's not a big deal.
301,Chandler,"It's, just it's right here,  and it's all the time."
302,Chandler,"Yes, this, this was pleasant."
303,Chandler,"The food there was, was great."
304,Chandler,So take care.
305,Chandler,"Well, this was great."
306,Chandler,I'll give you a call.
307,Chandler,We should do it again sometime.
308,Rachel,Sophie's desk.
