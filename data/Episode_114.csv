13,Joey,"Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain."
14,Chandler,Mine is the red one!
15,Chandler,Oh God.
16,Chandler,"Can open, worms everywhere."
17,Joey,"Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?"

67,Monica,"Until I do, I'm not telling them anything."
68,Ross,"I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind."
69,Ross,"Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'"
70,Ross,"Alright, shall we?"
71,Monica,"OK, wait, wait, wait, wait."

129,Phoebe,"I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?"
130,Rachel,What's 1922?
131,Phoebe,"Just, you know, long time ago."
132,Phoebe,"Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot."
133,Phoebe,"And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible."

154,Chandler,"Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings."
155,Chandler,You want it.
156,Joey,"Why would I want another apartment, huh?"
157,Joey,I've already got an apartment that I love.
158,Chandler,Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
159,Joey,"Alright, you want the truth?"
160,Joey,I'm thinkin' about it.
161,Chandler,What?
162,Joey,I'm sorry.
163,Joey,"I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore."
164,Chandler,"Woah, woah, woah."
165,Chandler,"I don't need a roommate either, OK?"
166,Chandler,I can afford to live here by myself.
167,Chandler,"Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware."
168,Joey,"What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh?"
169,Joey,It's not like we agreed to live together forever.
170,Joey,We're not Bert and Ernie.

172,Chandler,"If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it."
173,Joey,Well that's how I feel.
174,Chandler,Well then maybe you should take it.
175,Joey,Well then maybe I will.
176,Chandler,Fine with me.

246,Chandler,What?
247,Joey,"Well, I can't use these forever."
248,Joey,"I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment."
249,Chandler,"No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?"
250,Joey,I'm movin' out like we talked about.
251,Chandler,Well I didn't think that was serious.
