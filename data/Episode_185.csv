1,Joey,We are so in luck!
2,Joey,Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement.
3,Joey,Wait right there.
4,Chandler,"Oh no-no-no, I'm, I'm paddling away!"
5,Joey,Huh?
6,Chandler,Wow!
7,Chandler,Really?!
8,Chandler,We get all this rusty crap for free?
9,Joey,Uh-huh.
10,Joey,This and a bunch of bubble wrap.
11,Joey,"And, some of it is not even popped!"
12,Chandler,Could we be more white trash?
13,Chandler,Opening Credits
14,Monica,How desperate am I?
15,Rachel,Oh!
16,Rachel,"Good thing Chandler's not here, he always wins at this game."
17,Monica,I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
18,Phoebe,How come?
19,Monica,"Because I need the money, and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect."
20,Ross,"Come on, I think this is a good thing."
21,Ross,I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.
22,Monica,You don't have to stick up for her.
23,Monica,She can't here you.
24,Rachel,Hey!
25,Rachel,"Umm, do you guys have any juice?"
26,Joey,Just pickle.
27,Chandler,"Hey uh, Rach, funny story."
28,Chandler,"I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday."
29,Rachel,"My boss, Joanna?"
30,Rachel,"Wow, that must've been awkward."
31,Chandler,"Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink."
32,Rachel,"You ah, you didn't say Yes' to that did you?"
33,Chandler,No.
34,Chandler,No!
35,Chandler,"Well, not at first."
36,Rachel,What is she doing here?
37,Rachel,I don't understand!
38,Rachel,"Last time you went out with her you said she was a big, dull dud.'"
39,Chandler,"Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level."
40,Rachel,"Well, last time I almost got fired."
41,Rachel,"You must end it, you must end it now!"
42,Chandler,"Oh, come on!"
43,Chandler,It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me!
44,Chandler,I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself.
45,Rachel,Chandler!!
46,Rachel,"Promise me, you will end it."
47,Chandler,"Okay, I promise, I'll end it."
48,Rachel,Thank you.
49,Chandler,"I hope you know what I'm giving up for ya, because she's not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean."
50,Joey,Yeah-eh-eah!
51,Joey,"Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant."
52,Monica,"Doing great, the quiches are coming along."

55,Monica,Mrs.
56,Monica,Let me ask you a question.
57,Monica,Mrs.
58,Monica,Why did you hire me?
59,Monica,Mrs.
60,Monica,Oh my God!
61,Monica,Did you hear that?
62,Monica,She hired me because she thinks I'm good.
63,Phoebe,"Okay, I didn't hear that."
64,Monica,"Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I'm good."
65,Phoebe,Wow!
66,Phoebe,"And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian!"
67,Joey,Uhhhh.

72,Joey,The
73,Ross,I'm telling you it's totally unconstituional.
74,Ross,"Monica, Chandler, Phoebe, and"
75,Rachel,"Oh yeah, I totally agree."
76,Monica,I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.
77,Chandler,it was like the Algonquin kids table.
78,Chandler,The
79,Joey,Yeah-well-yeah!
80,Joey,Yeah-oh-yeah.
81,Joey,Come on in.
82,Phoebe,That's weird.
83,Monica,What?
84,Phoebe,Your nails.
85,Monica,"Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones."
86,Monica,I just did it so my Mom wouldn't give me grief about me biting them.
87,Phoebe,"Oh, no, I meant that it's weird that you only have nine now."
88,Monica,Oh my God.
89,Monica,"Wait a minute, I had them put  Oh my God!"
90,Monica,It's in the quiche!
91,Monica,Oh My God!
92,Phoebe,"Okay, don't panic."
93,Phoebe,"I'm gonna go to the store, I'm gonna get you another set of nails, no one's gonna know, and you're gonna look great."
94,Phoebe,Oh!
95,Phoebe,"Oh, it's cause they're gonna eatthat's the problem."
96,Phoebe,Mrs.
97,Monica,"Okay ah, please don't freak out."
98,Monica,"Umm, but ah, there's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there's no way to know which one."
99,Phoebe,And!
100,Phoebe,Whoever finds it wins the prize!
101,Phoebe,Mrs.
102,Monica,Then why are you laughing?
103,Monica,Mrs.
104,Monica,What?
105,Monica,You bet I'd lose a nail?
106,Monica,Mrs.
107,Monica,Frozen lasagnas?
108,Monica,Mrs.
109,Monica,You bet that I'd screw up?!
110,Monica,So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was Mrs.
111,Monica,"You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase."
112,Monica,Mrs.
113,Monica,That's right.
114,Monica,My Mom doesn't have any faith in me!
115,Monica,"Oh, that's hilarious!"
116,Monica,Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
117,Phoebe,I don't get it.
118,Phoebe,Mrs.
119,Monica,No!
120,Monica,You have lasagnas!
121,Phoebe,"Op, the ruined quiches are ready."
122,Chandler,It just doesn'tfeel like we're breaking up.
123,Chandler,Okay.
124,Chandler,"(They start kissing again, but are interrupted by the phone."
125,Chandler,Thanks.
126,Chandler,Okay.
127,Chandler,I'm getting dressed.

129,Chandler,What is it?
130,Chandler,"Ah-ha, you're not the boss of me."
131,Chandler,"Yeah, you are!"
132,Chandler,"Ooh, saucy."
133,Chandler,"You are, you're gonna leave me like this?"
134,Chandler,Okay.
135,Chandler,"But if you don't come back soon,  there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!"
136,Rachel,"That's weird, she locked the door."
137,Rachel,"Okay, swear you won't tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna's office."
138,Rachel,Do you wanna see the list?
139,Chandler,Hi!
140,Chandler,How are you?
141,Chandler,(Rachel and Sophie both back out and close the door without saying anything.
142,Chandler,Commercial Break

148,Chandler,What?
149,Rachel,What?
150,Chandler,"Rachel, could I see you for a moment?"
151,Chandler,"Okay, here's the situation."
152,Chandler,The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door.
153,Chandler,Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me?
154,Chandler,"And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit."
155,Rachel,You promised you would break up with her!
156,Chandler,I did break up with her!
157,Chandler,"She just took it really, really well!"
158,Rachel,And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?
159,Chandler,It did enter my mind!
160,Chandler,"But then something happened that made it, shoot right out."
161,Rachel,"Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them."
162,Chandler,No-no-no-no-no-no-no!!
163,Chandler,I can't get myself right out of them!
164,Chandler,You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!!
165,Chandler,"Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and"
166,Rachel,"Oh, Chandler!!"
167,Rachel,"All right, this is it!"
168,Rachel,You never see Joanna again!
169,Chandler,Never!
170,Rachel,You never come into this office again!
171,Chandler,Fine!
172,Rachel,You give me back my Walkman!

177,Chandler,Here we go!
178,Chandler,Come on!
179,Chandler,This is great!
180,Chandler,Ahhh!
181,Rachel,Does it hurt?
182,Chandler,"No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them."
183,Chandler,Hello sweet pants!
184,Rachel,Wait a minute!
185,Rachel,What are you gonna tell Joanna?
186,Chandler,About what?
187,Rachel,"When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I'm gonna get fired!"
188,Chandler,I'll make something up!
189,Chandler,"I'm good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!"
190,Rachel,"No, there's nothing to make up, she's gonna know that I have a key to her office, I've got to get you locked up back the way you were!"
191,Chandler,"Oh-ho-ho, I don't think so!"
192,Chandler,"Well, this is much better."

195,Joey,I'm out.
196,Joey,The

212,Monica,"Ohh, I'm such an idiot."
213,Monica,I can't believe I actually thought she could change.
214,Phoebe,"Well, who cares what your Mom thinks?"
215,Phoebe,So you pulled a Monica.
216,Monica,"Oh good, I'm glad that's catching on."
217,Phoebe,"No but, why does that have to be a bad thing."
218,Phoebe,Just change what it means.
219,Phoebe,Y'know?
220,Phoebe,Go down there and prove your Mother wrong.
221,Phoebe,"Finish the job you were hired to do, and we'll call that pulling a Monica."
222,Monica,What?
223,Phoebe,"Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A's, his parents would say, ""Yeah, he pulled a Monica."""
224,Phoebe,Y'know?
225,Phoebe,"Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, ""Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica."""
226,Phoebe,"Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, ""Yeah, that one's outta here."""
227,Phoebe,Though some things don't change.
228,Monica,"All right, I'll go down there."
229,Monica,"But, I'm not gonna serve the lasagna."
230,Monica,I'm gonna serve something I make.
231,Phoebe,Wow!
232,Phoebe,My breasts are really strong.
233,Rachel,Chandler!
234,Rachel,"Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she's very private about her office."
235,Rachel,Now I know why.
236,Chandler,"Hey, look, you're in trouble either way!"
237,Chandler,Okay?
238,Chandler,"If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she's gonna know you were in here."
239,Chandler,So you might as well just let me go.
240,Rachel,What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
241,Chandler,It still wouldn't be clean.
242,Chandler,All I want is my freedom.
243,Rachel,Foot rubs for a month!
244,Chandler,Freedom!
245,Rachel,I'll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!

264,Joey,The
265,Joey,"How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?"
266,Joey,The
267,Joey,You wanna see what I got?
268,Joey,Okay?

275,Joey,"Oh, I-I think I'm gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out."
276,Rachel,"I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts."
277,Chandler,No!
278,Rachel,I ah Oh!

288,Rachel,"Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know."
289,Chandler,How do Monica and Phoebe know?
290,Rachel,"Oh, I called them."
291,Rachel,"And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous  or very  stingy."
292,Chandler,Go on.
293,Rachel,I can make you a legend.
294,Rachel,I can make you this generation's Milton Berle.
295,Chandler,And Milton Berle has a
296,Rachel,"Ohh, not compared to you."
297,Monica,Well?
298,Phoebe,They're not even touching the lasagna!
299,Monica,Really?
300,Phoebe,"Oh, they love your casserole."
301,Monica,Yes!
302,Phoebe,It's hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
303,Phoebe,Mrs.
304,Monica,And you?
305,Monica,Mrs.
306,Monica,"So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success."
307,Monica,Which would make you Mrs.
308,Monica,"Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word."
309,Monica,Mrs.
310,Monica,Wow!
311,Phoebe,"Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica."
312,Phoebe,She doesn't know we switched it.
313,Phoebe,Mrs.
314,Monica,That really means a lot.
315,Monica,"Oh, and Mom, don't bite your nails."

324,Phoebe,The guys both lean back laughing.]
325,Joey,No he doesn't!
326,Chandler,"Two hours, that lasted!"
327,Rachel,So did you break up with Joanna?

329,Joey,"Well, it's good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius."
330,Ross,The volcano?
331,Joey,Yeah.
332,Joey,"And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation."
333,Rachel,What?
334,Joey,"Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant."
335,Monica,Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
336,Joey,"Well, we can talk about something else."
337,Joey,What do you want to talk about?
338,Joey,Vivisection?
339,Joey,The Vasdeferens?
340,Joey,The Vietnam War?
341,Monica,Oh!
342,Monica,Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?
343,Phoebe,"Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country."
344,Ross,With such a sad history.
345,Chandler,Could there be more Kims?
346,Chandler,Closing Credits
347,Rachel,It's me!
348,Rachel,Good morning!
