113,Chandler,Hi sweetie.
114,Chandler,"So, what was with all the whispering?"
115,Monica,I can't tell you.
116,Monica,It's a secret.
117,Chandler,Secret?
118,Chandler,Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another.
119,Chandler,We have too much love and respect for one another.
120,Monica,Awww.
121,Monica,But still no.
122,Chandler,"No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything."
123,Chandler,I do not have any secrets from you.
124,Monica,Really?
125,Monica,"Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?"
126,Chandler,"Oh no-no, I can't do that."
127,Monica,"If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said."
128,Chandler,Okay.
129,Monica,Okay.
130,Chandler,"So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos."
131,Chandler,"And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car."
132,Chandler,So Ross has about 10 tacos.
133,Chandler,"And anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy."
134,Monica,Oh my God.
135,Monica,He threw up?
136,Chandler,"No, he visited a little town south of throw up."
137,Chandler,So what was Phoebe's secret?
138,Monica,"Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired."
139,Chandler,That's it?!
140,Chandler,I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
141,Monica,That's right!
142,Monica,You lose sucker!!
143,Monica,Please still marry me.
144,Rachel,"Chandler, you have an assistant right?"
145,Chandler,Did she call?
146,Chandler,You-you told her I was sick right?
147,Chandler,Always tell her I am sick!
148,Rachel,"No, I-I just don't know how you decide who to hire."
149,Rachel,I mean I've got it narrowed down to two people.
150,Rachel,One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there's this guy
151,Chandler,What about him?
152,Rachel,I love him.
153,Rachel,He's so pretty I wanna cry!
154,Rachel,I don't know what to do.

156,Phoebe,Come on you know what to do!
157,Phoebe,You hire the first one!
158,Phoebe,"You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified."
159,Rachel,Uh-huh.
160,Rachel,"No, I hear what you're saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing?"
161,Rachel,Look how pretty!

163,Phoebe,Oh my God!
164,Phoebe,Oh But no!
165,Phoebe,No!

243,Ross,You told her!
244,Chandler,Nancy Thompson's getting fired!
245,Ross,"Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning!"
246,Ross,It's not like I choose to do it!
247,Ross,"It's not likeIt's not like I said, ""Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"""
248,Monica,You're right.
249,Monica,I mean I'm sorry.
250,Monica,"Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing."
251,Monica,I should be laying down papers for you!
252,Ross,How could you tell her?

263,Ross,"So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing."
264,Ross,"Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out withgirls."
265,Monica,You kissed a guy?!!
266,Monica,Oh my God.

327,Joey,"Today, I got nothin'!"
328,Rachel,"Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?"
329,Joey,"Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there."
330,Phoebe,What happened?
331,Joey,Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
332,Rachel,"Joey, why would you do that?"
333,Joey,Because they wanted me to audition!
334,Phoebe,You!
335,Phoebe,An actor?!
336,Phoebe,That's madness!

351,Phoebe,But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
352,Rachel,"Yes, I know that."
353,Rachel,I know that.
354,Rachel,And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I've ever done.
355,Rachel,"But I'm telling you, from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional."

388,Monica,Yeah?
389,Chandler,Yeah that was stupid.
390,Chandler,Let's not do that.
391,Monica,"Ohh, absolutely."
392,Ross,And!
393,Ross,"We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else."
394,Monica,"Yeah, definitely!"
395,Ross,"Okay,  if you'll excuse me, I-I'm gonna go hang out with some people who don't know the Space Mountain story."
