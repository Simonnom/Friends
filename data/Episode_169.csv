181,Monica,"Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!"
182,Phoebe,I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
183,Chandler,"Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing."
184,Chandler,You could get arrested.
185,Phoebe,"You could get arrested, right now!"
186,Phoebe,"All right, yeah, I gotta take it back."
187,Phoebe,I'm totally drunk with power.
188,Phoebe,Hey.

199,Chandler,You've been acting strange all day!
200,Joey,All right!
201,Joey,There is something.
202,Joey,"I kinda had a dream,  but I don't want to talk about it."
203,Chandler,Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that?
204,Chandler,I kinda have a dream!
205,Chandler,I don't want to talk about it.
206,Joey,"Well, it involved Monica."
207,Chandler,You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?!
208,Chandler,"Oh, that is so cool!"
209,Chandler,I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing.
210,Chandler,Anyway we're talking about your dream.
211,Chandler,I love you.
212,Chandler,Your dream?
213,Joey,"Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything."
214,Joey,I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.
215,Monica,What was the dream about?
216,Joey,"Well, okay."
217,Joey,You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle.
218,Joey,Y'know like you guys were doing last night.
219,Joey,"So, that's it."
220,Joey,I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
221,Monica,"Wait, Joey!"
222,Monica,Joey!
223,Monica,That doesn't mean that-that you're in love with me!
224,Joey,It-it doesn't?
225,Monica,No!
226,Chandler,"No, it can mean anything."
227,Chandler,"Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud."
228,Joey,That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
229,Monica,"Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too."
230,Joey,In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
231,Monica,Um-hmm.
232,Chandler,"Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica?"
233,Chandler,"Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?"
234,Joey,Not really.
235,Chandler,Well there you have it!
236,Monica,Well sure!
237,Monica,I'm just wearing sweats!
238,Monica,"But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!"
239,Joey,"No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend."
240,Joey,Y'know?
241,Joey,"I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend!"
242,Joey,"Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?"
243,Chandler,"Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating."
244,Chandler,So maybe-maybe that's it?
245,Joey,Friends first?
246,Joey,That's interesting.
247,Monica,You become friends after?
248,Joey,"No, never done that either."
249,Rachel,"Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?"
250,Chandler,"Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom."
251,Monica,That's right.
252,Rachel,What's up Joey?
253,Joey,How you doin'?
254,Joey,Commercial Break
255,Phoebe,"Excuse me, is this your car?"
256,Phoebe,"Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance."
257,Phoebe,"Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop."
258,Phoebe,"Ohh, no."
259,Phoebe,"Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too."
260,Phoebe,"So, all right, keep up the good work."
261,Phoebe,10-4.
262,Phoebe,"I-I'm with the umm, the 57th."
263,Phoebe,I'm in vice.
264,Phoebe,"Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now."
265,Phoebe,I'm a whore.
266,Phoebe,"Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?"
267,Phoebe,"Yeah, big guy, kinda bald."
268,Phoebe,"Don't try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out."
269,Phoebe,"His umm, his partner just died."
270,Phoebe,"I-I sure will, take care."
271,Phoebe,Oh.
272,Rachel,Hey!
273,Rachel,"Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?"
274,Joey,"Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class."
275,Joey,But y'know what?
276,Joey,"I guess I can blow that off,  for you."
277,Rachel,Thanks!
278,Joey,"Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something."
279,Joey,"Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight."
280,Rachel,I know.
281,Joey,Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there.
282,Joey,I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
283,Rachel,What's up Joe?
284,Joey,"Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great"
285,Rachel,Yeah?
286,Joey,is because they were friends first.
287,Joey,Y'know?
288,Joey,"So I asked myself, ""Who are my friends?"""
289,Joey,"You and Phoebe, and I saw you first."
290,Joey,So
291,Rachel,What are you saying?
292,Joey,I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
293,Rachel,"Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up."
294,Joey,I'll treat you real nice.
295,Rachel,"Yeah, well, y'know ummÂ… No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date."
296,Rachel,Don't hit on your existing friends!
297,Joey,Won't-won't that take longer?
298,Rachel,Yeah.
299,Rachel,Yeah.
300,Rachel,"Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait."
301,Joey,Yeah.
302,Joey,I understand.
303,Joey,I understand.
304,Joey,"Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!"
305,Ross,Come here to me.
306,Ross,"No-no, you come here to me."
307,Rachel,Hey Ross!
308,Rachel,I brought reinforcements.
309,Ross,Oh great!
310,Ross,"What, you brought Joey?"
311,Rachel,"Well, I brought the next best thing."
312,Chandler,Hey!
313,Ross,Chandler?!
314,Ross,You brought Chandler?!
315,Ross,The next best thing would be Monica!
316,Chandler,"Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so"
317,Ross,"Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it."
318,Ross,"Okay Rach,  that's you."
319,Ross,That's the couch.
320,Rachel,"Whoa-oh, what's-what's that?"
321,Ross,"Oh, that's me."
322,Rachel,Wow!
323,Rachel,You certainly think a lot of yourself.
324,Ross,No!
325,Ross,That's-that's my arm!
326,Chandler,"Oh, I see."
327,Chandler,"I thought you just really, really liked your new couch."
328,Ross,Y'know what?
329,Ross,Just-just follow my lead.

331,Chandler,Okay.
332,Ross,"Come on, Chandler."

339,Ross,Turn!
340,Ross,Turn!
341,Chandler,"Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!"
342,Rachel,"Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit."
343,Ross,Oh yeah it will!
344,Ross,"Come on, up!"
345,Ross,Up-up-up!
346,Ross,Up!
347,Ross,Yes!

355,Chandler,Shut up!
356,Chandler,Shut up!
357,Chandler,Shut up!
358,Ross,"Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore."
359,Ross,Chandler and
360,Rachel,You think?
361,Ross,"All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again."
362,Chandler,"Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now."
363,Ross,I can't believe that didn't work!
364,Rachel,"I know, me neither!"
365,Rachel,"I mean, you had a sketch!"
366,Chandler,"Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?"
367,Joey,Hey!
368,Rachel,Hey!
369,Rachel,How's it going?
370,Rachel,Did you make any new friends?
371,Joey,"Yeah, yeah, I met this woman."
372,Chandler,"Hey, whoa-whoa!"
373,Chandler,What's she like?
374,Joey,"Uhh, well, she'sÂ…really good in bed."
375,Monica,"Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!"
376,Joey,"Well look, hey, it's all your fault!"
377,Rachel,What?!
378,Rachel,Why?
379,Joey,Well because you didn't give me advice!
380,Joey,No!
381,Joey,You gave me a pickup line!
382,Joey,"As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first."
383,Joey,"I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her!"
384,Joey,And her roommate!
385,Monica,What about the closeness?
386,Joey,Closeness-shmoshness!
387,Joey,There was three of us for crying out loud!
388,Joey,All right!
389,Joey,"Hey, who wants pizza?"
390,Chandler,"Ooh, I do!"
391,Chandler,I do!
392,Chandler,I do!

398,Phoebe,"Ooh, God, it's him!"
399,Phoebe,It's that cop!
400,Phoebe,"God, I can't believe it!"
401,Phoebe,He found me!
402,Rachel,"Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?"
403,Phoebe,"Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you  with me."
404,Phoebe,Harboring a fugitive?
405,Phoebe,That's one to three years minimum.
406,Phoebe,Good luck Chandler.
407,Phoebe,"Okay, you can arrest me."
408,Phoebe,Fine.
409,Phoebe,But you'll never make it stick and you know it!
410,Phoebe,Yep!
411,Phoebe,As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool.
412,Phoebe,A fool!
413,Phoebe,I would love it if I weren't here!
414,Phoebe,Me?
415,Joey,Nice!
416,Phoebe,Wow!
