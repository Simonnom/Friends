0,Joey,"Okay, pick a card."
1,Chandler,Okay.
2,Joey,"All right now, memorize it."
3,Joey,You got it?
4,Chandler,Oh yes.
5,Joey,Is that your card?
6,Chandler,Yes.
7,Ross,Hi!
8,Chandler,Hi there!
9,Phoebe,What are you talking about?
10,Ross,"Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning."
11,Joey,Whoa!
12,Joey,This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town!
13,Joey,Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!!
14,Joey,"I mean, way to go Ben!"
15,Joey,Man!
16,Joey,I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.
17,Ross,"I know, it's crazy!"
18,Ross,We were just pushing Ben on the swings
19,Joey,I'm always on the swings!
20,Joey,What am I doing wrong?
21,Chandler,That.
22,Chandler,Opening Credits
23,Rachel,"Okay, gotta go!"
24,Rachel,Wish me luck!
25,Joey,Luck!
26,Chandler,"Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?"
27,Rachel,"Uh well, y'know what?"
28,Rachel,I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day
29,Chandler,"Unwilling to steal from work, interesting."
30,Monica,"Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me."
31,Rachel,"Okay guys, way to wish me luck!"
32,Phoebe,"Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday."
33,Phoebe,I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
34,Joey,"Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month."
35,Phoebe,"Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise."
36,Monica,I think it's a great idea.
37,Monica,"Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends."
38,Joey,Ross!!
39,Joey,We're having a surprise party for Rachel!
40,Ross,Okay!
41,Joey,Done.
42,Phoebe,"Okay, great so do you want to do it together?"
43,Monica,I would love to do it together!
44,Joey,They're gonna do it together.
45,Chandler,Dude!
46,Chandler,That's my girlfriend!
47,Joey,"What, so I gotta shut it down now?"
48,Ross,"All right, I gotta take off."
49,Ross,I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.
50,Monica,It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
51,Ross,Yeah.
52,Chandler,Weirder than watching his two moms make out?
53,Joey,Whoa-whoa dad?
54,Joey,There's a dad in the commercial?
55,Ross,Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
56,Joey,"Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad."
57,Joey,I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
58,Ross,You're not his godfather.
59,Joey,What?!
60,Joey,Are you kidding?
61,Ross,Of course I am!
62,Ross,"Okay, let's go godfather."
63,Joey,All right!
64,Joey,Hey!
65,Joey,"I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!"
66,Ross,Really?
67,Ross,That's great!
68,Joey,I know!
69,Joey,I know!
70,Joey,"It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her"
71,Joey,"Oh yeah, yeah!"
72,Joey,He's done tons of commercials.
73,Joey,"I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company."
74,Joey,"In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies."
75,Joey,Chandler was mad.
76,Ross,"Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one."
77,Ross,Ben is way cuter than that kid.
78,Ross,"I mean look at him, look at you,"
79,Joey,That's great.
80,Joey,"Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?"
81,Ross,"Joey, you look nothing like Ben."
82,Joey,I look more like him than you do!
83,Rachel,"Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric  Sorry."
84,Rachel,"Oh, what a fun office."
85,Rachel,"Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror storiesabout ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke."
86,Rachel,and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
87,Monica,That doesn't seem fair.
88,Rachel,I know!
89,Rachel,"It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!"
90,Chandler,"Yeah, it is the best."
91,Rachel,I mean what if this keeps happening?
92,Rachel,"Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know?"
93,Rachel,"And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick?"
94,Rachel,Me or Smokey Smokerson?
95,Monica,"Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke."
96,Monica,Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
97,Rachel,"Yeah, I can do that."
98,Chandler,"Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke."
99,Phoebe,Hey!
100,Monica,Hey!
101,Phoebe,"Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?"
102,Rachel,I would love to!
103,Phoebe,Oh good!
104,Chandler,"Yeah, I wanna go to babe."
105,Phoebe,Oh good.
106,Phoebe,"Oh wait, I change my mind!"
107,Phoebe,"Okay, let's talk about the party!"
108,Phoebe,I have so many ideas!
109,Monica,"Yeah, me too!"
110,Phoebe,"Oh, look at that."
111,Monica,"All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs!"
112,Monica,I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
113,Phoebe,What happened to the intimate dinner party?
114,Monica,"Oh, we're not doing that."
115,Monica,Okay
116,Phoebe,"So wow, it looks like you took care of everything."
117,Phoebe,"Thanks a lot, co-host."
118,Monica,What?!
119,Monica,"I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!"
120,Phoebe,Like what?
121,Monica,Cups.
122,Phoebe,Cups?
123,Phoebe,You're giving me cups?
124,Monica,And ice!
125,Phoebe,Cups and ice?
126,Phoebe,"Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice?"
127,Phoebe,All right.
128,Phoebe,"Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!"
129,Monica,"Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant"
130,Phoebe,I got it!
131,Phoebe,Mine!
132,Ross,Hi.
133,Monica,Hey!
134,Monica,How'd the audition go?
135,Ross,Not so good.
136,Monica,"Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's  ""Audition didn't go so well."
137,Monica,"Yeah it did?"""
138,Ross,Yeah I am!
139,Ross,"Yeah, Ben got a second audition!"
140,Joey,"Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback."
141,Monica,You got a callback too didn't you?
142,Joey,Yeah I did!
143,Rachel,"Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air."
144,Rachel,Oh great!
145,Rachel,Oh that's okay.
146,Rachel,"Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those?"
147,Rachel,"Y'know what, actually  Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?"
148,Rachel,"Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know?"
149,Rachel,"Y'know what I mean, like dubbies?"
150,Rachel,"And I actually, I thought to myself, ""Wow, those guys are crazy!"""
151,Rachel,"But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time."
152,Rachel,"Oh, me too."
153,Rachel,"Oh, me too."
154,Ross,"Oh God, this is so nerve wracking!"
155,Ross,How-how do you do this?
156,Joey,"Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so"
157,Joey,Who knows?
158,Joey,The Casting
159,Ross,Yes!!
160,Ross,I knew it!!
161,Ross,Bye-bye!
162,Ross,So long!
163,Ross,Later!
164,Joey,Oh this is great!
165,Joey,I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
166,Ross,Yeah!
167,Ross,The Casting
168,Joey,"Man, this is gonna be kinda weird."
169,Ross,"Yeah, it is."
170,Ross,"No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird."
171,Phoebe,Hey!
172,Phoebe,Ross and
173,Chandler,Hi!
174,Phoebe,Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
175,Chandler,Ah sure.
176,Chandler,What's in 'em?
177,Phoebe,"Umm, cups."
178,Chandler,"Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water."
179,Ross,Seriously that's a lot of cups.
180,Phoebe,"Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice."
181,Chandler,Y'know I rued the day oncedidn't get a whole lot else done.
182,Phoebe,"Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups."
183,Phoebe,"Oh, hi Joey!"
184,Joey,Hey Pheebs!
185,Joey,Hey!
186,Ross,Hey!
187,Joey,"Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here."
188,Joey,I wanna talk to you about something.
189,Ross,What's up?
190,Joey,"Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good."
191,Joey,"So, I think I'm just gonna step aside."
192,Joey,I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
193,Ross,"Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great."
194,Ross,Thanks man.
195,Joey,That's it?
196,Joey,You're-you're gonna let me do this?!
197,Joey,This-this is my career we're talking about here!
198,Ross,"Well, you just"
199,Joey,I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it!
200,Joey,"Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!"
201,Ross,What?
202,Joey,What?
203,Joey,Chandler!
204,Joey,Tell 'em!
205,Chandler,"Well I mean, let me get the door first."
206,Chandler,"Oh, hi!"
207,Chandler,No one.
208,Ross,Why should Ben step aside?
209,Ross,It was his audition in the first place!
210,Ross,You-you just tagged along!
211,Ross,"You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad."
212,Joey,At least I care about his feelings!
213,Ross,What?
214,Joey,Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn't get it?
215,Ross,And why wouldn't he get it?
216,Joey,"Oh, come on!"
217,Joey,Have you seen what my kid can do?!
218,Joey,Huh?!
219,Joey,I mean he dials phones!
220,Joey,He-he-he eats tortilla chips!
221,Joey,He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
222,Ross,Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
223,Joey,You just give him a spoon baby!
224,Ross,Oh yeah?
225,Ross,I guess we'll just see!
226,Joey,Yeah!
227,Joey,Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
228,Ross,You're kid's name is Raymond!
229,Joey,Yeah?!
230,Joey,So's yours!
231,Monica,How did work go?
232,Rachel,Oh it was great!
233,Rachel,It was great!
234,Rachel,"I went down there just like you said, y'know?"
235,Rachel,And we talked business.
236,Rachel,Kim totally took my opinions.
237,Monica,You stink!
238,Rachel,Thanks!
239,Monica,"No, I'm-I'm serious!"
240,Rachel,Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking.
241,Rachel,This is actually the smell of success.
242,Chandler,"Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God!"
243,Chandler,You smoked!
244,Rachel,I did not!
245,Chandler,Yes you did!
246,Chandler,You look happy and sick; you smoked!
247,Rachel,"All right, fine!"
248,Rachel,But I had too!
249,Rachel,I had to do it for my career!
250,Chandler,I wish I had smoked for my career
251,Monica,That's so gross!
252,Rachel,"No well, no it's not that bad, y'know?"
253,Rachel,"I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up."
254,Chandler,"Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!"
255,Monica,Chandler!
256,Monica,"I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up."
257,Monica,I'm not kidding.
258,Chandler,I think you smell great!
259,Rachel,I am so on board!
260,Rachel,"Yeah, I did, but y'know what?"
261,Rachel,"I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know?"
262,Rachel,"Good luck, Rach."
263,Rachel,Well then let's just quit!
264,Rachel,We'll just quit!
265,Rachel,Let's all quit!
266,Rachel,Oh but you could.
267,Rachel,You can.
268,Rachel,Absolutely!
269,Rachel,We can help each other out!
270,Rachel,We can get--what are those--those patches!
271,Rachel,We could be like the Patch Sisters!
272,Rachel,Yes!
273,Rachel,Great!

281,Joey,"Oh yeah, no problem."
282,Joey,Hi Ben!
283,Joey,So you wanna be an actor huh?
284,Joey,"I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic."
285,Joey,There's tons of rejection.
286,Joey,No stability.
287,Joey,"One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle."
288,Ross,Joey!
289,Joey,Ross!

385,Joey,Yeah?
386,Joey,"Well look Ross, you don't have to."
387,Joey,Okay?
388,Joey,It's not your fault I suck.
389,Joey,"I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, ""Hmm, noodle soup."""
390,Ross,Yeah y'know what?
391,Ross,"Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson."
392,Joey,What you do mean?
393,Ross,"I think, sub-consciously"
394,Joey,"Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me."
395,Ross,"I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part."
396,Joey,"Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine."
397,Joey,Yeah.
398,Joey,Yeah!
399,Joey,It's not that I'm a bad actor
400,Ross,No!
401,Joey,"No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed."
402,Ross,There you go.
403,Ross,Thank you!
404,Joey,Thank you!
405,Joey,"So, did-did he get it?"
406,Ross,No.
