32,Monica,"Ok.  Hey, why don't you ask Richard?"
33,Joey,"Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?"

35,Monica,"I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game?"
36,Monica,What?
37,Joey,I don't know.
38,Monica,C'mon.
39,Monica,Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.
40,Chandler,"I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old  -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings."
41,Monica,"So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me."
42,Monica,"Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag."

44,Chandler,"Ok, this could be tough."
45,Joey,"Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar."
46,Chandler,"Ooh, you almost had it."
47,Ross,"No no, you're fine, you're fine."

51,Ross,He pulled himself up.
52,Ross,Standing man.
53,Ross,I'm sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it.
54,Ross,I don't believe this.
55,Ross,"I miss, I miss the first time of everything."
56,Ross,"I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled."
57,Ross,What else did I miss?
58,Ross,"Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?"
59,Ross,"Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff."

72,Monica,"Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay."
73,Phoebe,"Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness."
74,Phoebe,"You know, before she killed herself."
75,Chandler,Hey.
76,Joey,Hey.
77,Rachel,Hey.

79,Monica,"Where is he, where's Richard?"

82,Joey,"What's the matter with you, he's parking the car."
83,Monica,So'd you guys have fun?
84,Chandler,Your boyfriend is so cool.
85,Monica,Really?
86,Chandler,"Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar."
87,Chandler,"Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15."
88,Rachel,"Wow, he must like you the best."
89,Joey,"Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats."
90,Joey,"You never even saw the money, it was like this."
91,Joey,"Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats ."
92,Chandler,You're welcome.
93,Chandler,"Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car ."

101,Joey,He kept my dollar.
102,Monica,"So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?"
103,Ross,"Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg."

106,Ross,Have a good time.
107,Ross,"Ok, Ben."
108,Monica,Ross.
109,Ross,Yeah.
110,Monica,Look.
111,Monica,"Joey, do you know we can see you from here?"
112,Joey,How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
113,Ross,"Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula."
114,Monica,"You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard."
115,Joey,"Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him."
116,Ross,Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
117,Chandler,"Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know."
118,Monica,"So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?"
119,Joey,Oh we flipped for it.
120,Joey,"I got the cigar, he got the moustache."
121,Joey,"Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks."
122,Ross,"Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine."
123,Chandler,"Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs."
124,Monica,You're meeting Richard?
125,Joey,"Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game."
126,Chandler,"Yeah, didn't he tell ya?"
127,Monica,"Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys."
128,Chandler,You hear that?
129,Chandler,We're the guys.
130,Joey,We're the guys.
131,Monica,With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?
132,Ross,Thank you.
133,Ross,"Hi, we're visitiing."
134,Ross,It's Ben and his da-da.
135,Ross,Da-da.
136,Ross,Can you say da-da?
137,Ross,"Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try."
138,Rachel,No luck huh?
139,Ross,Naa.
140,Ross,"A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off."
141,Rachel,"Oh, yeah sure, Ok."
142,Ross,What're you doing?
143,Rachel,"Uh, I'm holding Ben."
144,Ross,"Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb."
145,Rachel,Ok.
146,Ross,Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.
147,Rachel,This is how I would hold a football.
148,Ross,"Ok, here, here."
149,Ross,There we go.
150,Rachel,"Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies."
151,Rachel,"I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one."
152,Ross,"It's alright, it's no big deal."
153,Rachel,Really?
154,Ross,"Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby."
155,Rachel,What?
156,Ross,What?
157,Rachel,You think about stuff like that?
158,Ross,"Uhh, yeah."
159,Ross,"I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies."
160,Rachel,"Two, two babies?"
161,Ross,Yeah.
162,Ross,"Ya know, a boy and a girl."
163,Ross,Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.
164,Rachel,Then what's gonna happen?
165,Ross,"Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale."
166,Rachel,Uh-huh.
167,Ross,"Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want."
168,Ross,"And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great."
169,Rachel,Wow.
170,Rachel,"Wow, that's great."
171,Rachel,Great.
172,Rachel,"Ok, wow, you know what."
173,Ross,Huh?
174,Rachel,"I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this  and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee."
175,Rachel,"Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot."
176,Rachel,I don't have a pot.
177,Rachel,"Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale."
178,Rachel,Hey is that a door?
179,Phoebe,Hey.
180,Phoebe,"Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes."
181,Monica,So you watched the movies huh?
182,Phoebe,"Uh huh, what is happening to the world?"
183,Phoebe,"I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies."
184,Phoebe,"With the web, the spider she dies, she does."
185,Phoebe,She has babies and dies.
186,Phoebe,"It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud."
187,Monica,"Alright, you wanna feel better?"
188,Phoebe,Yeah.
189,Monica,"Ok, here, watch this."
190,Phoebe,It's a Wonderful Life.
191,Phoebe,Yes I've heard of this.
192,Monica,"So you can't lose, it's there in the title."
193,Monica,Wonderfullness is baked right in.
194,Phoebe,"Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease."
195,Phoebe,"Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity."
196,Chandler,"Hey, big guy, game time."
197,Monica,There's a game?
198,Chandler,"Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop."
199,Chandler,Bring your nerves of steel.
200,Monica,"Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other."
201,Monica,"Alright that's great, then just go."
202,Monica,Go Knicks.
203,Monica,"Oh, then go Vassar."
204,Monica,"Ok, then just go."
205,Monica,"Oh, why does this bother me so much?"
206,Monica,I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.
207,Phoebe,Sure.
208,Monica,"It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?"
209,Phoebe,Does it matter?
210,Phoebe,You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.
211,Rachel,Aghh.
212,Phoebe,Me too.
213,Monica,I've got a question.
214,Monica,Richard made plans again with the guys.
215,Rachel,"Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century."
216,Monica,"Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there."
217,Monica,"Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles."
218,Ross,"Ok, what the hell happened back there?"
219,Rachel,"I don't know, you tell me."
220,Rachel,"One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes."
221,Ross,"Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff."
222,Ross,"Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders."
223,Rachel,"Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks."
224,Ross,"C'mon, what, you never think about our future?"
225,Rachel,"Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night."
226,Rachel,I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be.
227,Rachel,You know what our childrens names are gonna be.
228,Ross,"No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good."
229,Rachel,What was the book?
230,Ross,The big book of childrens' names.
231,Rachel,"Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing."
232,Ross,Yeah.
233,Rachel,But I do not want to have everything decided for me.
234,Rachel,I spent my whole life like that.
235,Rachel,"It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left."
236,Rachel,"I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that."
237,Ross,Ok fine.
238,Rachel,Thank you.
239,Ross,We're not done.
240,Rachel,I didn't know that.
241,Ross,"Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that."
242,Rachel,"Fine, I will."
243,Ross,"Good, 'cause I love you."
244,Rachel,Oh yeah.
245,Ross,Yeah.
246,Rachel,Well I love you too.
247,Ross,Well that's the first time we've said that.
248,Rachel,Yes it is.
249,Ross,"Well, I'm gonna kiss you."
250,Rachel,Well you better.
251,Phoebe,Hey.
252,Phoebe,Oh thanks for the great movie tip.
253,Monica,Did you like it?
254,Phoebe,Oh yeah.
255,Phoebe,"You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed."
256,Monica,"Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?"
257,Phoebe,"I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed."
258,Phoebe,"It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, ""It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."""
259,Chandler,Kick save and... denied.
260,Joey,Man you are incredible.
261,Chandler,"Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's."
262,Monica,Honey.
263,Monica,"Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table."
264,Monica,Score!
265,Monica,Now can we go?
266,Chandler,"See, that's why we don't let her play."
267,Monica,Um-hmm.
268,Chandler,"Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault."
269,Chandler,I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.
270,Joey,"Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with."
271,Joey,"No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this."
272,Joey,He is so much cooler than our dads.
273,Joey,"I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow."
274,Joey,What are you kickin me for?
275,Joey,Huh?
276,Joey,I'm tryin to talk here.
277,Joey,Oh yeah.
278,Chandler,No.
279,Joey,Nooooo.
280,Chandler,"Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular."
281,Chandler,"See, when we say dad, we mean buddy."
282,Chandler,We mean pal.
283,Chandler,"No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad."
284,Chandler,I've even got some dads down at work.
285,Monica,Nighty-nite.
286,Chandler,You're not a dad.
287,Chandler,You're not a dad.
288,Joey,Not a dad.
289,Chandler,I can't believe you got us into trouble.
290,Monica,So are you ok?
291,Monica,Come here.
292,Monica,I'll make you feel like one of the guys.
293,Monica,"You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball."
294,Monica,"Yeah, well they suck too."
295,Ross,"Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail."
296,Rachel,"Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter."
297,Ross,Hello.
298,Ross,Come on up.
299,Ross,I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together.
300,Rachel,"Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben?"
301,Rachel,"Yes we can, yes we can."
302,Rachel,There.
303,Rachel,I did it.
304,Rachel,I did it.
305,Rachel,"Look at that, oh, stays on and everything."
306,Rachel,Hi.
307,Rachel,"I'm sorry, what did you just say?"
308,Rachel,Did you just say hi?
309,Rachel,"Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said 'Hi'."
310,Ross,"Wha, what?"
311,Rachel,Ben just said hi.
312,Ross,"What, the word hi?"
313,Rachel,"Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi."
314,Ross,"Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything."
315,Rachel,"Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him."
316,Rachel,CAROL and
317,Rachel,Guess what.
318,Rachel,Ben just said his first word.
319,Ross,Something about hi.
320,Rachel,"You know, actually it's more like, hi."
321,Rachel,Hi.
322,Rachel,Hi.
323,Rachel,Hi.

332,Rachel,He said bye.
333,Rachel,"You said, you said bye to me."
334,Rachel,You said bye to me.
335,Ross,"Alright, alright, ok. Bye."
336,Ross,Bye.
337,Ross,Bye.
338,Ross,Bye.
339,Ross,CLOSING CREDITS
340,Phoebe,"Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him."
341,Phoebe,"Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again."
342,Phoebe,"But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it."
343,Phoebe,"And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so."
344,Phoebe,"Ok, here we go."
345,Phoebe,"Oh, I'm so glad you're here."
346,Phoebe,END
