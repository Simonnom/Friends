41,Rachel,"No, one of them..."
42,Monica,Which one?
43,Rachel,"I don't know, what were the names I just said?"
44,Monica,"Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated."
45,Rachel,"All right, all right, you're right, I won't do anything with Joey, I just thought that we  Ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion?"
46,Monica,What the hell are you cooking!
47,Monica,Opening credits
48,Ross,Hey!
49,Monica,Hey!
50,Chandler,Hey!
51,Ross,"Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today."
52,Chandler,"Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs."
53,Ross,There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.
54,Monica,What's so bad about that?
55,Ross,It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
56,Ross,These aren't suede.
57,Ross,Charlie
58,Ross,"Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller."
59,Ross,"Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice."
60,Ross,"Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out."
61,Monica,Is he gonna introduce us?
62,Chandler,"No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now."
63,Ross,"Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute."
64,Monica,Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
65,Ross,"We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover."
66,Ross,I don't think so.
67,Ross,"Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is ""if you can't come on time, then don't come at all""."
68,Ross,An option that many of my students use.
69,Ross,Shall we?
70,Ross,"You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?"
71,Ross,Professor
72,Ross,"Oh, damn it!"
73,Joey,Hey!
74,Rachel,Hey!
75,Joey,What's happenin'?
76,Rachel,"Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight."

81,Joey,Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.
82,Rachel,And you weren't going to tell us?
83,Rachel,How did you think you were gonna get away with that?
84,Joey,I do it every year.
85,Rachel,You do that every year?
86,Joey,I didn't have to tell you that!!
87,Joey,I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!
88,Rachel,"Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us?"
89,Joey,Yeah...
90,Rachel,And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?
91,Joey,Yeah...
92,Rachel,OH!
93,Rachel,"And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?"
94,Joey,I can't believe you guys went for that one!
95,Rachel,"Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?"
96,Joey,"You're fine, ok?"
97,Joey,But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!

120,Ross,What?
121,Ross,"Oh... ok, fine."

132,Phoebe,"Ah, ah."

135,Monica,"So, did you two have fun?"

144,Ross,Really?
145,Ross,Wh-what's wrong?
146,Rachel,I don't know!
147,Rachel,I think it's kind of serious!
148,Rachel,"Oh, you know..."
149,Rachel,I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!
150,Rachel,"... Ok, who is this?"
151,Ross,"I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue."
152,Rachel,"Oh, hi!"

174,Phoebe,Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?
175,Rachel,"Yeah, and he does it every year!"

201,Phoebe,Where is Chandler anyway?
202,Monica,Oh my God!

204,Chandler,Where the hell is everybody?
205,Chandler,Bitter

220,Monica,Please... Chandler is the love of my life... ... oooh leather pants!
221,Monica,Have Mercy!
222,Monica,Ross
223,Ross,Ooh... so sad...
224,Ross,"Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard?"
225,Ross,Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?
226,Ross,You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?
227,Ross,... And you called him Alby!?
228,Ross,I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...
229,Ross,"Eh, you think?"
230,Ross,"I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!"
231,Ross,Oh!
232,Ross,like what?!
233,Ross,"Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch ""Access Hollywood""."
234,Ross,Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?
235,Ross,Two?
236,Ross,Wha...?
237,Ross,Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart
238,Ross,Oh my God!
239,Ross,Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?
240,Ross,Oh yeah?
241,Ross,"no, no Nobel Prizes for him?"
242,Ross,Huh... huh... what a loser!
243,Ross,Some more wine?
244,Phoebe,Hey Ross!
245,Rachel,How is it going with Charlie?
246,Ross,Oh Great!
247,Ross,After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh.
248,Ross,average-sized brains out.
249,Phoebe,"Oh, What's the matter?"
250,Ross,She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners.
251,Ross,"Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth."
252,Rachel,I always loved that!
253,Ross,"Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!!"
254,Ross,"Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league!"
255,Ross,oh my God!
256,Phoebe,Worse?
257,Ross,"Oh much, much worse."
258,Ross,"I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians...  ""Can we walk""?"
259,Ross,"Oh, you... you like that?"
260,Phoebe,No.
261,Ross,What?
262,Rachel,Come on!
263,Rachel,I think this is funny!
264,Chandler,"oh yes, God yes!!"
265,Chandler,Bitter
266,Chandler,I...
267,Chandler,I don't know... you seem lovely.
268,Joey,"Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk."
269,Joey,"Dirk, this is my good friend Ross."
270,Ross,Nice to meet you.
271,Ross,"Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology."
272,Ross,Joey
273,Ross,"Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys."
274,Ross,I'd lead with that.
275,Ross,Monica
276,Joey,Monica!
277,Monica,"Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!"
278,Monica,Joey
279,Ross,Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
280,Joey,"Ah, let me see!"
281,Joey,"Damn, that's a lot of guys!"
282,Joey,Are you a little slutty?
283,Rachel,I think I am.
284,Joey,Let me see if I approve any of these clowns.
285,Joey,This guy wears a rug .
286,Joey,This guy's Canadian .
287,Joey,"And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different."
288,Joey,Joey
289,Rachel,"Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?"
290,Joey,"Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best."
291,Rachel,"Joey, you're so sweet."
292,Joey,That's true.
293,Joey,"But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight."
294,Rachel,Who ?
295,Rachel,Joey
296,Rachel,What?
297,Rachel,Really?
298,Joey,"Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!"
299,Rachel,Oh!
300,Rachel,"Screw it, I didn't get it!"
301,Joey,Gotcha.
302,Rachel,"Oh, Very funny... Joey."
303,Rachel,Chandler
304,Monica,"Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry."
305,Chandler,Well you should be.
306,Chandler,You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
307,Monica,You really liked it?
308,Chandler,Oh yeah!
309,Chandler,"I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained  not to listen!"
310,Chandler,But after chapter
311,Monica,Oh really!
312,Chandler,"Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman!"
313,Chandler,"Tell me, tell me about your first period!"
314,Monica,No!
315,Chandler,Did somebody sign your bra?
316,Monica,So I got it when I was 13...
317,Phoebe,Hey Ross!
318,Phoebe,"So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off?"
319,Phoebe,"What is that, come on, a piece of paper?"
320,Ross,"It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize."
321,Phoebe,Go Charlie!
322,Phoebe,"But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them."
323,Phoebe,"Maybe she's looking to, you know,  slum it with some average Joe Phd."
324,Ross,"Yeah, maybe."
325,Ross,I do have my whole career in front of me.
326,Ross,"I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize."
327,Ross,Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.
328,Phoebe,You're so much more than just brains!
329,Phoebe,"You're sweet, and kind, and funny..."
330,Ross,And sexy.
331,Phoebe,Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
332,Ross,"Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her."
333,Phoebe,Good for you!
334,Phoebe,"And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!"
335,Ross,Stop going through my stuff !
336,Ross,Rachel
337,Monica,Hey!
338,Rachel,I just wanted to let you know I've changed my
339,Monica,"No, you can't!"
340,Monica,Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
341,Rachel,"Please, what about you and Chandler?"
342,Monica,That's different!
343,Monica,I was drunk and stupid!
344,Rachel,Well hello !
345,Monica,What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from?
346,Monica,Why don't you just kiss one of them?
347,Rachel,"I could, I could but I don't want to!"
348,Rachel,I want to kiss Joey!
349,Monica,Alright .
350,Monica,I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
351,Rachel,I'm gonna do it.
352,Monica,And I can't stop you.
353,Rachel,No.
354,Rachel,Ross
355,Phoebe,"Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler."
356,Chandler,"Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you."
357,Monica,"Oh, you're so wonderful."
358,Monica,Bitter
359,Chandler,"Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death ."
