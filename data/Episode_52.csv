6,Joey,Do we have to know about that?
7,Monica,"Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?"
8,Joey,"I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars."
9,Chandler,"Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's."
10,Ross,"God, I don't believe this."
11,Ross,She could be giving birth in the cab.
12,Rachel,"Oh, Ross, relax."
13,Rachel,"It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction."
14,Rachel,"What, it's ok when Chandler does it?"
15,Chandler,You have to pick your moments.
16,Phoebe,"Did I miss it, did I miss it?"

48,Monica,Come on.
49,Monica,Let's get some coffee.
50,Chandler,"Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that."
51,Joey,Shoot!

67,Joey,"Hey, we need a father over here!"
68,Joey,We need a father!
69,Joey,"Oh, oh, oh, sorry."
70,Joey,"Oh, uh, ok."
71,Joey,Right this way.
72,Joey,All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here.
73,Phoebe,"They're tiny and chubby and so sweet to touch,     and soon they'll grow up and resent you so much."
74,Phoebe,"Now they're yelling at you and you don't know why,      you cry and you cry and you cry."
75,Phoebe,And you cry and you cry and you cry...
76,Phoebe,"Thanks, Ross."
77,Ross,Yeah.
78,Ross,I'm paying you to stop.
79,Phoebe,Ok.
80,Phoebe,"Oh, look, twins."
81,Phoebe,"Hi, guys."
82,Phoebe,"Oh, cute, cute."
83,Monica,No fair.

86,Chandler,You'll get one.
87,Monica,Oh yeah?
88,Monica,When?
89,Chandler,All right.
90,Chandler,I'll tell you what.
91,Chandler,"When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?"
92,Monica,Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
93,Chandler,"Oh, no, no."
94,Chandler,I just meant hypothetically.
95,Monica,"Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?"
96,Chandler,"No, no, no."
97,Monica,What is it?
98,Monica,Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
99,Chandler,"Uh, uh."
100,Monica,Well?
101,Chandler,Dear God!
102,Chandler,This parachute is a knapsack!
103,Rachel,Hey.
104,Phoebe,Hey.
105,Phoebe,"Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress."
106,Monica,Did you go home and change?
107,Rachel,"Yeah, well, it's an important day."
108,Rachel,I wanna look nice.
109,Rachel,"Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?"
110,Monica,"No, I haven't seen him."
111,Rachel,"Well, where is he?"
112,Rachel,He is supposed to be here.
113,Rachel,What if the baby needs him?
114,Chandler,"Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway?"
115,Chandler,"Was, like, your father a doctor?"
116,Rachel,"Yeah, why?"
117,Chandler,No reason.
118,Joey,Tribbiani.
119,Joey,"Hi, yeah, it's me."

122,Joey,25.
123,Joey,An actor.
124,Joey,Hello?
125,Joey,"Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?"
126,Joey,"Ok, look, maybe I should just go."
127,Joey,"Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?"
128,Joey,You know what the Celtics problem is?
129,Joey,They let the players run the team.
130,Joey,"Oh, it is."
131,Joey,It is.
132,Ross,Breathe.
133,Ross,Breathe.
134,Ross,Breathe.
135,Ross,"15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12..."
136,Ross,Who the hell is Jordie?
137,Ross,No-no-no.
138,Ross,I don't have a son named Jordie.
139,Ross,"We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie."
140,Ross,What?
141,Ross,"Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie?"
142,Ross,We never landed on Jordie.
143,Ross,"We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco."
144,Ross,I got it.
145,Ross,I got it!
146,Ross,"Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps."
147,Ross,Why?
148,Ross,"No, you started it."
149,Ross,But...
150,Ross,Thanks a lot.
151,Ross,"Yeah, listen..."
152,Joey,Ew!
153,Joey,What is that?
154,Joey,Something exploded!
155,Joey,"Water breaking, what do you mean?"
156,Joey,"What's that, water breaking?"
157,Ross,Please.
158,Ross,This is so your fault.
159,Ross,"Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along."
160,Ross,You tryin' to be clever?
161,Ross,A funny lady?
162,Ross,"Oh, I'm threatened by you?"
163,Phoebe,"Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it!"
164,Phoebe,Get in here.
165,Phoebe,Come on.
166,Phoebe,"My god, you guys, I don't believe you."
167,Phoebe,There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing.
168,Phoebe,"So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!"
169,Ross,"Yeah, Susan."
170,Phoebe,"Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this."
171,Phoebe,"Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?"
172,Phoebe,Commercial Break
173,Ross,I'm having a baby in here!
174,Ross,"Ok, everyone stand back."
175,Ross,Ow.
176,Rachel,"No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?"
177,Rachel,Ok?
178,Rachel,"Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating."
179,Rachel,Dr.
180,Joey,"Come on, Lydia, you can do it."
181,Joey,Push!
182,Joey,"Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder."
183,Joey,"Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out!"
184,Joey,"Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho."
185,Joey,"Let's  I was justyeah, right."
186,Joey,Push!
187,Joey,Push!
188,Ross,Help!
189,Ross,Help!
190,Phoebe,"They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next... la la la la la la."
191,Phoebe,Susan and
192,Ross,Help!
193,Monica,"Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really."
194,Monica,"Yeah, Ross is great."
195,Monica,"He's uh, he's in a whole other place."
196,Monica,"No, he's gone."
197,Monica,"No no, you don't have to fly back, really."
198,Monica,What do you mean this might be your only chance?
199,Monica,Would you stop?
200,Monica,"I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet."
201,Chandler,Where have you been?
202,Joey,"Oh, just had a baby."
203,Chandler,Mazel tov!
204,Rachel,"No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not."
205,Rachel,Are you?
206,Rachel,Dr.
207,Rachel,"Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors."
208,Rachel,Dr.
209,Rachel,Oh.
210,Rachel,Dr.
211,Rachel,I'm a waitress.
212,Rachel,Dr.
213,Rachel,Yeah.
214,Rachel,Gotcha.
215,Rachel,Dr.
216,Rachel,Ok. That's fine.
217,Ross,"Come on, come on."
218,Ross,"Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit."
219,Ross,This is all your fault.
220,Ross,"This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know?"
221,Ross,"My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you."
222,Ross,"No no no, believe me."
223,Ross,"No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok?"
224,Ross,And you know what the funny thing is?
225,Ross,"When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok?"
226,Ross,Where does that leave me?
227,Ross,Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
228,Phoebe,This is so great.
229,Ross,You wanna explain that?
230,Phoebe,"I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one."
231,Phoebe,And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most.
232,Phoebe,And it's not even born yet.
233,Phoebe,"It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world."
234,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, you were fighting."
235,Monica,I'm sure they'll be here soon.
236,Rachel,"Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this."
237,Joey,Relax.
238,Joey,You're only at nine centimeters.
239,Joey,And the baby's at zero station.
240,Chandler,You are really frightening me.
241,Chandler,"Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart."
242,Chandler,"Uh, that's great."
243,Chandler,Anybody seen a nipple?
244,Chandler,Dr.
245,Ross,"Ok, got the vent open."
246,Phoebe,"Hi, I'm Ben."
247,Phoebe,I'm hospital worker Ben.
248,Phoebe,It's Ben... to the rescue!
249,Ross,"Ben, you ready?"
250,Ross,"All right, gimme your foot."
251,Ross,"Ok, on three, Ben."
252,Ross,"One, two, three."
253,Ross,"Ok, That's it, Ben."
254,Phoebe,"Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent."
255,Phoebe,Wait.
256,Phoebe,"Yes, it is in fact a dark vent."
257,Ross,"Phoebs, It's open!"
258,Ross,It's open!
259,Ross,We're here!
260,Ross,"Long story, honey."
261,Ross,Dr.
262,Chandler,"Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?"
263,Ross,"Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see."
264,Ross,"Oh, a head."
265,Ross,"Oh, it's, it's huge."
266,Ross,"Carol, how are you doing this?"
267,Ross,Hello!
268,Ross,"Oh, sorry."
269,Ross,"We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach."
270,Ross,"It's a boy, definitely a boy!"
271,Ross,All right!
272,Ross,"Ok, legs, knees, and feet."
273,Ross,"Oh, oh."
274,Ross,He's here.
275,Ross,He's a person.
276,Ross,"Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o."
277,Phoebe,"You guys, he's beautiful!"
278,Ross,"Oh, thanks, Pheebs!"
279,Ross,How 'bout Ben?
280,Ross,"We uh, we just cooked it up."
281,Monica,Hi.
282,Ross,Hey.
283,Monica,Can we come in?
284,Ross,"I know, I know."
285,Ross,"Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet."
286,Ross,Yeah.
287,Ross,This is Ben.
288,Ross,"Ben, this is everybody."
289,Phoebe,"Susan, he looks just like you."
290,Rachel,"Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these."
291,Chandler,"I know, I still am one of these."
292,Monica,"Ross, can I?"
293,Ross,"The head, the head."
294,Ross,You gotta...
295,Monica,"Hi, Ben."
296,Monica,Hi.
297,Monica,I'm your Aunt Monica.
298,Monica,Yes I am.
299,Monica,I'm your Aunt Monica.
300,Monica,I...I will always have gum.
301,Monica,Closing Credits
302,Ross,"Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this."
303,Ross,"But I'll still always come back, like this."
304,Ross,"And sometimes I may be away longer, like this."
305,Ross,"But I'll still always come back, like this."
306,Chandler,"And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this."
307,Monica,He is so amazing.
308,Rachel,"Oh, I know."
309,Rachel,Look at him.
310,Joey,"Ben, Ben, hey Ben."
311,Joey,Nothing.
312,Joey,I don't think that's his name.
313,Phoebe,"Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes."
314,Phoebe,"Look, he's opening his eyes."
315,Joey,"He doesn't do much, does he?"
316,Ross,"No, this is pretty much it."
317,Rachel,You guys wanna get some coffee?
318,Ross,"All right, I'll see you guys later."
319,Phoebe,"Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again."
320,Phoebe,End
