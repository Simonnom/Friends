0,Monica,"It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night?"
1,Monica,I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
2,Ross,"Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok?"
3,Ross,But SURPRISE!
4,Chandler,"I missed most of the party  Charlie's a girl, right?"
5,Ross,"Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did    not kiss."
6,Rachel,I don't know why Joey had to kiss her!
7,Rachel,"I mean, of all the girls    at the party, GOD!"
8,Ross,Why do you care so much?
9,Monica,"Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?"
10,Rachel,Be-cause Ross is the father of my child!
11,Rachel,You know...    and I... want him to hook up with lots of women!
12,Rachel,I just... All I'm saying    is...
13,Rachel,I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.
14,Ross,"Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each    other's tonsils..."
15,Phoebe,"Wow, Joey and a professor!"
16,Phoebe,"Can you imagine if they had kids    and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh,    those nerds will get laaaaaid!"
17,Rachel,"All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this?"
18,Rachel,I mean...
19,Ross,"Yeah, it's no big deal."
20,Ross,"I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with    it..."
21,Ross,"Oh, God."
22,Ross,I forgot how hot she was!
23,Joey,Hey!
24,Ross,I'm gonna get some more coffee.
25,Ross,Ok.
26,Chandler,"So, a professor, uh?"
27,Joey,Yeah!
28,Joey,"She is cool, and she's so smart!"
29,Joey,Her mind is totally acrimonious    .
30,Joey,That's not    how she used it...?
31,Ross,Uhm no!
32,Ross,Think less of you!
33,Ross,"No, I don't think less of you."
34,Ross,"I mean,    you saw someone you liked and you kissed them."
35,Ross,"I mean, those people who like    someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people."
36,Ross,"Yeah, I know the type."
37,Joey,"Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious."
38,Joey,No?
39,Joey,Am I getting close?
40,Joey,Opening credits
41,Phoebe,Hey!
42,Monica,Hey!
43,Phoebe,Hey you guys!
44,Phoebe,Look what I just got.
45,Rachel,"Oh, OH!"
46,Rachel,"Wow, I love those!"
47,Rachel,Where did you get them?
48,Phoebe,I bought them off Ebay!
49,Phoebe,They used to belong to the late Shania    Twain.
50,Rachel,"Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!"
51,Phoebe,Oh... then I overpaid.
52,Monica,"Hey, what's this?"
53,Rachel,"Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO."
54,Monica,"Oh, you can't show Phoebe this!"
55,Monica,She hates those corporate massage    chains.
56,Rachel,"Ah, why, now I can't get a massage?"
57,Rachel,There are so many things    that she disapproves of!
58,Rachel,"I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting..."
59,Monica,Do you wanna go hunting?
60,Rachel,"Well, I would like to have the option!"
61,Phoebe,What's up?
62,Phoebe,"Hey, Rachel!"
63,Rachel,Oh!
64,Phoebe,"No, you can't go there!"
65,Phoebe,"You know how I feel about these ""big    massage places""!"
66,Phoebe,They're putting people like me out of business!
67,Monica,"And she wants to go hunting, too!"
68,Rachel,"Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it!"
69,Rachel,It would be like throwing    away a hundred bucks!
70,Phoebe,"Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok?"
71,Phoebe,It's about... it's    about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.
72,Rachel,I don't care about any of that!
73,Phoebe,"Well, do you care about friendship?"
74,Rachel,Oh!
75,Phoebe,"I feel really strongly about this, Rachel."
76,Phoebe,"Please, don't use    this gift certificate."
77,Phoebe,I'm asking you as a friend.
78,Rachel,"Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!!"
79,Rachel,"Fine, I won't use it!"
80,Phoebe,Promise?
81,Rachel,I promise.
82,Phoebe,Thank you.
83,Rachel,But I am going hunting!
84,Monica,Hey honey!
85,Monica,I missed you today!
86,Chandler,"Oh, yeah?"
87,Monica,Yeah.
88,Monica,What d'you wanna do tonight?
89,Chandler,"Oh, well... Maybe we could..."
90,Monica,"Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess?"
91,Monica,Know your audience!
92,Monica,"Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need    to keep your tadpoles in the tank."
93,Chandler,We really need to take those tests?
94,Monica,"Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year."
95,Monica,I think    it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.
96,Chandler,But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
97,Monica,What is the big deal?
98,Chandler,It's weird!
99,Chandler,In a doctor's office?
100,Monica,It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do    it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?
101,Chandler,I cannot believe Ross told you that!
102,Chandler,"And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!"
103,Monica,"Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think    it's a good idea!"
104,Chandler,"Yeah, ok."
105,Chandler,I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than    on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!
106,Monica,OH!
107,Chandler,"Oh, yeah!"
108,Chandler,RACHEL TALKS TOO!
109,Joey,Who says that wine has to cost    more than milk!
110,Joey,Heeey!
111,Joey,"Come on in, how are ya?"
112,Joey,Can I offer you a drink?
113,Joey,Uh-oh.
114,Joey,"I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to    open a door and go  ohhhh!"
115,Joey,"Hey, if you need a tour guide..."
116,Joey,"Yeah, definitely, definitely."
117,Joey,"Ok, what do you wanna see first?"
118,Joey,Ok!
119,Joey,"I know, yeah!"
120,Joey,"Ok, let me stop you right there."
121,Joey,"The Mets suck, ok?"
122,Joey,You wanna    see the Yankees.
123,Joey,"Which one, they all suck!"
124,Joey,I don't think so.
125,Rachel,Hi there!
126,Rachel,"Oh, hi."
127,Rachel,"I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and    here is my gift certificate."
128,Rachel,And... taped back together.
129,Rachel,Ok
130,Rachel,through the glass doors.
131,Rachel,Alright-y then.
132,Phoebe,Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around?
133,Phoebe,"Oh, no, no!"
134,Phoebe,"Listen, is there someone    who can fill in for me?"
135,Phoebe,But that woman can't know I work    here.
136,Phoebe,She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this    massage chains are.
137,Phoebe,'Cause it's good money!
138,Phoebe,But that doesn't change the fact that    this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
139,Phoebe,"Ok, are they listening?"
140,Joey,Ross!
141,Ross,Hi!
142,Joey,I need to talk to you about Charlie.
143,Ross,"Oh, do you, do you really?"
144,Joey,"Yeah, I'm..."
145,Joey,I'm kind of having a little problem.
146,Ross,"Look, if you don't know what the word ""acrimonious""    means, just don't use it!"
147,Joey,"No, look, you know Charlie, right?"
148,Joey,"She's cool, she's funny, her    body is soo..."
149,Ross,Get to the problem!
150,Joey,Yes.
151,Joey,It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've    ever dated!
152,Joey,Combined!
153,Joey,I don't want her to think I'm stupid!
154,Ross,Are you wearing two belts?
155,Joey,"EH, what do you know!"
156,Ross,You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.
157,Joey,"Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural    places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff."
158,Joey,You gotta help me out!
159,Ross,"You know, I really don't want to    get involved in you guy's relationship."
160,Joey,"Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really    like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her."
161,Ross,Fine.
162,Joey,Thanks.
163,Ross,Ok. Let's see.
164,Ross,"Oh, you should take her to the MET!"
165,Joey,The Metsss!
166,Ross,"Oh, no!"
167,Ross,The MET!
168,Ross,The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
169,Joey,"Oh, that's what she meant!"
170,Joey,"You know, if they're    gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE!"
171,Joey,"You know, short for museum,    and avoid all the confusion!"
172,Ross,"Yeah, most of it it's a place  packed with confused angry    baseball fans!"
173,Joey,"Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET."
174,Ross,"Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore    on Madison Avenue."
175,Ross,You know what?
176,Ross,"She loves architecture,    you know what you should do?"
177,Ross,You should take a walk down fifth to the    Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that    she'd love.
178,Joey,"Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!"
179,Ross,But I'm not!
180,Ross,You know what if you're in the mood for    Thai food...
181,Joey,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
182,Joey,"Slow down, you go way too    fast."
183,Joey,Ok?
184,Joey,"Just go back to the MET, ok?"
185,Ross,Ok.
186,Joey,You got to tell me exactly what to do there.
187,Ross,"Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities    wing."
188,Ross,"Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire."
189,Joey,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
190,Joey,"So, I walk in the door and make    the right"
191,Chandler,I have a weird feeling about this place.
192,Chandler,How do I    know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
193,Monica,"Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody    is gonna wanna watch that."
194,Chandler,Deposit my specimen?
195,Chandler,"You know,    usually I have to call a  900 number for that kind    of talk."
196,Chandler,"Thanks, got it."
197,Monica,"Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going    to be ok?"
198,Chandler,"Yeah, I guess!"
199,Monica,"I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares!"
200,Monica,No one here even    knows you!
201,Chandler,"Oh, Come on!"
202,Chandler,Commercial Break
203,Monica,"Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!"
204,Chandler,Why are you here?
205,Chandler,No no no...
206,Chandler,"I mean, why?"
207,Chandler,why is    she here?
208,Chandler,What!
209,Monica,This was fun!
210,Monica,But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!
211,Chandler,"I'd love to stay, but I have eh...  got    a hot date..."
212,Chandler,I think it just fell off.
213,Phoebe,"Hello ""ja"", it's time    for your massage, ja!"
214,Phoebe,Put your face in the hole.
215,Rachel,"Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person."
216,Phoebe,"Okay, then I'm Swedish..."
217,Monica,"So, what's your name?"
218,Phoebe,It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...
219,Rachel,Oh... what an interesting name.
220,Phoebe,Ja!
221,Rachel,You know I...
222,Phoebe,Time for your scalp massage!
223,Rachel,Wow...
224,Rachel,I really love    your...
225,Phoebe,Is something wrong?
226,Rachel,"No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea...     Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?"
227,Phoebe,Uhm... Stockholm.
228,Rachel,Damn!
229,Rachel,I wish I knew if that was right!
230,Joey,Note the painterly    lines and subtle impasto on this canvas.
231,Joey,Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors    as his elusive subject was light itself.
232,Ross,"Now, do you have any idea what you just said?"
233,Joey,(shaking his head as if to
234,Ross,"Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt    M-O-N-A-Y."
235,Ross,I just...
236,Ross,I wrote that out phonetically for you.
237,Joey,Phonetically?
238,Ross,"Yeah, yeah that means... you know?"
239,Ross,We just... we don't have time    for this.
240,Joey,Ok.
241,Ross,"Ok, but you know what?"
242,Ross,"I gotta say,    I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!"
243,Joey,Ah!
244,Joey,I'm an actor!
245,Joey,I can memorize anything!
246,Joey,"Last week on ""Days""    I had to say ""Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy""."
247,Ross,Wow.
248,Ross,What does that mean?
249,Joey,No idea!
250,Joey,"But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I    guess it means ""you're gonna get eaten by a bear""."
251,Ross,Ok!
252,Ross,So let's move on to the Renaissance?
253,Joey,"Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish    of the central figure."
254,Joey,"Touch it, it's really bumpy!"
255,Ross,Nah ah!
256,Ross,Nah ah!
257,Ross,No no no!
258,Ross,"No ad-libbing    and dude, you can't touch the paintings."
259,Joey,Come on!
260,Joey,you...
261,Ross,No!
262,Chandler,My specimen is in the    room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.
263,Chandler,Really helped speed the process along!
264,Chandler,Janice!
265,Chandler,You're not... gone?
266,Chandler,Yeah!
267,Chandler,yeah...
268,Chandler,The hard part is over!
269,Chandler,I haven't...
270,Chandler,I haven't even thought about the results yet...
271,Chandler,I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
272,Chandler,"Yeah, but what if it's not?"
273,Chandler,What if there    is a reason why we can't have a baby?
274,Chandler,"oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks."
275,Chandler,I can't believe    I didn't even think of that.
276,Chandler,I guess I was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... 'that'...
277,Chandler,"It was a ""Wendy's!!    """
278,Phoebe,"""Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! """
279,Phoebe,And that is    the Swedish National Anthem!
280,Phoebe,Thank you for asking!
281,Rachel,"Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture."
282,Rachel,"Uhm, you know what?"
283,Rachel,I have    a friend who is a masseuse.
284,Phoebe,"Oh, Ja!"
285,Phoebe,Ja!
286,Rachel,Yah!
287,Rachel,She's... uhm... not very good though...
288,Phoebe,"Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?"
289,Rachel,I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy    fingers from playing crummy guitar...
290,Phoebe,Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're    such a high maintenance tight ass!
291,Rachel,Phoebe!
292,Phoebe,You know it's me?
293,Rachel,For like a half an hour!
294,Rachel,"Man, you can lie about Sweden!"
295,Phoebe,How can you come here?
296,Rachel,How could you not tell me you worked here?
297,Phoebe,I don't have to tell you everything!
298,Rachel,"Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting    a free massage!"
299,Phoebe,Tips not included.
300,Rachel,Oh!
301,Rachel,"Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?"
302,Phoebe,Because I was ashamed ok?
303,Phoebe,I sold out for the cash!
304,Phoebe,"And then    they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K."
305,Phoebe,But you know...    you pay a price.
306,Phoebe,Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh!
307,Phoebe,paying taxes!
308,Rachel,"Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there    right now and quit!"
309,Rachel,Be true to what you believe in!
310,Rachel,"Honey, you have principles    and I so admire that!"
311,Rachel,I don't have any!
312,Phoebe,You know what?
313,Phoebe,You are right.
314,Phoebe,I am gonna quit.
315,Phoebe,It's time    I took my life back!
316,Rachel,Good for you Pheebs!
317,Phoebe,Ok.
318,Phoebe,"Okay  If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any    of that."
319,Phoebe,I love you.
320,Ross,Haha!
321,Ross,Got ya!
322,Ross,"Die, die, die!"
323,Ross,"Respectfully, professor    R. Geller."
324,Ross,Hey!
325,Ross,"Hey, how was the Met?"
326,Ross,Yeah?
327,Ross,"Joey really knows his art, huh?"
328,Ross,What do you mean?
329,Ross,"Wait a minute... when you guys walked    into the Met, did you go to the right?"
330,Ross,"Oh Joey, Joey!"
331,Ross,"But still, I mean, it seems like    you guys are having a great time together."
332,Ross,What?
333,Ross,"What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on."
334,Ross,Yeah.
335,Ross,But you know what?
336,Ross,I think you should give Joey    a chance.
337,Ross,"I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about    art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else."
338,Ross,"And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all    that stuff is because he thought it was important to you."
339,Ross,"You    know, that's the kind of guy Joey is."
340,Ross,That was going to be my next argument.
341,Joey,Hey!
342,Ross,Hey!
343,Joey,You're ready?
344,Joey,Hey Ross!
345,Joey,"That art stuff worked, you hooked me    up."
346,Ross,Glad I could help man.
347,Joey,"Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna    be, but..."
348,Joey,I made it work.
349,Chandler,It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.
350,Chandler,Hello?
351,Chandler,"Oh hi, Doctor Connelly."
352,Chandler,"No, she's not here    but, you know, I can tell her."
353,Chandler,Should I be sitting down for this?
354,Chandler,Oh.
355,Chandler,"Well, so what does that mean?"
356,Chandler,"Ok. Ok, thank you."
357,Chandler,Thanks.
358,Monica,Hey sweetie.
359,Chandler,Doctor Connelly just called.
360,Monica,With good news?
361,Monica,"Of course    it is not good news, you just said  ""Doctor Connelly just called""."
362,Monica,"If it was good news you would have said  ""Doctor Connelly just    called! """
363,Monica,But so what is it?
364,Monica,"Is there a problem, uh?"
365,Monica,Is there a problem    with me or with you?
366,Chandler,Actually it's both of us.
367,Monica,What?
368,Chandler,Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable    environment.
369,Monica,Oh... what does that mean?
370,Chandler,It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers    and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do.
371,Chandler,It    means...
372,Monica,Chandler?
373,Chandler,"It means that we can keep trying, but there's    a good chance this may never happen for us."
374,Monica,Oh my God!
375,Chandler,I'm sorry.
376,Monica,I'm sorry too.
377,Chandler,"Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out."
378,Monica,I know.
379,Monica,Closing credits
380,Phoebe,Good morning receptionist.
381,Phoebe,Rachel Green?
382,Phoebe,"Son of a bitch, she came back?"
383,Phoebe,Are you ready for    your Scottish massage?
384,Phoebe,"Put your face in the hole, lassy."
385,Phoebe,End
