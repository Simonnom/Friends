195,Joey,Well usually...yeah!
196,Joey,"Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice."
197,Joey,"Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me."
198,Joey,I'm such a jerk.
199,Monica,It's okay.
200,Monica,"I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it."
201,Monica,Pheebs?
202,Phoebe,Huh?
203,Monica,Where's your bed?

212,Phoebe,"I-I didn't know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!"
213,Monica,Everybody knows!
214,Phoebe,"That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why."
215,Phoebe,"Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn't sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions."
216,Monica,"Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over."
217,Phoebe,"Yeah, I would've except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side."
218,Monica,What?!?
219,Phoebe,"Okay, this is what I'm talking about, this."
220,Phoebe,I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
221,Monica,You can spill.
222,Monica,In the sink.
223,Phoebe,"Aw, honey it's not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don't see that happening."
224,Monica,"I love you, too."
225,Phoebe,"Aww, good."
226,Phoebe,What?
227,Monica,What?
228,Monica,I'm just said.

261,Ross,"My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over."
262,Phoebe,Oh no!
263,Phoebe,Why?
264,Ross,Cause Carol's a lesbian.
265,Ross,"And, and I'm not one."
266,Ross,And apparently it's not a mix and match situation.
267,Phoebe,Oh my God!
268,Phoebe,I don't believe it!
269,Phoebe,"Oh, you poor bunny."
270,Ross,I'm an idiot.
271,Ross,"I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I'd be out and she'd, she'd see some beautiful woman, and, and she'd be Ross y'know look at her, and I'd think, God, my wife is cool!"

273,Phoebe,"Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?"
274,Ross,"Well, now I do!"
275,Phoebe,I'm sorry.

292,Ross,"Maybe this would've happened if I'd been more nurturing, or I'd paid more attention, or I... had a uterus."
293,Ross,I can't believe this!
294,Phoebe,"I know no, no, y'know you don't deserve this, you don't Ross."
