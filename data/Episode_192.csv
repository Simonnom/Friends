46,Monica,"Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!"
47,Ross,"So, why is Erica coming to visit?"
48,Monica,"Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building..."
49,Chandler,"Oh, those places!"
50,Chandler,"There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes ""Mooooo""!"

54,Ross,Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!
55,Rachel,Ross...
56,Ross,"No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?"
57,Rachel,My father had an heart attack...  ...while I was at Barney’s.
58,Ross,Oh my God.
59,Monica,Honey.
60,Chandler,I'm so sorry...
61,Ross,Is-is he ok?
62,Rachel,"Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated."
63,Ross,"Ok, ok."
64,Ross,"I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now."
65,Rachel,"No, come on, I'm totally ok."
66,Rachel,I don't need you to come!
67,Rachel,I can totally handle this on my own.
68,Ross,"Still-still, let me come... for me."
69,Rachel,Ok.
70,Rachel,If you really need to.
71,Ross,I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies.
72,Rachel,"Oh, I really could."
73,Ross,Oh!

122,Rachel,That actually means something here.
123,Rachel,Can somebody please go in?
124,Ross,"Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don't want to infect him."
125,Rachel,"Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!"
126,Ross,"I'm not scared of him, I'm really sick!"
127,Ross,I'm feeling better.
128,Rachel,Oh!
129,Rachel,Oh!
130,Rachel,Oh my God!
131,Rachel,"Ohhh, ohhh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh?"

182,Ross,I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
183,Rachel,Uh.
184,Rachel,Did you call your parents?
185,Ross,"Oh, yeah."
186,Ross,Emma's doing great.
187,Rachel,Oh good.
188,Ross,Wow.
189,Rachel,What?
190,Ross,Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.
191,Rachel,What do you mean?
192,Rachel,You've been in my room before!
193,Ross,"Yeah, sure, right!"
194,Ross,Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room.
195,Rachel,"Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name."
196,Ross,Sorry.
197,Ross,You ok?
198,Rachel,Yeah.
199,Ross,"You had a rough day, uh?"
200,Rachel,"Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know?"
201,Rachel,"I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick!"
202,Ross,But we do!
203,Ross,"It's gonna be ok, Rach!"
204,Rachel,Ow.
205,Rachel,I don't want him to wake up alone!
206,Rachel,I should go to the hospital!
207,Ross,What?
208,Ross,"No, no!"
209,Ross,"Hey, hey, hey look..."
210,Rachel,What?
211,Ross,"They gave him a lot of medication, ok?"
212,Ross,He wouldn't even know if you were there.
213,Ross,"Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?"
214,Rachel,"Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?"
215,Ross,"No, God!"
216,Ross,"Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok?"
217,Ross,Right now you just need to get some rest.
218,Rachel,"Ok, maybe you're right."
219,Ross,Good night.
220,Rachel,"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
221,Rachel,Would you stay here with me for a little while?
222,Ross,Sure!
223,Rachel,Ok.
224,Rachel,Thank you for coming with me today.
225,Ross,"Oh, of course..."
226,Rachel,Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room!
227,Ross,Me too.
228,Ross,Come here.
229,Rachel,I just don't want to be alone tonight.
230,Ross,"Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or... Oh, oh."
231,Ross,"No, Rach!"
232,Ross,"I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea."
233,Rachel,"Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?"
234,Ross,"No, look, uh."
235,Ross,"You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you."
236,Rachel,Taking advantage?
237,Rachel,"I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!"
238,Ross,"Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!"
239,Rachel,Wow.
240,Rachel,Ok.
241,Ross,I'll see you in the morning .
242,Rachel,Mhm-mh!
243,Ross,"Haven't had sex in four months, I should get a medal for that!"
244,Monica,"Oh, I'm glad."
245,Monica,"Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though."
246,Monica,I just did not see this coming.
247,Chandler,New York is awesome!
248,Monica,What is with you?
249,Chandler,"Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know."
250,Monica,"Yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo-ing."
251,Monica,Oh!
252,Monica,It was our pleasure.
253,Monica,We are so much enjoying getting to know you.
254,Chandler,"Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?"
255,Chandler,That's great.
256,Monica,How's that now?
257,Chandler,"So, what does the other guy do?"
258,Chandler,Does he go to college too?
259,Monica,Was he falsely accused of something?
260,Chandler,I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
261,Monica,Are you awake?
262,Chandler,Of course I'm awake.
263,Chandler,Assume from now on that I'm always awake!
264,Monica,"Alright, we don't know that it's him."
265,Monica,"I mean, it could be the football guy."
266,Chandler,"Honey, it's us."
267,Chandler,Of course it's the shovel-killer.
268,Monica,"Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby?"
269,Monica,No!
270,Monica,Would we treat him any differently?
271,Chandler,I'd keep an eye on him!
272,Chandler,We have to find out which one the father is.
273,Monica,How?
274,Chandler,"I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?"
275,Monica,"Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting."
276,Chandler,"Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer."
277,Chandler,He probably loves him mommy.
278,Chandler,"He's probably got a tattoo that says ""mom"" on his shovel-wielding arm!"
279,Joey,"Huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk!"
280,Joey,Thank you.
281,Phoebe,Hey Joey.
282,Joey,Hey!
283,Phoebe,"Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient."
284,Phoebe,SO lets try it again.
285,Joey,"Oh, no, that's okay, I don't need your help."
286,Joey,"I worked on it myself and I gotta say, I am pretty good!"
287,Phoebe,"Really, can I hear some of it."
288,Joey,"Sure, sure."
289,Joey,"Ok,  ""Bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu""  See?"
290,Phoebe,"Well, you're not,  You're not... you're not... again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!"
291,Joey,"Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part."
292,Phoebe,How could you possibly think that?
293,Joey,"For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!"
294,Ross,"Hey Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?"
295,Rachel,Sure.
296,Ross,You've been quiet all morning.
297,Ross,Is everything okay?
298,Rachel,Hmm-hmm.
299,Ross,You sure you're alright?
300,Rachel,Yep.
301,Ross,O-kay.
302,Ross,"Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast."
303,Rachel,FYI..
304,Ross,There it is...
305,Rachel,"In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it."
306,Ross,"Wait, wait,  You're mad at me about last night?"
307,Ross,I was just trying to do the right thing.
308,Rachel,Really?
309,Rachel,"Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!"
310,Ross,Well...
311,Rachel,Oh stop that!
312,Ross,I can't believe this.
313,Ross,I was just being a good guy.
314,Ross,I treated you with respect and understanding.
315,Rachel,"Oh, that is so hot."
316,Rachel,She walks around him to the other side)
317,Ross,"Hey, I was looking out for you."
318,Rachel,"Oh, really, well Ross, you know what?"
319,Rachel,I am a big girl.
320,Rachel,I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.
321,Ross,"I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever."
322,Rachel,"Oh, really, really?"
323,Rachel,"Well, it wasn't very good for me either."
324,Ross,Hey you know what?
325,Ross,You know what?
326,Ross,"To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again."
327,Rachel,What?
328,Ross,"That's right, sex is off the table."
329,Ross,I am never having sex with you again.
330,Ross,"Dr. Green, are you feeling better?"
331,Chandler,Hey!
332,Chandler,How was lunch?
333,Chandler,"Oh, really?"
334,Chandler,O-okay.
335,Chandler,"So, is she gonna take the test?"
336,Monica,"Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is."
337,Chandler,Oh God.
338,Chandler,"It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?"
339,Monica,No it's not.
340,Chandler,How do you know?
341,Chandler,Oh God!
342,Chandler,What was it?
343,Chandler,The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
344,Monica,The thing we never do.
345,Chandler,Shovely Joe!
346,Joey,Right.

379,Rachel,"Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say ""thank you"" for coming with me."
380,Ross,"Oh, no problem."
381,Rachel,"And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again."
382,Ross,Thank you.
383,Ross,I'm glad you agree.
384,Rachel,"It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good."
385,Ross,"Yeah... Yeah, that's true."

393,Ross,Not even once.
394,Rachel,No matter how much we want it.
395,Ross,Even if we want it really bad.
396,Rachel,That's what we decided.
397,Ross,"Uhm, right!"
398,Rachel,...It's kinda hard though!
399,Ross,Yeah.
400,Rachel,"You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste."
