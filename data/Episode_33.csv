36,Chandler,Oh yeah?
37,Chandler,"Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you  never go out of stylewhat did you throw away?"

54,Monica,"Oh no, two days, you must be bummed."
55,Ross,"Yeah, she's got to go back to London."
56,Ross,But you know what?
57,Ross,I've been prepared for this from the start.
58,Ross,"We both knew we had two weeks together, and that's it."
59,Ross,Y'know.
60,Joey,Hey that's what all my relationships are like.

67,Phoebe,I know!
68,Phoebe,Yeah!
69,Phoebe,So the baby is totally craving meat.
70,Phoebe,"This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y'know?"
71,Phoebe,And I got nauseous.
72,Chandler,Maybe that's because soy-burgers suck!
73,Phoebe,Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
74,Joey,"Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow."
75,Phoebe,That's sweat.
76,Phoebe,"You throw up all morning, you'll have that glow too."
77,Rachel,"Oh, here's that trench-coat that you wanted."
78,Rachel,Yeah?
79,Rachel,"Oh no-no, no-no, they don't want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store."
80,Rachel,"Well, that's because of a lot of"

88,Rachel,"Oops, sorry."
89,Rachel,"Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight!"
90,Rachel,"Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans."
91,Chandler,What are you talking about?
92,Joey,"Yeah, what' going on?"
93,Rachel,We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily.
94,Rachel,But it's actually for Joshua.
95,Rachel,"Look, he said he's not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!"
96,Ross,"Well, as much as I'd like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren't going to be here."
97,Ross,All right?
98,Ross,"I mean, she's going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I've got a whole special evening planned."
99,Ross,"So I'm sorry, no party."
100,Joey,Awwww!
101,Rachel,Surprise!!!
102,Rachel,Chandler and
103,Joey,Surprise!
104,Rachel,"Well, it was all Ross's idea."
105,Ross,You really didn't know?
106,Chandler,Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there?
107,Rachel,"Uhh, because I'm trying to play hard to get."
108,Rachel,"Oh, quick he's looking over here, say something funny."
109,Chandler,Like what?
110,Joey,What-what-what is so funny?
111,Chandler,"I said, ""Like what?"""
112,Joey,Now that's a thinker.
113,Rachel,"Okay, y'know what, y'know what?"
114,Rachel,This playing hard to get thing is not working.
115,Rachel,"Umm, hand-hand me those cherries."
116,Rachel,Okay.
117,Rachel,Okay.
118,Rachel,Hi!
119,Rachel,Care for a cherry?
120,Rachel,No?
121,Rachel,"Y'know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue."
122,Ross,So we should probably get going soon.
123,Ross,"Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y'know, then The Plaza for dinner."
124,Ross,"No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short."
125,Ross,"It's usually, ""Surprise!"""
126,Ross,"And then, ""Oh my God, I'm so surprisedgood-bye!"""

128,Phoebe,"Ooh, yeah."
129,Phoebe,Then what are you going to put on top of that?

156,Joey,"Were you like in the movie, or Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve."
157,Joey,"Very sexy, and classy."

177,Ross,"Okay, that-that's enough!"
178,Ross,"Y'know, let's, let's let someone else play."
179,Joey,"If you didn't want to play, why did you come to the party?"
180,Rachel,"Okay, my turn!!"
181,Rachel,"Rachel squeals in delight and starts a slow sexy crawl over to Joshua, making sure he and everyone else watching gets a good look at her cleavage.)"
182,Phoebe,Oh my God!!
183,Phoebe,The baby just kicked!
184,Rachel,It's okay!
185,Rachel,It's okay!
186,Rachel,"It kicked once, it'll kick again!"

188,Rachel,Just a bug.
189,Rachel,Commercial Break
190,Phoebe,Y'know it doesn't matter how much I'm craving it.
191,Phoebe,Y'know why I'm never gonna eat meat?
192,Phoebe,"Because it's murder, cold blooded murder."
193,Chandler,Okay.
194,Chandler,There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!
195,Joey,"Phoebe, what-what are you doing?"
196,Phoebe,I can't help it.
197,Phoebe,I need the meat.
198,Phoebe,The baby needs the meat.
199,Joey,"All right look, y'know how-y'know how when you're dating someone and you don't want to cheat on them, unless it's with someone really hot?"
200,Phoebe,"Yeah, totally!"
201,Joey,All right.
202,Joey,Okay.
203,Joey,Well this is the same kind of deal.
204,Joey,"If you're going to do something wrong,  do it right!"
205,Joey,Feel better now?
206,Phoebe,"Yeah, but at what cost?"
207,Phoebe,"Six more months, three meals a day, I'm gonna eat like, y'know millions of cows."
208,Joey,"Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise."
209,Phoebe,What?
210,Joey,"Well, I eat a lot of meat right?"
211,Phoebe,Yeah.
212,Joey,"Well, suppose until the baby's born I laid off it."
213,Joey,"No extra animals would die, you-you'd just be eating my animals."
214,Phoebe,"Joey, I can't believe you would do that for me."
215,Joey,Absolutely!
216,Joey,I could be a vegetarian.
217,Joey,"There's no meat in beer, right?"
218,Ross,"Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away."
219,Monica,Oh my God!
220,Monica,Have you lost your mind?
221,Rachel,No-n-n-n-no!

260,Rachel,Yeah.
261,Rachel,"A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories."
262,Rachel,"If these walls could talk, y'know what they'd say?"
263,Rachel,Wanna hear some memories?
264,Rachel,Oh no-no-no!
265,Rachel,"No, I got this all under control."
266,Rachel,Ughhhh!!
267,Rachel,Forget it!
268,Rachel,"This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen."
269,Rachel,Can you not look at me when I say this?
270,Rachel,"I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you."
271,Rachel,"Well, I'm sorry, I thought you needed them!"
272,Rachel,Why?
273,Rachel,You like me?
274,Rachel,Yeah but-but-but you liked me!

280,Rachel,But.
281,Rachel,Okay.
282,Rachel,"Ohh, here you are."
283,Rachel,I was looking for you before.
284,Rachel,Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.
285,Ross,That's okay.
286,Ross,"She's still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it's too late to do any of the things I had planned, so"
287,Rachel,"Oh, Ross, I'm sorry."
288,Rachel,I completely ruined your evening.
289,Ross,Yeah.
290,Rachel,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself."
291,Ross,Helps a little.
292,Rachel,Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
293,Ross,"Yeah, have a seat."
294,Rachel,I'm so sorry.
295,Ross,"That's okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn't want it to end this way, y'know?"
296,Rachel,"Well, maybe you didn't want it to end?"
297,Ross,What do you mean?
298,Rachel,You seem to really like her.
299,Ross,"Yeah, I really do."
300,Ross,"Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment."
301,Rachel,"Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks."
302,Ross,You think?
303,Rachel,"Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip."
304,Ross,"Hey, you're right."
305,Rachel,Yeah.
306,Ross,Thanks.
307,Ross,What photo album was it?
308,Rachel,"I don't know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids."
309,Ross,Oh my God!
310,Ross,"Those weren't albino kids, that was computer camp!"
311,Ross,Rach!
312,Rachel,Hey.
313,Chandler,Hey.
314,Rachel,"You're a pathetic loser, right?"
315,Chandler,"Oh-ho, yeah!"

318,Rachel,They're not true?
319,Rachel,Oh.

331,Phoebe,"Hm-mm, corn beef."
332,Joey,"Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that's much better."
333,Joey,How about a little of that smoked turkey?
334,Phoebe,Okay.
335,Joey,Oh mama!
336,Joey,Uh when-when is the baby due?
337,Phoebe,Six months.
338,Joey,Ugh.
339,Joey,"Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?"
340,Phoebe,Not if I get there first.
341,Phoebe,End
