8,Joey,"Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?"
9,Chandler,Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?
10,Joey,"No, no, no."
11,Joey,"When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to    be at the Wizzards-Knicks game ."
12,Joey,courtside!
13,Chandler,Courtside?
14,Chandler,Oh my God.
15,Joey,Yeah.
16,Joey,Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with    his knee.
17,Chandler,That's so cool.
18,Chandler,I'll let Monica know.
19,Monica,Hello?
20,Chandler,Joey just called.
21,Chandler,He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and    me tomorrow night.
22,Monica,Really?
23,Monica,But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant.
24,Monica,"If you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week."
25,Chandler,"But hey, it's courtside."
26,Chandler,The cheerleaders are going to be right    in fr.
27,Chandler,That's not the way to convince you.
28,Monica,"Chandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, ""You    can't go to the game."
29,Monica,"You have to spend time with me."""
30,Monica,"So, if you could just    realize it on your own ."
31,Chandler,I know.
32,Chandler,You're right.
33,Chandler,I want to see you too.
34,Chandler,"I've just got to    figure out a way to tell Joey, you know?"
35,Chandler,He's really looking forward to this.
36,Monica,Tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time.
37,Monica,Tell him    that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult.
38,Monica,Tell him that    what little time we have is precious.
39,Chandler,"Yeah, ah, ah ."
40,Chandler,I'll think of something.
41,Ross,Wow!
42,Ross,"Wow, You look ."
43,Ross,uh .
44,Ross,"It's just, ah ."
45,Ross,That    dress .
46,Ross,uh .
47,Rachel,"Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good."
48,Ross,"Well, well, they're good."
49,Ross,It's been a while since I've seen you like    this.
50,Ross,"You, you clean up good."
51,Rachel,"Oh well, well thank you."
52,Rachel,"Okay,    stop."
53,Rachel,Stop looking at me like that.
54,Rachel,"The last time that happened,  that happened."
55,Ross,"Oh right, right."
56,Ross,"So, are you ."
57,Ross,ah .
58,Ross,"you excited about your, your first night    away from Emma?"
59,Rachel,"Yeah, yeah."
60,Rachel,Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun.
61,Rachel,"And thank    you for watching the baby, by the way."
62,Ross,"Oh, it's fine."
63,Ross,"Actually, I, I invited Mike over."
64,Rachel,Phoebe's Mike?
65,Ross,Yeah.
66,Rachel,I didn't know you guys hung out.
67,Ross,We don't.
68,Ross,But I thought it would be nice to get to know him.
69,Ross,"You know,    maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation."
70,Rachel,Oh that's so
71,Ross,I don't know.
72,Ross,"But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know."
73,Ross,He plays piano; I played keyboards in college.
74,Ross,He's been divorced; I have some    experience in that area.
75,Rachel,Yeah.
76,Phoebe,Hi
77,Rachel,Hey.
78,Phoebe,Oooh.
79,Phoebe,Girl's night out indeed.
80,Rachel,Ok.

82,Ross,"Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right?"
83,Ross,You go have fun.
84,Rachel,Okay.
85,Rachel,You too.
86,Rachel,And I hope you score.

88,Ross,So .
89,Ross,Welcome.
90,Ross,I got bottled breast milk.
91,Ross,Okay.
92,Ross,"So, um, Phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano."
93,Ross,"You know, I, I used to, ah, play keyboards in college."
94,Ross,No.
95,Ross,Um .
96,Ross,ah .
97,Ross,"you know, I'm divorced."
98,Ross,"Um, Phoebe, ah ."
99,Ross,Phoebe    said you .
100,Ross,You've been divorced?
101,Ross,That's okay.
102,Ross,We'll talk about  something else.
103,Ross,Yeah.
104,Ross,Ah?
105,Ross,"Well, he and I would probably have    a lot to talk about."
106,Monica,Hi.
107,Chandler,Hey.
108,Monica,Welcome home.
109,Chandler,"Oh well, look at you."
110,Monica,Yeah.
111,Monica,What do you think?
112,Chandler,"Well, it looks great."
113,Chandler,It's just that .
114,Chandler,"well, I'm wearing the    same thing underneath."
115,Chandler,So .
116,Monica,Oh.
117,Chandler,See what I mean .
118,Joey,Hey!
119,Joey,How come the door's locked?
120,Monica,Just a second.
121,Chandler,"No, no, no, no, no."
122,Chandler,Joey can't know that I'm here.
123,Monica,Why not?
124,Chandler,Because I didn't know how to tell him that I couldn't go to the Knicks    game.
125,Chandler,"So, I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa."
126,Monica,"So, you lied to him?"
127,Chandler,Achhh.
128,Chandler,It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.
129,Chandler,Except with you.
130,Joey,Hey!
131,Joey,Open the door.
132,Joey,What's going on?
133,Joey,What are you .
134,Joey,..  Why are you dressed    like that?
135,Monica,"Oh, because, um ."
136,Monica,"well, Chandler's going to be home in a couple    of days."
137,Monica,"So, I thought I would, you know, practice the art of seduction."
138,Joey,"Oh, I thought I heard a man's voice before."
139,Monica,Oh I was just doing Chandler's side of the conversation.
140,Monica,"You know,    like, ""Hi, How do I look?"""
141,Monica,"""Really sexy."
142,Monica,"Could I BE any more    turned on?"""
143,Joey,Okay.
144,Joey,"Whoa, whoa."
145,Joey,Why are there two glasses of wine out?
146,Monica,Because.
147,Monica,one of them is for you.
148,Monica,Cheers.
149,Monica,"Okay, buh-bye."
150,Chandler,"You know, it's funny."
151,Chandler,"I've been, ah, practicing the art of seduction    myself."
152,Chandler,Hi ya.
153,Monica,You might want to keep practicing.
154,Chandler,Yah.
155,Chandler,It's Joey.
156,Chandler,Hey Joe.
157,Joey,"Dude, come home!"
158,Chandler,What?
159,Chandler,Why?
160,Joey,COME .
161,Joey,HOME.
162,Chandler,"Look I, I can't."
163,Chandler,What's going on?
164,Joey,"I don't know how to tell you this but, uh ."
165,Joey,I think Monica's cheatin'    on ya.
166,Joey,I told you shouldn't have married someone so much hotter than you.
167,Joey,All right look.
168,Joey,"If you can't come home and    deal with this, then I'm gonna."
169,Chandler,NO!
170,Joey,I just heard him!
171,Chandler,Can you .
172,Chandler,hear him .
173,Chandler,now?
174,Joey,No.
175,Joey,"All right, I'm going in."
176,Chandler,No!
177,Chandler,Wait!
178,Joey,I heard him again!
179,Chandler,"All right, look."
180,Chandler,Just stay there.
181,Chandler,I'm    coming home.
182,Joey,Okay.
183,Joey,Great.
184,Joey,I'll see you when you get here.
185,Joey,I'm gonna wait out in    the hall in case the dude comes out.
186,Chandler,Is that really necessary?
187,Joey,Absolutely.
188,Joey,You'd do it for me.
189,Joey,Not that you ever have to because I    know how to keep my women satisfied.
190,Ross,Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?
191,Ross,"I mean, they said thirty minutes    or less."
192,Ross,"Well, how long has it been?"
193,Ross,I do.
194,Ross,I do.
195,Ross,"Although, it's actually a lager."
196,Ross,I don't know.
197,Ross,We could look it up.
198,Phoebe,Oh God.
199,Phoebe,Remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around    talking about you and Ross?
200,Rachel,Oh God.
201,Rachel,It seems like forever ago.
202,Phoebe,I know.
203,Phoebe,"So, what's going on with you and Ross?"
204,Rachel,"Well, um ."
205,Rachel,I don't know.
206,Rachel,"I mean, for a long time nothing."
207,Rachel,"But    you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a ."
208,Rachel,ah    .
209,Rachel,little thing.
210,Phoebe,Oh my God!
211,Phoebe,I love things.
212,Phoebe,What happened?
213,Rachel,"Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked."
214,Rachel,"And, ah, then we    had a little ."
215,Rachel,um .
216,Rachel,eye-contact.
217,Phoebe,Eye-contact?
218,Rachel,Mm-hmm.
219,Phoebe,I hope you were using protection.
220,Rachel,Oh.
221,Rachel,Should we send them something back?
222,Phoebe,Oooh.
223,Phoebe,Let's do.
224,Phoebe,Let's send them mashed potatoes.
225,Rachel,No!
226,Rachel,Wait!
227,Rachel,"No, no."
228,Rachel,Don't do that!
229,Rachel,That's going to make them think    they can come over here.
230,Phoebe,So?
231,Phoebe,What if they do?
232,Rachel,"Well, we're not here to meet guys."
233,Rachel,"You have a boyfriend, I have a    b. ."
234,Rachel,baby and a Ross.
235,Phoebe,"Yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen."
236,Phoebe,We're just having fun.
237,Phoebe,"You know, not everything had to go as far as ""eye-contact."""
238,Monica,"Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa."
239,Chandler,"Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating    on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him?"
240,Chandler,I heard it.
241,Monica,I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.
242,Chandler,All right.
243,Chandler,I've got a plan.
244,Chandler,I'll go down the fire escape.
245,Monica,"Yes, because all good plans start with, ""I'll go down the fire escape."""
246,Chandler,Hear me out woman.
247,Chandler,I'll go down the fire escape.
248,Chandler,"Then, I'll wait    for a while."
249,Chandler,"Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got    back from Tulsa."
250,Chandler,"Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy    in here."
251,Monica,Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out?
252,Monica,I heard it.
253,Chandler,I'm just going to wait for a little while.
254,Monica,Scary pigeon's back?
255,Chandler,It's huge.
256,Rachel,Oh my God.
257,Rachel,I can't believe you live in that building.
258,Rachel,My grandmother    lives in that building.
259,Rachel,Ida Green?
260,Rachel,No sense of personal space?
261,Rachel,Kind of smells    like chicken?
262,Rachel,Looks like a potato.
263,Rachel,That's my bubby!
264,Phoebe,Yeah.
265,Phoebe,I'm sorry.
266,Phoebe,We weren't really looking for anything to happen    with you guys.
267,Phoebe,"I, I have a boyfriend."
268,Rachel,"Oh, well, it's complicated."
269,Rachel,I don't actually have a boyfriend.
270,Rachel,But    um.
271,Rachel,"I'm sorry, no."
272,Rachel,Oh sure.
273,Phoebe,"Oh my God, you're giving your real number."
274,Rachel,Great.
275,Phoebe,Bye.
276,Phoebe,Wow.
277,Phoebe,"So, that's great."
278,Phoebe,"You, Bill, Ross, and Emma    are going to be so happy together."
279,Phoebe,What were you thinking?
280,Rachel,I don't know.
281,Rachel,"He was cute, and he liked me."
282,Rachel,It was an impulse.
283,Phoebe,What about Ross?
284,Phoebe,What about your moment?
285,Phoebe,Don't you want to talk to    Ross about it?
286,Rachel,No.
287,Rachel,"No, because I know exactly how the conversation's gonna go."
288,Rachel,"""Hey    Ross, you know, I think we had a moment before."""
289,Rachel,"""Yeah."""
290,Rachel,"""Me too."""
291,Rachel,"""Well, but I'm not sure I really want to do anything about    it."""
292,Rachel,"""Yeah."""
293,Rachel,"""Me neither."""
294,Rachel,"""Well, should we just continue to live together and not    really tell each other how we're really feeling?"""
295,Rachel,"""Yeah."
296,Rachel,"That works for me."""
297,Phoebe,"Yeah, I see what you mean."
298,Phoebe,"By the way, nice Ross imitation."
299,Rachel,"Oh, thanks."
300,Phoebe,"But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough."
301,Rachel,Wha.
302,Rachel,hey!
303,Phoebe,Better!
304,Rachel,"Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments    with Ross, you know?"
305,Rachel,I should just .
306,Rachel,move on with my life.
307,Phoebe,Really?
308,Phoebe,You're moving on from Ross?
309,Rachel,I don't know.
310,Rachel,Do I have to decide right now?
311,Phoebe,"Well, you kind of just did."
312,Phoebe,That guy is going to call you tonight.
313,Phoebe,Ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message.
314,Rachel,"Oh God, Ross."
315,Rachel,Ross is going to pick up the phone.
316,Rachel,"Oh, I have to get    my number back."
317,Rachel,Oh my God.
318,Rachel,He's gone.
319,Phoebe,"""Oh, I have to get my number back."
320,Phoebe,Oh my God.
321,Phoebe,"He's gone."""
322,Phoebe,Dead on.
323,Ross,So soon?
324,Ross,Okay.
325,Ross,"Well, thanks, ah, thanks for the beer."
326,Ross,Ah yeah.
327,Ross,Good times.
328,Phoebe,"Hey, Mike, it's me."
329,Phoebe,"Listen,    is um, is Ross near you?"
330,Phoebe,"Well, you have to go back in."
331,Phoebe,"I'm so sorry honey, but, okay, Rachel gave this guy her number and,    um, she doesn't want Ross to answer the phone."
332,Phoebe,"So, you have to intercept all    his calls."
333,Phoebe,He says he can't do that.
334,Rachel,"Oh give me , , ,  Hi, Mike?"
335,Rachel,Hi.
336,Rachel,Listen.
337,Rachel,"I know this is a lot to ask, but you know what?"
338,Rachel,If you do this I .
339,Rachel,Phoebe will .
340,Rachel,do anything you want.
341,Rachel,"Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff."
342,Phoebe,All right.
343,Phoebe,Hello?
344,Phoebe,Hi.
345,Phoebe,"I'm sorry    about her, but she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff."
346,Phoebe,"Oh, Mike."
347,Phoebe,Bye.
348,Ross,"Uh, hi."
349,Ross,Why?
350,Ross,But you left.
351,Joey,Wow!
352,Joey,That didn't take long.
353,Joey,"I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three    hour flight."
354,Chandler,"Well, you're forgetting about the time difference."
355,Monica,Chandler!
356,Monica,You're home!
357,Chandler,That's right.
358,Chandler,You're husband's home.
359,Chandler,"So, now the sex can stop."
360,Monica,What are you saying?
361,Chandler,Joey said that you're in here with another man.
362,Monica,There's no man in here.
363,Monica,How dare you accuse me of that.
364,Joey,All right.
365,Joey,All right.
366,Joey,"Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend    take a look around, huh?"
367,Joey,Bwa-ah-ah!
368,Chandler,What is he doing?
369,Monica,I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.
370,Joey,"Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows."
371,Chandler,All right.
372,Chandler,"Well, I'll check the guest room."
373,Joey,Why do I smell men's cologne?
374,Monica,I think that's you.
375,Joey,Oh yeah.
376,Joey,I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
377,Chandler,There's nobody here Joe.
378,Joey,I guess not.
379,Monica,I can't believe you thought I was cheating.
380,Monica,You    own me an apology.
381,Joey,"Yeah, right Monica."
382,Joey,I'm so sorry.
383,Monica,"Ah, it's an honest mistake."
384,Monica,It could    happen to anyone.
385,Monica,"All right, see ya."
386,Joey,"Whoa,    whoa."
387,Joey,Wait a minute.
388,Joey,Wait a minute.
389,Joey,"If you just got back from Tulsa, how    did your suitcase beat you here?"
390,Chandler,I climb down the fire escape and you    can't put that in the closet?
391,Ross,"Maybe you should look up ""fascinating."""
392,Ross,I don't understand what just happened    here.
393,Joey,What's going on?
394,Chandler,I'm sorry.
395,Chandler,"I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend    the night with Monica and I, I didn't know ."
396,Chandler,I didn't think you'd understand.
397,Joey,What?
398,Joey,You think I'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be    with his wife?
399,Joey,Huh?
400,Joey,"Do you think I'm like, ""Duh."""
401,Monica,Joey?
402,Joey,Yeah?
403,Monica,I don't know what to say.
404,Monica,We shouldn't have lied to you.
405,Chandler,Yeah.
406,Chandler,I feel so bad.
407,Chandler,Is there anything I can do to make it up to    you?
408,Joey,"Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know    you said you couldn't."
409,Joey,But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a    bump on the head.
410,Chandler,I'm sorry.
411,Chandler,That's the one thing I can't do.
412,Chandler,I promised I'd be with    Monica.
413,Joey,All right.
414,Monica,You can go.
415,Chandler,What?
416,Monica,You should go to the game.
417,Monica,It's okay.
418,Monica,I want you to.
419,Chandler,Really?
420,Chandler,You're gonna be okay?
421,Monica,"Yeah, I'll be fine."
422,Monica,"You know, maybe I'll stay here and practice the    art of seduction."
423,Chandler,"You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?"
424,Monica,It's gonna be so hot!
425,Chandler,"Okay, bye."
426,Monica,Have fun.
427,Joey,Thanks.
428,Joey,Here's your ticket.
429,Chandler,"Hey, listen."
430,Chandler,"I'm never going to lie to you again, okay?"
431,Chandler,And I want    you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid.
432,Joey,Thanks man.
433,Joey,Where are you going?
434,Chandler,Game's tomorrow night Joe.

444,Rachel,That was fun Pheebs.
445,Phoebe,I know.
