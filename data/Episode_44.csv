180,Chandler,"Yeah, I guess I could use that."
181,Chandler,I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
182,Ross,"Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon."
183,Ross,"But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely."
184,Chandler,"Wait a minute, I can't give this to her."
185,Ross,Why not?
