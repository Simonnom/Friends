50,Joey,"Yeah, that was real."
51,Phoebe,Wow!
52,Phoebe,I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
53,Rachel,I know.
54,Phoebe,"What, so what are you gonna tell him?"
55,Rachel,"Well, I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no."
56,Phoebe,Huh.
57,Rachel,I mean I think I'd say no to anybody right now.
58,Rachel,"Oh, but it was so strange."
59,Rachel,"I mean I'm standing there with this charming, cute guy, who's asking me to go out with him, which I'm allowed to do, and I felt guilty."
60,Rachel,"Y'know, like I'd be cheating on Ross or something."
61,Phoebe,Wow.
62,Phoebe,"So, okay, maybe that means that, you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father."
63,Rachel,I don't have any issues with my Father.

65,Joey,I hate this woman!!
66,Joey,I hate her!
67,Joey,"She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks."

77,Chandler,It's possible.
78,Chandler,"You are very loveable, I'd miss you if I broke up with you."
79,Chandler,I was just trying to be supportive.

138,Ross,You have a pleasant evening.
139,Phoebe,"So, you're like a zillionaire?"
140,Chandler,And you're our age.
141,Chandler,You're our age.
142,Phoebe,"Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself."
143,Phoebe,"Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete."
144,Joey,"Oh, oh, I got it!"
145,Joey,Pete-Chicago.
146,Chandler,That's not a state Joe.
147,Joey,"Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?"
148,Chandler,You're our age!
149,Monica,Absolutely!
150,Monica,Now get out of here you!!
151,Monica,"Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him!"
152,Monica,"Look, is there something wrong with me?"
153,Monica,I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future?
154,Monica,"Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on!"
155,Monica,"I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?"
156,Phoebe,"Yeah, kinda."
157,Joey,"Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be!"
158,Joey,Huh?
159,Joey,Because I sure as hell can't figure it out!
160,Joey,I talk to you and nothin'.
161,Joey,"You look at me, and it's nothin'."
162,Joey,Nothing.

166,Joey,"Ah, it's says so in the script!"
167,Joey,"Y'know ah, I-I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch."
168,Joey,It does in mine!
169,Chandler,I can blow dry it.
170,Chandler,I can put gel on it.
171,Chandler,"It doesn't matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head."
172,Chandler,It's so annoying.
173,Chandler,Does it bug you?
174,Ross,You bug me.
175,Chandler,Is there any chance you didn't see that?
176,Chandler,Commercial Break

179,Chandler,Okay?!
180,Chandler,You can't just stare through the peep hole for three hours!
181,Chandler,You're gonna get peep eye!
182,Ross,I knew it!
183,Ross,I knew it!
184,Ross,I always knew she liked him!
185,Ross,"Y'know, she'd say no, but here we are!"
186,Ross,Right?
187,Ross,"We just broke up, first thing she does!"
188,Chandler,You didn't just break up.
189,Ross,"Hey, it's been like three weeks!"
190,Chandler,You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up.
191,Chandler,I mean bullets have left guns slower!
192,Ross,"Here they come, here they come."
193,Ross,"Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I'm gonna kill myself, I swear."

202,Ross,He's going in!!
203,Ross,The door's closed!
204,Ross,"I, I can't see anything but the door closed!"
205,Chandler,And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
206,Ross,"Okay, I have to do something."
207,Ross,"I mean, I have, I have to stop it!"
208,Chandler,Stop what?
209,Ross,"I don't know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it."
210,Ross,I'll go over and I will borrow something.

219,Ross,People need juice!
220,Chandler,Look man!
221,Ross,People need juice!
222,Chandler,Listen to me!
223,Ross,"Juice, I need..."
224,Chandler,She's moving on!
225,Chandler,"Okay, if it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else!"
226,Chandler,"And unless you're thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over!"
227,Chandler,"Okay, man?"
228,Chandler,It's over.
229,Ross,"Yeah, okay."
230,Chandler,Okay.
231,Ross,It's just I miss her so much.
232,Chandler,I know.
233,Rachel,Oh.
234,Rachel,That's so Monica can keep track.
235,Rachel,"That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, Â‘Where's number 27?!'"
236,Rachel,Y'know what?
237,Rachel,I can't do this.
238,Rachel,"Well, oh, Mark, I'm doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know?"
239,Rachel,I'm just doing it to get back at Ross.
240,Rachel,"I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you."
241,Rachel,Oh God.
242,Rachel,I'm sorry about this.
243,Rachel,You sure?
244,Monica,Sure.
245,Monica,"Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I'm gonna say, midget rodeo."
246,Monica,Okay.
247,Monica,"Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship."
248,Monica,So I did tell you.
249,Monica,"Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing."
250,Monica,"Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me."
251,Monica,Y'know what I mean?
252,Monica,I so wanna be attracted to you.
253,Monica,I'm sorry.
254,Monica,It's not?
255,Monica,"Well, um, look I-I don't want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted too."
256,Chandler,I don't think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in.
257,Chandler,Draw!
258,Chandler,I wasn't doing anything.
259,Chandler,"Uh-oh, what did she do now?"
260,Joey,"Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she's like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!"
261,Chandler,"Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth."
262,Joey,"God, I just, I hate her!"
263,Joey,I hate her!!
264,Joey,"With her, Â‘Oh, I'm so talented.'"
265,Joey,"and Â‘Oh, I'm so pretty,' and Â‘Ooh, I smell so good.'"
266,Chandler,I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
267,Joey,"Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?!"
268,Joey,Y'know?
269,Chandler,I'm talking about you.
270,Chandler,"You big, big freak."
271,Joey,Oh.
272,Joey,Ohh.
273,Joey,"Ohh, you're out of your mind."
274,Chandler,"Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours!"
275,Chandler,If you were in a school yard you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
276,Joey,"Oh, yeah?!"
277,Joey,Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?
278,Joey,"Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be!"
279,Joey,Huh?
280,Joey,Because I sure as hell can't figure it out!
281,Joey,I talk to you and it's nothin'.
282,Joey,"You look at me, and nothin'."
283,Joey,Nothing.
284,Joey,The
285,Joey,Better?

293,Phoebe,"Y'know like Goldman, Silverman..."
294,Chandler,Â‘Cause it's-it's not his last name.
295,Phoebe,It isn't?
296,Chandler,"No, it's not like, like Phil Spiderman."
297,Chandler,"He's a spider, man."
298,Chandler,"Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there's no Gold Man."
299,Phoebe,"Oh, okay."
300,Phoebe,There should be Gold Man!
301,Rachel,Hey!
302,Monica,"Hey, Rach, how was work?"
303,Rachel,"Oh, great."
304,Rachel,Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
305,Monica,"By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff."
306,Rachel,"Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming."
307,Rachel,"I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and..."
308,Monica,Something wrong?
309,Rachel,No.
310,Rachel,Nothing.
311,Rachel,Closing Credits
312,Chandler,"So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?"
313,Phoebe,"Okay well, he would turn things to gold."
314,Chandler,What about things that are already gold?
315,Phoebe,"Ahh, his work is done."
316,Chandler,"Okay, let's play my game now."
317,Phoebe,Okay.
318,Phoebe,All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!!
319,Phoebe,End
