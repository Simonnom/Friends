1,Joey,Her first cookie?
2,Joey,She has cookies all the time!
3,Rachel,I've never given her a cookie.
4,Rachel,Have you?
5,Joey,No!
6,Joey,"No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from    a can!"
7,Monica,"Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we    were wondering if you would write one for us."
8,Rachel,"Of course, I'd be honored!"
9,Chandler,Thanks!
10,Monica,Thank you!
11,Joey,"U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight."
12,Chandler,"Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested."
13,Monica,"Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much ""with    the words""."
14,Joey,Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!
15,Monica,Clearly we were wrong.
16,Joey,"I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok?"
17,Joey,"And I know how    much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one."
18,Monica,You know what?
19,Monica,"Then, Joey, we want you to do it."
20,Joey,Thank you!

31,Rachel,"Your first date, your first kiss,    first time you had sex..."
32,Phoebe,YEAH!
33,Chandler,So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
34,Phoebe,Uh-uh.
35,Phoebe,"Ehm, a Knicks game."
36,Joey,Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?
37,Phoebe,"Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so    no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and..."
38,Phoebe,I'm gonna put    on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room.
39,Monica,You guys do that?
40,Monica,Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom!
41,Chandler,That's where people make number two!!
42,Chandler,OPENING CREDITS
43,Ross,Hey...
44,Ross,Oh...   Ohh...
45,Ross,I'd love to    but I really have to grade these papers.
46,Ross,"B, B, B, B, B!"
47,Ross,"Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt."
48,Ross,Damnit!
49,Ross,Hi Amy!
50,Ross,Still sharp as a tack!
51,Ross,Ross?
52,Ross,I...
53,Ross,I grew up on your block!
54,Ross,We had Thanksgiving together    last year...
55,Ross,I had a baby with your sister!
56,Ross,"Yes, yes, you did."
57,Ross,Hi Rachel!
58,Ross,Here's your sister Amy!
59,Ross,She thinks I need   pec implants!
60,Rachel,Amy!
61,Rachel,Hi!
62,Rachel,Oh-oh-hoh!
63,Rachel,Wow!
64,Rachel,You remember Joey?
65,Joey,"That's right, yeah."
66,Joey,Always nice to meet a fan!
67,Rachel,"So now, what are you doing here?"
68,Rachel,"Oh sorry, hold on."
69,Rachel,Let me just    check on the baby!
70,Ross,Ehm...
71,Ross,Her name is Emma.
72,Ross,What do I know?
73,Ross,I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!
74,Ross,Oh my God!
75,Joey,"I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated."
76,Ross,What... what you working on?
77,Joey,"Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation."
78,Joey,I want it    to sound smart but..
79,Joey,"I don't know any big words or anything, so..."
80,Ross,Why don't you use your Thesaurus?
81,Joey,What did I just say?
82,Ross,Watch.
83,Ross,"Here, you ehm... You highlight the word    you want to change."
84,Ross,Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list    of choices.
85,Ross,You can pick the word that sounds smartest.
86,Joey,"Oh my God, that's great!"
87,Joey,I'm smart!!
88,Joey,"No, no, I'm...     ""brainy, bright, clever"", I love this thing!"
89,Joey,"Look out ladies, Joey    Tribbiani's got the whole package!"
90,Rachel,God!
91,Rachel,"Oh, I know, isn't she?"
92,Rachel,All right.
93,Rachel,"What's your news, Amy?"
94,Rachel,What?
95,Rachel,Oh my God!
96,Rachel,To who?
97,Rachel,A-And?
98,Rachel,"No, what's he like?"
99,Rachel,Yeah.
100,Rachel,"Huh... wow, so he's gotta be..."
101,Rachel,"Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the    apartment more than you like..."
102,Rachel,"Oh... sit down, sit down."
103,Rachel,"Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married    somebody that I didn’t love."
104,Rachel,Do you remember Barry?
105,Rachel,"Sometimes just nodding is ok.  Uhm, so but   anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever   made."
106,Rachel,"Honey, you deserve   true love."
107,Rachel,"Your soulmate is out there, somewhere."
108,Rachel,"Someone that is your age,   that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!"
109,Rachel,Ok.
110,Rachel,"Ok, let’s keep talking."
111,Phoebe,"Excuse me, anniversary."
112,Phoebe,"Excuse me, anniversary."
113,Phoebe,"Uhm, sir, could you move your nachos... they’re in my    seat."
114,Phoebe,It's my anniversary.
115,Phoebe,Here we are!
116,Phoebe,Can’t believe    it's been a whole year!
117,Phoebe,ME TOO!
118,Phoebe,I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!
119,Phoebe,YOU’RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND  YOU'RE    AMAZING IN BED   IT’S    OUR ANNIVERSARY!
120,Phoebe,"Oh how lame... oh, it’s so tacky, and impersonal."
121,Phoebe,"Oh, it’s the worst way to propose!"
122,Joey,"Hey, finished my recommendation."
123,Joey,Here.
124,Joey,"And I think you’ll be very, very happy."
125,Joey,It’s the    longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.
126,Chandler,I don’t... uh... understand.
127,Joey,Some of the words are a little too sophisticated    for ya?
128,Monica,It doesn’t make any sense.
129,Joey,Of course it does!
130,Joey,It’s smart!
131,Joey,I used the the-saurus!
132,Chandler,On every word?
133,Joey,Yep!
134,Monica,"Alright, what was this sentence originally?"
135,Joey,"Oh, ‘They are warm, nice, people with big hearts’."
136,Chandler,And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens    with full sized aortic pumps...?
137,Joey,"Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude."
138,Monica,"Hey Joey, I don’t think we can use this."
139,Joey,Why not?
140,Monica,"Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani ."
141,Monica,"Hey, why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just    be yourself!"
142,Chandler,You know what?
143,Chandler,"You don’t need a thesaurus, just write from  here,  your full sized aortic pump."
144,Rachel,"Amy, hi!"
145,Rachel,"Oh, good for you!"
146,Rachel,Yes you are!
147,Rachel,"Oh, I am so proud of you!"
148,Rachel,But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
149,Joey,"Ah, look who’s back!"
150,Joey,Why do you have bags?
151,Joey,"RACH,    WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?"
152,Joey,What?
153,Joey,You slept out here?
154,Rachel,"Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‘Myron, get    off!’"
155,Joey,"But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right?"
156,Joey,"Rach, please tell me we’re    getting rid of her."
157,Rachel,"Joey, I can’t do that!"
158,Joey,"Oh, come on!"
159,Joey,"Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said  ""Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!"""
160,Joey,I don’t need that kind of talk in my house!
161,Rachel,"Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she’s difficult, but I think    it’s really good that she’s here."
162,Joey,'Cause we will appreciate it more when she’s gone?
163,Rachel,"No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was    a lot like her!"
164,Rachel,"I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of    me."
165,Joey,"Yeah, Monica made us!"
166,Rachel,"Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don’t    think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn’t for you guys."
167,Rachel,"See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me."
168,Rachel,"And I know it’s gonna    take patience, but that’s ok."
169,Joey,Yeaah.
170,Rachel,"Amy, that’s what I was supposed to wear today, that’s why    I hung it on the door."
171,Rachel,"Amy, you know what?"
172,Rachel,"I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time    for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future."
173,Joey,"I’M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!"
174,Phoebe,Hi.
175,Phoebe,I just had the worst anniversary ever.
176,Chandler,I doubt that!
177,Chandler,Tell her about us last year.
178,Monica,"Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote    me a rap song."
179,Ross,Seriously?
180,Chandler,Word!
181,Phoebe,"Well, mine was worse than that."
182,Rachel,"Well, what happened?"
183,Phoebe,"We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the    big screen thing..."
184,Rachel,"Oh, that is so tacky."
185,Phoebe,"Well, that’s what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning    on proposing to me that same way last night!"
186,Monica,"Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?"
187,Rachel,"Phoebe, that’s huge!"
188,Ross,"Well, do you wanna marry him?"
189,Phoebe,"Yeah, I really do!"
190,Phoebe,"Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna    propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again!"
191,Phoebe,"I mean,    I said no in Barbados and now this!"
192,Chandler,She's right!
193,Chandler,If I were a guy and...  Did I just say if I were a   guy..?
194,Monica,"Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to    him!"
195,Phoebe,"Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?"
196,Monica,I proposed to Chandler!
197,Monica,"Alright,    moving on..."
198,Chandler,"Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!"
199,Monica,Thank you.
200,Phoebe,"Well, do you think   I should propose?"
201,Rachel,I think it could be kind of great!
202,Ross,Absolutely!
203,Ross,You'll love the feeling!
204,Ross,There's nothing like it!
205,Phoebe,"Ok, ok, so how should I do it?"
206,Monica,"How about at a game, on the big screen?"
207,Rachel,Uuuh!!
208,Rachel,How about at a Footlocker?
209,Monica,What?
210,Monica,what?
211,Monica,"He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to,    plus he'd never suspect it!"
212,Phoebe,"Yeah, that does make sense."
213,Phoebe,"Ok, now, would... would you two  like that?"
214,Chandler,Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
215,Rachel,Oh!
216,Rachel,"That's interesting, since she died seven years    ago!"
217,Rachel,Hello?
218,Rachel,"Oh, it's our nanny!"
219,Rachel,Hi!
220,Rachel,Oh... God!
221,Rachel,I hope you feel better!
222,Rachel,"Ok, bye!"
223,Rachel,"That's Molly, she's sick."
224,Rachel,Can you watch Emma today?
225,Ross,"No, I can't."
226,Ross,I have back-to-back classes.
227,Ross,Did Molly say what she had?
228,Ross,Because my throat's been hurting?
229,Rachel,Menstrual cramps.
230,Ross,I don't think that's what this is.
231,Rachel,Can any of you watch Emma?
232,Monica,"No, sorry sweety.."
233,Phoebe,"No, I've got work and then I'm proposing.."
234,Rachel,"Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?"
235,Rachel,"Well, actually..."
236,Ross,"Well, can I talk to you for a sec."
237,Rachel,Yeah.
238,Ross,"Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child."
239,Rachel,Why not?
240,Ross,"Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!"
241,Rachel,"Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!"
242,Ross,"Fine, we'll call the next one Ella."
243,Rachel,Wha... the next one?
244,Ross,"Okay, um..."
245,Ross,I don't want her watching our baby.
246,Rachel,"Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person."
247,Rachel,This is a huge    breakthrough for her!
248,Rachel,She just offered to do something for another human being!
249,Ross,I...
250,Ross,I don't know..
251,Rachel,"Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows  shaped to do this alright?"
252,Rachel,Do you understand    how important that is in our world?
253,Rachel,Absolutely.
254,Chandler,Hey Joe!
255,Chandler,How's the second draft of the letter coming?
256,Joey,"Great, I'm finished!"
257,Joey,"In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency."
258,Monica,You dropped it off?
259,Joey,Yeah.
260,Chandler,Can we read it?
261,Chandler,Can you print out another copy?
262,Joey,No can do amigo.
263,Joey,"No, I didn't use the computer."
264,Joey,Felt more personal to    hand-write it.
265,Monica,You hand-wrote it?
266,Joey,"Yeah, and don't worry."
267,Joey,I didn't try to sound smart at   all!
268,Joey,See ya later!
269,Monica,"Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our    file!"
270,Monica,We're never gonna get a kid.
271,Monica,"No, we're gonna be one of those old couples    that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!"
272,Chandler,"It's ok, it's ok. You know what?"
273,Chandler,I'll just    call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter.
274,Monica,Okay good.
275,Chandler,"Hello, this is Chandler Bing."
276,Chandler,"Somebody just dropped    off a handwritten recommendation letter, and..  Uh-huh... Uh-huh...    okay... thank you."
277,Chandler,Good-bye.
278,Monica,"Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we?"
279,Monica,You know what?
280,Monica,Just tell me on the way    to the bird store.
281,Chandler,They loved it.
282,Monica,What?
283,Chandler,They thought it was very smart of us to have a   child write the recommendation letter.
284,Monica,They thought Joey was a child?
285,Chandler,"She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings."
286,Monica,"Hey, what did you guys do today?"
287,Chandler,That sounds like fun.
288,Rachel,Hey!
289,Rachel,"Hi, how's my girl?"
290,Rachel,Yeah!
291,Rachel,You pierced her ears!
292,Rachel,You pierced her ears?
293,Rachel,How could you do this without telling me?
294,Chandler,I think she looks cute.
295,Chandler,... but I am wrong!
296,Rachel,"Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross."
297,Rachel,He's gonna flip out.
298,Rachel,Ugh.
299,Ross,Hey guys.
300,Ross,Monica and
301,Chandler,Hi Ross.
302,Ross,Hey Emma.
303,Ross,"Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low?"
304,Ross,She can barely see.
305,Rachel,"Nah, I don't really want her to see."
306,Ross,Why not?
307,Monica,Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
308,Chandler,Like war.
309,Chandler,Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator.
310,Chandler,Remember?
311,Chandler,It was    in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
312,Ross,Come here  Oh!
313,Ross,There she is!
314,Ross,Hi!
315,Ross,What?
316,Rachel,Nothing.
317,Ross,Hi!
318,Ross,What... .
319,Ross,Please tell me those are clip-ons.
320,Rachel,"Oh, they're real!"
321,Ross,Did she  do this to her?
322,Ross,I told you we shouldn't have    left Emma with her!
323,Rachel,"I know, I know, and you were right Ross."
324,Rachel,You are soo irresponsible   I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!
325,Monica,"I'm a cool, fun aunt!"
326,Chandler,Hey!
327,Chandler,Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
328,Rachel,I can't believe this.
329,Rachel,All I wanted to do was help you try to figure    out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?
330,Rachel,Oh yeah?
331,Rachel,Since when?
332,Rachel,What?
333,Ross,That's not a thing!
334,Rachel,Babies don't care if they're slim.
335,Ross,"Amy, I ju..."
336,Ross,I just...
337,Ross,I just wanna...
338,Ross,No more falafel for you!
339,Phoebe,"Uhuh, uhuh..."
340,Phoebe,I'm not.
341,Phoebe,I'm praying.
342,Phoebe,Please let the Knicks win...
343,Phoebe,Thank    you Thor!
344,Phoebe,Where... where are you going?
345,Phoebe,"Well, I think you should wait."
346,Phoebe,"Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the    nutrients."
347,Phoebe,Mike Hannigan... will you marry me?
348,Phoebe,That's not very enlightened!
349,Phoebe,"Hey, hey!"
350,Phoebe,Boo us?
351,Phoebe,Boo you!
352,Joey,Hello?
353,Joey,"Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani...    Oh, hi!"
354,Joey,"Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home    right now..."
355,Joey,"Okay, bye bye."
356,Joey,She was    nice!
357,Rachel,"Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!"
358,Joey,Whoo-hoo!
359,Rachel,You put holes in my baby's ears!
360,Rachel,I can't believe I ever even tried to help   you.
361,Rachel,You are so  beyond help.
362,Rachel,Excuse me?
363,Rachel,"Joey, where are those bags?"
364,Joey,She has a lot of crap!
365,Rachel,Seriously?
366,Rachel,Hips or thighs?
367,Rachel,Oh!
368,Rachel,Oh my God!
369,Rachel,I thought she was on Atkins.
370,Rachel,"Oh, I can give you that."
371,Rachel,Yeah.
372,Rachel,"I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're...    you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are."
373,Rachel,Did you just say Emma?
374,Phoebe,That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking    about.
375,Phoebe,"Mike, obviously you have balls."
376,Phoebe,I would love it.
377,Phoebe,Consider    it forgotten...
378,Phoebe,"But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose,    I promise I'll say yes."
379,Phoebe,"Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball    game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who    hides it in the cake."
380,Phoebe,"It's in the cake, isn't it?"
381,Phoebe,What's the matter with me?
382,Phoebe,How do I keep ruining this?
383,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, I'm    sorry!"
384,Phoebe,Oh my God!
385,Phoebe,Wait!
386,Phoebe,Oh wait!
387,Phoebe,Oh no!
388,Phoebe,Uh-huh!
389,Phoebe,Yes!
390,Phoebe,I love you more!
391,Rachel,So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?
392,Rachel,That's shocking!
