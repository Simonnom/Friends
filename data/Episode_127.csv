46,Ross,I know!
47,Ross,"Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer!"
48,Ross,"I mean it's temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job."

66,Chandler,Yeah?
67,Phoebe,"Well, she told me that I'm gonna die this week, so I'm kinda bummed about that."
68,Chandler,What?
69,Phoebe,"Yeah, and I know you guys don't know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get."
70,Monica,Phoebe that's crazy!
71,Joey,I can't believe she would say that too you.
72,Rachel,Yeah honey you don't believe her do you?
73,Phoebe,I don'tshe said y'know that I'd have triplets!
74,Phoebe,But she also said one of them would be black.
75,Chandler,Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you're gonna go?
76,Phoebe,"No, cause she didn't tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there!"
77,Phoebe,"I mean I've only got a week left, y'know?"
78,Phoebe,I've really gotta start living now!
79,Phoebe,", leans back, and starts reading.)"

81,Chandler,Oh hi!
82,Ross,"Hey uh, well, today's my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?"

85,Phoebe,"Oh, this is it."
86,Phoebe,This what's gonna kill me.
87,Ross,"""subcategories."
88,Ross,"The first of these subcategories is"""

90,Joey,"Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?"
91,Ross,No!
92,Ross,Why?
93,Joey,"Well, I've just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn't have naked chicks on it."
94,Ross,Ohh!
95,Ross,Okay!
96,Ross,Okay.
97,Ross,"""There are three  primary theories concerning sediment flow rate."
98,Ross,"Each of these theories  can be further subcategorized  into"""
99,Chandler,Why don't you open with a joke?
100,Ross,Open with a joke?
101,Ross,"It's a university, not a comedy club!"
102,Chandler,"Wait a minute, hold the phone!"
103,Chandler,You're not talking about Chuckles University?
104,Ross,Okay!
105,Rachel,"Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?"
106,Ross,Thank you!
107,Rachel,"Some uh, some visual aides."
108,Joey,Oh-ooh-ooh!
109,Joey,Y'know what's a good visual aide?
110,Ross,Please don't say naked chicks.
111,Joey,Why not?
112,Ross,I-I-I don't even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it.
113,Ross,Y'know what?
114,Ross,I'm just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
115,Chandler,That's the way I did it til I was 19.
116,Chandler,Hey.
117,Joey,Hey!
118,Joey,Any good mail?
119,Chandler,"Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild."
120,Joey,"Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda."
121,Chandler,"""Benefits lapsed."""
122,Joey,Hmm that's weird.
123,Joey,I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
124,Chandler,"Okay, it's not a check."
125,Chandler,"They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year."
126,Joey,Let me see that!
127,Chandler,All right.
128,Joey,"Oh, I can't believe this!"
129,Joey,This sucks!
130,Joey,"When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know?"
131,Joey,And it wouldn't matter.
132,Joey,Now I gotta be careful?
133,Chandler,"I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to  stop catching on fire."
134,Joey,"All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job."
135,Joey,I'm gonna go see my agent.
136,Chandler,"Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street."
137,Joey,look both ways before you cross the street.
138,Phoebe,Hey!
139,Rachel,"Hey Pheebs, you're still alive!"
140,Rachel,How are you doing?
141,Phoebe,"Ugh, it's so exhausting waiting for death."
142,Phoebe,"Ohh, by the way, do you think you could"
143,Rachel,"Pheebs, what-what are you doing?"
144,Phoebe,I was preparing you for mydidn't you think I was dead?
145,Phoebe,Did that not come off?
146,Rachel,"Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me."
147,Rachel,I thought we'd lost you forever.
148,Rachel,"Pheebs, you lie down?"
149,Phoebe,"Yeah, thanks."
150,Phoebe,"And listen, can you do me a favor?"
151,Phoebe,"Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y'know if you can."
152,Rachel,Monica!
153,Monica,Hmm?
154,Rachel,Did-did you take these back?
155,Monica,"No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself."
156,Rachel,"Oh yeah, they're really great!"
157,Rachel,Aren't they?
158,Monica,I loved them!
159,Rachel,Yeah.
160,Rachel,Nice try!
161,Ross,Hello!
162,Monica,Hey!
163,Rachel,Hey!
164,Monica,How'd the lecture go?
165,Ross,It went great!
166,Ross,And I didn't need any jokes or naked chicks either!
167,Rachel,"Wow, that's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before."
168,Ross,I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself.
169,Ross,"Everyone's all, ""Ross you have to be funny and sexy."""
170,Ross,"Well, I proved them wrong!"
171,Ross,"And now, I'm gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler."
172,Monica,That you're not funny or sexy?
173,Ross,That's right!
174,Joey,"Hey Estelle, listen"
175,Joey,What are you talkin' about?
176,Joey,I never left you!
177,Joey,You've always been my agent!
178,Joey,Yeah!
179,Joey,"Estelle, you gotta get me some work."
180,Joey,I-I lost my health insurance.
181,Joey,Why?
182,Joey,Bastard!
183,Chandler,Hey!
184,Joey,Hey!
185,Joey,So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I'll have my health insurance back in no time.
186,Chandler,"That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?"
187,Joey,What?
188,Chandler,What's wrong with you?
189,Joey,Nothing!
190,Joey,"Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since."
191,Joey,"But um, I don't think it's anything serious."
192,Chandler,This sounds like a hernia.
193,Chandler,You have toyou-you go to the doctor!
194,Joey,No way!
195,Joey,"Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!"
196,Chandler,That's a hernia.
197,Joey,Why did I have to start working out again?
198,Joey,Damn you 15s!
199,Rachel,"Well, we're a little early, the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes."
200,Monica,"Yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch."
201,Rachel,"Yeah, we could."
202,Rachel,Oh hey look!
203,Rachel,There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas!
204,Rachel,I was a Kappa.
205,Rachel,Hey sisters!
206,Rachel,"Wow, we really are bitches."
207,Ross,Right!
208,Ross,So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery!
209,Ross,"What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary."
210,Ross,Imagine his consternation when Oh bloody hell.
211,Ross,Commercial Break
212,Monica,What the hell are you doing?
213,Ross,"Look, I was nervous!"
214,Ross,You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring!
215,Ross,I got up there and they were all like staring at me.
216,Ross,I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
217,Rachel,"Yeah, and not a very good one."
218,Ross,Will you-will you please?

226,Monica,"Oh, you can have an accent and I can't?!"
227,Monica,Top O the morning to ya laddies!
228,Ross,Just please stop!
229,Rachel,"Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year."
230,Chandler,"Hey, will you grab me a cruller?"
231,Chandler,Sit down!
232,Chandler,Will you go to the hospital?
233,Joey,Dude!
234,Joey,"Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably."
235,Joey,"Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing."
236,Chandler,I will loan you the money.
237,Chandler,Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thingpushed back in.
238,Joey,"Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don't want that hanging over my head."
239,Joey,Okay?
240,Joey,"Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want!"
241,Joey,"Yeah, I'm thinking I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery too."
242,Phoebe,Hey!
243,Chandler,Hey.
244,Joey,Hey!
245,Phoebe,What's going on?
246,Chandler,"Oh Joey's got a really bad hernia, but that's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix!"
247,Joey,"Look, I'm telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here  it doesn't hurt that bad."
248,Phoebe,Hey!
249,Phoebe,Maybe you'll die!
250,Joey,"Sure, now I'm scared."
251,Phoebe,"No, we can go together!"
252,Phoebe,"Just don't wait too long though, okay?"
253,Phoebe,Cause I'm outta here sometime before Friday.
254,Joey,"Yeah, but I don't wanna die!"

264,Rachel,Yeah that seems fair.
265,Rachel,We never use them.
266,Ross,"Look, I really need some help, okay?"
267,Ross,Why?
268,Ross,Why did I have to speak in a British accent?!
269,Ross,What do I do?
270,Rachel,Well
271,Monica,Why don't you phase it out?
272,Monica,"Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you're, y'know, that you're adjusting to life in America."
273,Rachel,"Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice."
274,Rachel,I mean they're probably not even listening!
275,Ross,They're not listening too me?
276,Rachel,Of course they're listening to you!
277,Rachel,Everybody listens to you.
278,Ross,Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
