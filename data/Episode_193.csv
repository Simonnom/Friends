40,Phoebe,Don't be worried about that!
41,Phoebe,Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say!
42,Phoebe,"It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage!"
43,Phoebe,Y'know?
44,Phoebe,"Mine's gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive."
45,Ross,"Look, all I know is I-I can't have another failed marriage!"

49,Phoebe,Sorry.
50,Ross,"Well, okay so, I don't have it all worked out quite yet."
51,Ross,"Just don't say anything to Rachel, please?"
52,Phoebe,Rachel is one of my closest friends.

72,Chandler,"When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict."
73,Monica,"Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?"
74,Chandler,"No, no, I keep trying, y'know?"
75,Chandler,"I can get out, ""Joey, I have too"" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, ""go to the bathroom."""

151,Phoebe,"So you'll been divorced three times, you'll still have a life, you'll go on dates"
152,Ross,No!

154,Ross,I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now.

156,Phoebe,"Ross, you're being ridiculous!"
157,Phoebe,Okay?
158,Phoebe,You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
159,Ross,Oh yeah?
160,Ross,Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
161,Phoebe,Y'know that's really fair.
162,Phoebe,Y'know?
163,Phoebe,Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60.
164,Phoebe,"Ross, nobody cares about this except you!"
165,Phoebe,This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head!
166,Phoebe,"Here, I'll show you!"

191,Chandler,"Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap."
192,Chandler,Seriously.
193,Rachel,I believe you.
194,Rachel,"So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel!"
195,Rachel,"By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!"
196,Chandler,"Well, I-I still think you're very-very nice and very pretty"
197,Rachel,What?
198,Chandler,All yours babe.
199,Monica,Have a seat.

217,Ross,"Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault."
218,Ross,"Third marriage, well they really shouldn't allow you to get married when you're that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada's fault."
219,Phoebe,"Okay, so what do you think ladies?"
220,Phoebe,Who wouldn't be interested?
221,Phoebe,Who wouldn't want to date him?
222,Phoebe,"Okay, what about you?"
223,Phoebe,Wouldn't you want a date?
224,Phoebe,Whatever!
225,Phoebe,What about you Meg?
226,Ross,What?
227,Phoebe,"She said, ""He's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl."""

230,Ross,"Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?"
231,Phoebe,"Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her."
232,Ross,We were drunk!
233,Ross,"I would've married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!"
234,Phoebe,Hey!
235,Phoebe,You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!
236,Ross,"Look, I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong."
237,Ross,I just don't want to be divorced three times.
238,Phoebe,"Yes, and now he's using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her."

240,Phoebe,Bravo Meg.
241,Ross,Okay!

253,Monica,"I couldn't do that to her, she's my best friend!"
254,Chandler,"Well, Joey's my best friend."
255,Monica,I'm not your best friend?
256,Chandler,You just said Of course you're my best friend.

272,Monica,I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
273,Rachel,Um-hmm.
274,Monica,"Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together."
275,Rachel,Oh my God!

294,Joey,No more J and C's.

296,Joey,"""Can't, its not there."""
297,Chandler,"Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff."
298,Joey,Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
299,Chandler,Not once did we do that.
300,Monica,Hi.
301,Chandler,Hey!
302,Joey,Hi.

306,Monica,Really well.
307,Monica,Yeah.
308,Monica,Surprisingly well.
309,Monica,"Yeah, she didn't cry."
310,Monica,She wasn't angry or sad.
311,Chandler,And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
312,Monica,"I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion!"
313,Monica,Is that too much to ask after six years?!
314,Monica,I mean what?
315,Monica,Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?!
316,Monica,I mean do we not have as much fun?!
317,Monica,Don't I deserve a few tears?!!

329,Ross,Yes-yes-yes!
330,Ross,"But, I-I do not love her."
331,Ross,This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
332,Ross,I think just the annulment for today.
333,Ross,Easy.
334,Ross,No problem.
335,Ross,Ooh!
336,Ross,There's no way to do this without her?
337,Ross,"Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of."
338,Ross,"Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel?"
339,Ross,I will think about the therapy.
340,Rachel,Hey!
341,Monica,Hey.
342,Monica,"So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff."
343,Rachel,Okay!
344,Monica,"Y'know, no point in dragging it out."
345,Monica,Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
346,Rachel,Okay.
347,Monica,"Hey Rach, what about this?"
348,Monica,Huh?
349,Monica,Who-who gets this?
350,Monica,"See, I don't know if I want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!"
351,Rachel,What the hell is that?
352,Monica,I don't know.
353,Monica,"Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate?"
354,Monica,I want you to have the big plate.
355,Rachel,Wow!
356,Rachel,"Mon, thanks!"
357,Rachel,I love this plate!
358,Monica,Something to remember me by!
359,Rachel,"Mon, honey you're not dying."
360,Rachel,I'm just moving out.
361,Rachel,"Y'know, I mean we're gonna see each other all the time."
362,Monica,"But still, it's a big change."
363,Monica,"The end of an era, you might say!"
364,Rachel,Are you okay?
365,Rachel,You're not blinking.
366,Monica,I'm fine!
367,Monica,"I just, I'm thinking how much it's an end of era."
368,Rachel,"Oh, all right."
369,Rachel,"But y'know I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years counts as an era."
370,Monica,An era is defined as a significant period of time.
371,Monica,"Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!"
372,Rachel,What is the matter with you?
373,Monica,What is the matter with you?!!
374,Monica,Why aren't you more upset?!
375,Monica,Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?!
376,Monica,I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?
377,Rachel,"All right, fine, but don't get mad at me."
378,Rachel,It's-it's just a little hard to believe.
379,Monica,What's hard to believe?
380,Rachel,"Well y'know, it's you guys."
381,Rachel,You-you do this kind of stuff!
382,Rachel,Y'know?
383,Rachel,"I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out!"
384,Rachel,I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you guys going through with it.
385,Rachel,I'm sorry.
386,Monica,"Rachel, it's going to happen."
387,Monica,Chandler is gonna move in here.
388,Rachel,But I
389,Monica,"No-no, wait!"
390,Monica,"Just let me finish, okay?"
391,Monica,"This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want."
392,Monica,And it is going to happen.
393,Rachel,It is?
394,Rachel,Really?
395,Monica,"Yeah, sweetie."
396,Rachel,"I mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore?"
397,Monica,No.
398,Rachel,What?
399,Rachel,Oh my God!
400,Rachel,I'm gonna miss you so much!
401,Monica,I'm gonna miss you!

403,Monica,I know!
404,Phoebe,"Okay, bye!"
405,Ross,Oh no.
406,Phoebe,So?
407,Phoebe,Did you get the annulment?
408,Ross,I couldn't.
409,Phoebe,I knew it!
410,Phoebe,Because you love Rachel.
411,Ross,It's not that.
412,Ross,Okay?
413,Ross,Annulments are more complicated than I
414,Phoebe,"Yeah, complicated cause of the love."
415,Ross,"I I do, I do not love Rachel."
416,Ross,I'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible.
417,Ross,Okay?
418,Ross,Would I do that if I loved her?
419,Phoebe,I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
420,Ross,I do not have feelings for Rachel!
421,Ross,Okay?
422,Ross,"Ohh, what's wrong?"
423,Rachel,Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
424,Ross,Oh myCome here!
425,Ross,Come here!
426,Ross,It's okay.

435,Phoebe,"Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way."
436,Phoebe,Yeah.
437,Phoebe,But it won't work out.
438,Joey,Wow.
439,Phoebe,I know.
440,Phoebe,"Then, I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money and you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids."
441,Joey,Great!
442,Phoebe,But then we ditch those two and that's when we get married.
443,Phoebe,We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.

445,Phoebe,"I don't want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him."
