88,Chandler,Oh that's so funny because we found someone too.
89,Phoebe,"Oh that's good, I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo."
90,Chandler,Why would our guy be a weirdo?
91,Phoebe,Cause that's just your taste.
92,Monica,Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.
93,Phoebe,Oh yeah?
94,Monica,Yeah!
95,Phoebe,My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work.
96,Phoebe,"And, he has one of these"
97,Chandler,A face ass?

101,Chandler,"No, our guy is just a floating head."
102,Phoebe,Well my guy is spectacular.
103,Phoebe,Okay?
104,Phoebe,"He's a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it."
105,Phoebe,And I mean all of it.

107,Phoebe,"Oh yeah, like there are police for that!"
108,Chandler,Wait!
109,Chandler,You look?
110,Chandler,You-you massaged me.

123,Joey,The fridge broke.
124,Joey,I have to eat everything.
125,Joey,"Cold cuts, ice cream, limesHey, what was in that brown jar?"
126,Chandler,That's still in there?
127,Joey,Not anymore.
128,Joey,"So anyway, how do you want to pay me?"
129,Chandler,Is this a service you're providing me?
130,Joey,No!
131,Joey,No!
132,Joey,No!
133,Joey,For my new fridgeour new fridge!

156,Ross,You don't understand!
157,Ross,Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her!
158,Ross,Is that taking it slow?!
159,Ross,"No, I'm not ready for this!"
160,Ross,Okay?
161,Ross,What-what do I tell her?
162,Chandler,Just tell her the truth!
163,Chandler,Tell her you're not ready.
164,Ross,I can do that.
165,Ross,"Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?"
166,Chandler,Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
167,Joey,Or!
168,Joey,"You can just, y'know"
169,Ross,What the hell are you doing?
170,Joey,What?

183,Ross,"Joey, I did not break this!"
184,Ross,Okay?
185,Ross,That has been broken for a while.
186,Joey,All right.
187,Joey,"Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?"
188,Chandler,Uh-huh.
189,Joey,I still haven't gotten a check for your half yet.
190,Ross,Do not give him any money!
191,Joey,I'm not talking to you!
192,Joey,You broke my fridge!
193,Ross,Yes.
194,Ross,Yes!
195,Ross,"Please, come in."
196,Ross,Oo-oo!
197,Ross,"Yeah, it kinda grows on you."
198,Ross,"Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation."
199,Ross,"Look, I  Look, I'm having a great time with you and I just don't want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us."
200,Ross,"So, I'm sorry I just don't think we should go away together yet."
201,Ross,It's-it's too soon.
202,Ross,No.
203,Ross,I think you misunderstood what I was saying.

211,Monica,How did it go with Elizabeth?
212,Ross,Huh?
213,Ross,"Oh-oh, it was fine."
214,Ross,"Uh, it was just a misunderstanding."
215,Ross,She didn't want me to go with her.
216,Ross,She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.
217,Chandler,"Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?"
218,Ross,What's-what's the difference?
219,Monica,"Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents."
220,Monica,Spring break you're doing frat guys.
221,Ross,"Hey, y'know what?"
222,Ross,Not all spring breaks are like that.
223,Phoebe,What did you do on yours?
224,Ross,I went to Egypt with my dad.
225,Chandler,"I can see it now, ""Look dad, it's the Sphinx!"""
226,Ross,"Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, ""Spring break!"""
227,Ross,All right?
228,Ross,I mean she's taken my class!
229,Monica,And slept with the professor.
230,Ross,I'm gonna call her.
231,Chandler,Yeah.
232,Rachel,Hey!
233,Rachel,"You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian."
234,Rachel,"We just uh, we just met at the newsstand."

236,Rachel,What?
237,Rachel,I read that.
238,Rachel,Oh yes!
239,Rachel,Thank you!
240,Phoebe,"Rachel, what the hell is this?"
241,Rachel,What?
242,Phoebe,You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!
243,Rachel,You found me a guy?
244,Monica,Yes!
245,Monica,We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler's work!
246,Phoebe,Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
247,Rachel,"Well, y'know what though you guys?"
248,Rachel,I really appreciate that but I think I'm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
249,Chandler,Are you sure?!
250,Chandler,Because our guy smells incredible!
251,Monica,"Uh, would you stop it with that already?"
252,Rachel,"Oh, thank you."
253,Phoebe,"So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?"
254,Phoebe,"No reason, it's just I know a single guy that cares about other people."
255,Chandler,Are you funny?
256,Rachel,What are you guys doing?
257,Monica,Are you funny?
258,Monica,Tell us a joke!
259,Phoebe,"Well, so do a lot of people."
260,Rachel,"Oh, but y'know, no, you didn't give me your phone number."
261,Chandler,Turns out he is kinda funny.
262,Chandler,Commercial Break
263,Rachel,I cannot believe you guys!
264,Rachel,He was really nice and he left because of you!
265,Chandler,"Yeah, but Sebastian?"
266,Chandler,What is that?
267,Chandler,A cat's name?
268,Phoebe,"Yeah, y'know what I noticed Rachel?"
269,Phoebe,He scares easy.
270,Phoebe,Is that the kind of guy you'd like to take to a ball?
271,Phoebe,"""Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?"""
272,Phoebe,"""Uhh, okayI gotta go!"""
273,Monica,All right guys stop it.
274,Monica,"Rachel, we're very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do."
275,Monica,And y'know what?
276,Monica,"Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you."
277,Phoebe,Yeah!
278,Phoebe,What have you got to lose?
279,Phoebe,Y'know you might even end up with someone really special  if you pick my guy.
280,Rachel,All right.
281,Chandler,"Okay, so you will meet our guys?"
282,Rachel,"Yes, I'll meet em."
283,Chandler,"Okay now it doesn't matter which one you choose, y'know?"
284,Chandler,It's completely up to you.
285,Chandler,"Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself."
286,Joey,Pheebs!
287,Joey,There you are!
288,Joey,"Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!"
289,Phoebe,Okay sure!
290,Joey,Really?
291,Phoebe,"Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions."
292,Joey,Call it even?
293,Phoebe,Okay.
294,Chandler,"Well, there you are!"
295,Chandler,So what did Elizabeth say?
296,Ross,"Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo."
297,Ross,"That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl's bodies, waking up next to people you don't even know"
298,Joey,"Man, she is going to have a great time!"
299,Joey,Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
300,Chandler,You know the hotels?
301,Joey,Sure!
302,Joey,I was there!
303,Joey,Spring Break '81!

306,Joey,So what?
307,Joey,"I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast."
308,Joey,And y'know who knows how to party?
309,Joey,Drunk college chicks.
310,Ross,"Okay, she can't go."
311,Phoebe,"Ross, you can't tell her not to go."
312,Phoebe,You just started dating.
313,Ross,Then what am I supposed to do?
314,Phoebe,"Nothing, you just have to be cool with it."
315,Ross,"Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?"
316,Chandler,"Well, maybe you don't marry this one."
317,Ross,I'm so glad you're going on this trip!
318,Ross,Sure.
319,Ross,Sure.
320,Ross,"Look I don't, I don't know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam."
321,Ross,Are you into crafts at all?
322,Ross,"Well, yeah, of-of course I'm okay!"
323,Ross,What?
324,Ross,I'm just being supportive.
325,Ross,"Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and  what-what is uh, what's this?"

404,Rachel,I'll tell ya who should be embarrassed!
405,Rachel,It's you guys!
406,Rachel,Come on!
407,Rachel,This is ridiculous!
408,Rachel,"Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!"
409,Phoebe,Then why did she ask us to
410,Rachel,I am still talking!!

412,Rachel,"I mean, no offense to you guys."
413,Rachel,Really!
414,Rachel,"I mean  congratulations on all the cash,  and-and y'knowWow!"

417,Rachel,Good-bye!
418,Rachel,Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?
419,Rachel,Thank you!
420,Ross,"So uh, have a great time down there."

423,Ross,"It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh?"
424,Ross,"Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it's revealing which I'm fine with, no I'm concerned about your health, sun exposure."
425,Ross,"Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30."
426,Ross,"I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's-it's get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it's just milk."
