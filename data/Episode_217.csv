14,Monica,OPENING CREDITS
15,Phoebe,I know!
16,Phoebe,"Yeah, I kinda do."
17,Phoebe,"Well,    how's this?"
18,Joey,"Aaahhh, look    at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious?"
19,Joey,Have you not talked about it yet?
20,Joey,Am I making you uncomfortable?
21,Joey,"If you were bigger you'd hit me,    huh...?"
22,Joey,Aaaaaahhhhhh
23,Phoebe,I'm sorry...
24,Phoebe,I'm sorry.
25,Phoebe,It's obviously way too early    for us to be... having that conversation.
26,Phoebe,"Maybe not, is it?"
27,Phoebe,"I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?"
28,Phoebe,"Oh, it's a key."
29,Phoebe,"To be honest, I think I'd prefer the    five dollars."
30,Phoebe,"Oh wow, ooh!"
31,Phoebe,"Ooh, big step for    Phoebe and Mike."
32,Phoebe,"Oh no, I want to."
33,Phoebe,Yeah... ooh... wow...
34,Phoebe,"Even started to think I'd never    meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with."
35,Phoebe,Here you go.
36,Phoebe,It really is.
37,Joey,"Oh, I know it..."
38,Joey,It    is amazing these little things open doors... huh!
39,Rachel,"So I don't go back to work for another four weeks,    but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance    to know her."
40,Rachel,Prospective
41,Rachel,"That's great, great."
42,Rachel,So do you have any questions    for us?
43,Rachel,Prospective
44,Rachel,Allright.
45,Rachel,Well thank you so much for coming...
46,Ross,Thank you.
47,Rachel,Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.
48,Rachel,Prospective
49,Ross,"Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that."
50,Ross,Prospective
51,Rachel,Okidoki!
52,Rachel,Wow!
53,Rachel,We're never gonna find a nanny.
54,Ross,"Oh, come on Rach, we will."
55,Ross,I promise.
56,Ross,"We have more interviews     And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider    the uhm... the first one we met with."
57,Rachel,"What, the blonde with no bra?"
58,Ross,She was blonde?
59,Ross,Just a sec.!
60,Ross,"Okay, okay."
61,Ross,This one's name is Sandy.
62,Ross,"She's got a degree    in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three    years."
63,Rachel,Okay...
64,Ross,And she's a little mannish...
65,Phoebe,Oh my God!
66,Phoebe,David!
67,Phoebe,No!
68,Phoebe,"It's a great time, come in...!"
69,Phoebe,"WOW,    hi... Oh my gosh!"
70,Phoebe,What are you doing here?
71,Phoebe,Are you back from Minsk?
72,Phoebe,"Who cares, it got you here."
73,Phoebe,Wow.
74,Phoebe,Where is your luggage?
75,Phoebe,"A-Allright, well..."
76,Phoebe,I'll call the cab company.
77,Phoebe,Thank you!
78,Phoebe,"God, no!"
79,Phoebe,"You should see me when... Oh actually,    no, I look pretty good."
80,Phoebe,No...
81,Phoebe,I'm...
82,Phoebe,I'm just...
83,Phoebe,I'm the worst person ever.
84,Phoebe,How    can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?
85,Monica,Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
86,Phoebe,He
87,Monica,"Oh, well... That had been your window."
88,Phoebe,Yeah!
89,Phoebe,"I mean, I don't know."
90,Phoebe,"I was just , I was looking,    I was looking in his eyes and I was just"
91,Monica,Really?
92,Monica,The scientist guy?
93,Phoebe,Really?
94,Phoebe,Chandler?
95,Monica,Continue...
96,Phoebe,"Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him    that I would see him tomorrow night."
97,Monica,Phoebe!
98,Phoebe,I know!
99,Phoebe,Evil!
100,Phoebe,And... and... and...
101,Phoebe,"I like Mike so much, you know."
102,Phoebe,It's just going really well.
103,Phoebe,Oh my God!
104,Monica,"Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the    same day that you and Mike exchange keys?"
105,Phoebe,Uhuh...
106,Phoebe,"Yeah...!, you know."
107,Phoebe,"And given    my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am."
108,Monica,What are you gonna do?
109,Phoebe,"I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that    nothing can happen between us."
110,Phoebe,"Unless I don't... You know, complicated    moral situation, no right, no wrong..."
111,Monica,You have to tell David!
112,Phoebe,"Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation    with Joey."
113,Chandler,Funniest guy she's ever met!
114,Chandler,"I'm funny, right...?"
115,Chandler,"What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock    jokes...  Save it for    inside!"
116,Monica,Heeeeeey!
117,Chandler,Hey!
118,Phoebe,Hey!
119,Chandler,So... Oklahoma is a crazy place.
120,Chandler,"You know, they    call it the Sooner state."
121,Chandler,Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state.
122,Chandler,And what's with Oklahoma    having a pan handle?
123,Chandler,Can all states have stuff like that?
124,Chandler,"Hey yeah, I'm from    the waistband, Wyoming."
125,Chandler,"But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch."
126,Monica,Was your cabin    pressurised?
127,Chandler,And don't get    me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.
128,Phoebe,Okay.
129,Chandler,What's with the word y'all?
130,Chandler,"You know, just... two    words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so,    I say why stop there?"
131,Chandler,"You know, your new poodle could be your noodle."
132,Chandler,And fried    chicken?
133,Chandler,"Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken?"
134,Chandler,"See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?"
135,Monica,"No, it just remind me of something this guy did today    at work."
136,Monica,"I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?"
137,Chandler,"Yeah, he came up..."
138,Monica,"Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there,    but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken."
139,Chandler,Were you there?
140,Phoebe,"No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny..."
141,Rachel,"Sandy, that's exactly what it is..."
142,Ross,Are you gay?
143,Rachel,Ross!
144,Rachel,Oh!
145,Rachel,"Oh, that's pretty."
146,Ross,So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?
147,Ross,Okay.
148,Ross,"Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap."
149,Rachel,"Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed."
150,Rachel,"Oh, that would be great!"
151,Rachel,"I love him, I love him, I love him..."
152,Ross,"Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!"
153,Rachel,So wh..?
154,Rachel,"He's smart, he's qualified."
155,Rachel,Give me one good    reason we shouldn't try him out.
156,Ross,"Because, it's weird!"
157,Rachel,Why?
158,Ross,What kind of job is that for a man?
159,Ross,A nanny?
160,Ross,I-It's    like if a woman wanted to be...
161,Rachel,Yes?
162,Ross,King?
163,Rachel,Please?
164,Rachel,YES!
165,Rachel,Sandy you're hired.
166,Rachel,Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.
167,Ross,You gotta be at least bi... COMMERCIAL BREAK
168,Chandler,Hey!
169,Chandler,I need you to set me up for a joke.
170,Chandler,"Later, when Monica    is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks."
171,Joey,Ooh.
172,Joey,I-I don't know Chan.
173,Joey,I'm not so good with remembering    lines.
174,Chandler,"Well, thank God your    livelihood doesn't depend on it."
175,Joey,"I know, right?"
176,Joey,Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?
177,Chandler,Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy    she's ever met.
178,Joey,Seriously?
179,Joey,She actually said that?
180,Chandler,Yes!
181,Chandler,Am I crazy to be this upset?
182,Joey,Nooooo!
183,Joey,Being funny is your thing!
184,Chandler,Yeah!
185,Joey,"Without that, you just got ""lame with women""."
186,Chandler,Ye....
187,Monica,Hi!
188,Monica,There you are.
189,Joey,Fire trucks!
190,Phoebe,Oof...
191,Phoebe,"Oh, wait, wait!"
192,Phoebe,"No, no, it's not that."
193,Phoebe,Uhm...
194,Phoebe,Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no?
195,Phoebe,"Well,    uhm..."
196,Phoebe,I am.
197,Phoebe,His ... his name is Mike.
198,Phoebe,"Yeah, I should have told you."
199,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
200,Phoebe,I am happy.
201,Phoebe,"Well... but David, just..."
202,Phoebe,I just want you to know    that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things    I've ever had to do.
203,Phoebe,"Of course, yeah."
204,Phoebe,"You know, a kiss    on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate..."
205,Phoebe,I mean...
206,Phoebe,Yeah?
207,Phoebe,"Well, if that's what they do in Minsk..."
208,Phoebe,In New York...    it's...
209,Rachel,Oh... Oh boy...  Hi...
210,Ross,Is everything allright?
211,Rachel,"Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine."
212,Rachel,Sandy was just... was    just telling me about how he proposed to his fianc√©e and it was just    sooo beautiful.
213,Rachel,I can't...
214,Rachel,I can't hear it again.
215,Ross,"And I'm fine never having heard it...  Rach, can I... can I see    you for a sec?"
216,Rachel,Yeah!
217,Rachel,Excuse me...
218,Ross,Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three    times...?
219,Ross,Huh?
220,Ross,I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.
221,Rachel,"Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive,    that's all."
222,Ross,"Okay, okay, see... that... that    is the problem."
223,Ross,He is too sensitive.
224,Rachel,What...?
225,Rachel,Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
226,Ross,"Yeah, I mean, all things    that guy..."
227,Ross,These are amazing!
228,Rachel,Sandy made Madeleines.
229,Ross,This... this is exactly what I'm talking about.
230,Ross,"What    kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh?"
231,Ross,"They're not even...    butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks."
232,Rachel,"Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say..."
233,Rachel,"I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men."
234,Rachel,"You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in    from branding cattle."
235,Ross,Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
236,Rachel,"Okay, what?"
237,Rachel,What is too sensitive?
238,Phoebe,"Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this."
239,Phoebe,It's bad.
240,Phoebe,"No, no."
241,Phoebe,No.
242,Phoebe,"Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah,    we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with    Mike and I really care about him..."
243,Phoebe,And you thanks for the    face massage.
244,Phoebe,Thank you.
245,Ross,Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?
246,Monica,Yeah!
247,Monica,I think that's great!
248,Ross,Oh really?
249,Ross,"Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites    poetry and bakes Madeleines?"
250,Monica,Oh... How are they?
251,Ross,Lighter than air...
252,Ross,But that's not the point.
253,Joey,Hey!
254,Ross,Hey...!
255,Ross,Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
256,Joey,Really...?
257,Joey,Guys do that...?
258,Joey,That's...    weird...
259,Ross,Thank you!
260,Joey,That's like a woman wanting to be a...
261,Ross,...a what?
262,Ross,A what?
263,Ross,What's the end of that sentence?
264,Monica,Yes... What is the end of that sentence?
265,Joey,Uhm... A penis model.
266,Joey,"Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler    that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?"
267,Monica,"Yeah, so?"
268,Ross,Wow!
269,Joey,Really?
270,Joey,Do you not know Chandler?
271,Monica,Is that why he's acting so weird...?
272,Monica,He's jealous...?
273,Monica,"Oh my God, that is crazy."
274,Monica,It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...
275,Joey,So what?
276,Joey,"Being funny is Chandler's thing...    You know, like Ross's thing is..."
277,Ross,Science...?
278,Ross,Academia...?
279,Ross,Being a good father...?
280,Joey,...No...
281,Monica,I can't believe he's that upset about this...
282,Joey,"Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay."
283,Joey,'Cause he's feeling like...
284,Chandler,Hey!
285,Joey,Heeeyy!
286,Joey,Hey!
287,Chandler,What are you guys talking about?
288,Ross,Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
289,Chandler,You got a man who's a nanny...?
290,Chandler,You got a manny...?
291,Chandler,"You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do    draw the line at a male wetnurse."
292,Monica,"Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!"
293,Chandler,"If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would    have brought more pizza."
294,Monica,"Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it!"
295,Chandler,What is so funny about that?
296,Monica,"Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say    it..."
297,Monica,"I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing."
298,Monica,You're a funny guy!
299,Chandler,Did you tell her what we talked about?
300,Joey,Yeah....
301,Chandler,So those were pity laughs?
302,Chandler,PITY LAUGHS?
303,Monica,"Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with    Geoffrey."
304,Chandler,Oh yeah?
305,Chandler,Is he funnier than me?
306,Monica,"Well, you're... you're different funny..."
307,Monica,"I mean,    you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions...    and... and limericks..."
308,Chandler,I do limericks... uhm...
309,Chandler,"There once was a man named    Chandler, whose wife made him die inside."
310,Monica,"Honey, you know I think you're hilarious!"
311,Monica,"Come on,    you know that joke you told me last week?"
312,Monica,The one about Jerry Lewis and the    girl with the lazy eye...?
313,Monica,That slayed me.
314,Ross,Hey...
315,Ross,I made up that joke and told it to you!
316,Joey,Not knowing when to shut up...
317,Ross,Yep!
318,Ross,That's my thing... COMMERCIAL BREAK
319,Phoebe,"No, no, no, no, no..."
320,Phoebe,It's not... it's not... i'ts    not as bad as it looks... really.
321,Phoebe,I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.
322,Phoebe,"No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years    ago, and he lives in Minsk."
323,Phoebe,He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days.
324,Phoebe,"No, no..."
325,Phoebe,"Oh, well, yeah..."
326,Phoebe,Stop it!
327,Phoebe,"Stop it, before someone gets really hurt!"
328,Phoebe,"Here David, you    should just go."
329,Phoebe,"Okay, well... guys?"
330,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry."
331,Phoebe,If you...
332,Phoebe,"If you want your    key back, I totally understand."
333,Phoebe,Right!
334,Phoebe,Never!
335,Phoebe,Never!
336,Phoebe,I swear!
337,Joey,Yeah!
338,Joey,Allright!
339,Joey,"Hey, hey Ross."
340,Joey,Check it out!
341,Joey,Sandy taught    me Hot-cross Buns.
342,Ross,Really?
343,Ross,Sounded like Three Blind Mice.
344,Joey,Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this...
345,Ross,I swear to    God...!
346,Joey,Me!
347,Joey,I'm up for puppets!
348,Ross,"Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed    to appreciate puppets?"
349,Joey,I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch.
350,Ross,Oh my God!
351,Rachel,That was kind of rude!
352,Ross,"Oh, I'm sorry."
353,Ross,Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps    for me.
354,Rachel,"You know, he was just doing his job..."
355,Ross,"Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one    who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there..."
356,Ross,But I just...
357,Ross,I can't...
358,Ross,I    can't go through with this.
359,Rachel,"Oh, come on Ross..."
360,Ross,No!
361,Ross,"Hey, you know what?"
362,Ross,I'm sorry.
363,Ross,I would never force    you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...
364,Rachel,Oh... That's true.
365,Ross,Thank you!
366,Rachel,"Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're    gonna have to do it."
367,Joey,I am learning so much from you.
368,Chandler,"Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend    has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com."
369,Monica,"Honey, you can relax."
370,Monica,"Last night at work, Geoffrey    told this really sexist joke."
371,Monica,"After that, not so funny anymore."
372,Chandler,Really...?
373,Chandler,See... that's the
374,Monica,"Okay, don't miss that flight."
375,Monica,You know I love you.
376,Chandler,I love you too.
377,Chandler,And...
378,Chandler,I like you as a friend.
379,Joey,Allright.
380,Joey,See you later!
381,Chandler,See ya!
382,Joey,Did that guy really make that joke?
383,Monica,Naaaa...
384,Monica,He still kills me.
385,Monica,"Last night he had me laughing    so hard, I swear... a little pee came out."
386,Ross,Here goes...
387,Rachel,I can't watch.
388,Rachel,It's like firing Elmo.
389,Ross,"Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk."
390,Ross,I'm afraid    it's not working out.
391,Ross,"Yeah, uhm..."
392,Ross,"I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great...    with Emma... uhm... We just feel..."
393,Rachel,YOU!
394,Rachel,You feel!
395,Ross,I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right.
396,Ross,I'm sorry.
397,Ross,We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...
398,Rachel,"Oh, damn you Geller!"
399,Ross,"Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings."
400,Ross,"No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's    uhm... my issue."
401,Ross,"You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with    a guy who's as sensitive as you."
402,Ross,Why...
403,Ross,I...
404,Ross,I don't know.
405,Ross,Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
406,Ross,"I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was    kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now."
407,Rachel,Huh ha ha!
408,Ross,I play squash...!
409,Ross,"Anyway, uhm..."
410,Ross,I uhm...
411,Ross,I always get    the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.
412,Ross,It was hard...
413,Ross,I remember...
414,Ross,"I was in my bedroom...    playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father    walks in and says... he says... ""What are you doing with those things?"
415,Ross,"What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like    a... like a real boy?"
416,Ross,I know I am!
417,Ross,"...And when it's    summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?"
418,Ross,Here come some more... COMMERCIAL BREAK
419,Joey,Wow!
