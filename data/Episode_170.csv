13,Chandler,"Okay, listen, you have to cheer up!"
14,Chandler,Okay?

46,Monica,Okay.
47,Monica,So what did you do today Pete?
48,Monica,What?!
49,Monica,Oh.
50,Monica,Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
51,Rachel,What a jerk!
52,Rachel,You want me to kick his ass?
53,Monica,I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery.
54,Monica,I mean I would kill for this job.
55,Monica,"I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues."
56,Monica,But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
57,Rachel,And you're still not attracted to him at all?
58,Monica,"Hmm, no."
59,Monica,I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him?
60,Monica,I-I-I-I can't.
61,Monica,I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
62,Rachel,"Yeah, but Mon that's totally different."
63,Rachel,He was you're health teacher.
64,Monica,"Oh, please."
65,Monica,What?
66,Monica,Honey.
67,Rachel,"Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday."
68,Monica,"Oh God, I'm so sorry."
69,Rachel,I know.
70,Rachel,Ow!
71,Monica,Oh God!
72,Ross,"Hey, you guys!"
73,Ross,Guess what?
74,Rachel,Got a job on a river boat?
75,Ross,Y'know what I didn't wear this suit for a year because you hated it.
76,Ross,"Well, guess what?"
77,Ross,You're not my girlfriend anymore so...
78,Rachel,"Oh I see, so this suit is making a point."
79,Ross,Right.
80,Rachel,"Now that you're on you're own, you're free to look as stupid as you like."
81,Ross,You like it right?
82,Monica,Oh absolutely.
83,Monica,I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.
84,Monica,Ross!
85,Monica,Ross!
86,Monica,I'm kidding!
87,Rachel,"Yeah, come here!"
88,Monica,What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
89,Rachel,Yeah.
90,Rachel,Oh!
91,Rachel,Was how you invented the cotton gin?
92,Ross,"Okay, good bye!"
93,Chandler,"So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen."
94,Phoebe,"Umm, oh, about three months."
95,Chandler,"Okay, so I guess that's about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in."
96,Joey,Hey!
97,Chandler,Hey!
98,Joey,I got you something!
99,Joey,Open it!
100,Joey,Open it!

105,Chandler,Fowl?
106,Chandler,No.
107,Chandler,Women?
108,Chandler,Nooo.
109,Phoebe,"Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age."
110,Phoebe,They require constant care.
111,Phoebe,"They-they need just the right food, and lot's and lot's of love."
112,Joey,"Oh, well no problem there."
113,Chandler,Easy Lenny.
114,Monica,Okay.
115,Monica,Here's the thing.
116,Monica,I can't do it.
117,Monica,"I'm sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me...."
118,Monica,Huh?
119,Monica,Oh?
120,Monica,"Oh, that's great!"
121,Monica,"I mean I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you."
122,Monica,And now I can work for you!
123,Monica,Oh my God!

132,Monica,I'm okay!!
133,Monica,I'm all right!
134,Phoebe,Wow!
135,Phoebe,"That's exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman."
136,Phoebe,"I'm just saying, this woman, I mean she's fictitious."
137,Phoebe,No?
138,Phoebe,혩Cause you're still into Monica.
139,Phoebe,"So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so 혩cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and..."
140,Phoebe,"Yeah, no, I'm fairly intuitive and psychic."
141,Phoebe,It's a substantial gift.
142,Phoebe,"Absolutely, oh I promise."
143,Phoebe,Tell her what?
144,Phoebe,No I'm serious.
145,Phoebe,"I mean I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks."
146,Chandler,"Okay, but this is the last time."
147,Chandler,"With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there."
148,Chandler,"Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen."
149,Joey,Hey.
150,Chandler,Hey.
151,Joey,How's she doing?
152,Chandler,She?
153,Joey,"Well yeah, don't-don't you think it's a she?"
154,Chandler,I don't know.
155,Chandler,"I can't tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly."
156,Joey,"Well, anyway, I got to go change, I'm ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks."
157,Chandler,Excuse me?
158,Joey,What?
159,Chandler,I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
160,Joey,Hey!
161,Joey,Who was up from 2 o'clock this morning until 5 o'clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
162,Chandler,You don't think I get up when you get up?
163,Joey,"Ohhh, here it comes."
164,Chandler,"Yes, here it comes!"
165,Chandler,"I'm stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends?"
166,Chandler,Well I don't think so mister!
167,Joey,Hey!!
168,Joey,I need to relax!
169,Joey,Okay?
170,Joey,I was working all day!
171,Chandler,And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?
172,Joey,That's not what I said.
173,Joey,"Okay, I just meant..."
174,Chandler,I know what you meant!!
175,Chandler,"You notice that ever since we got this chick, we've been fighting a lot more than we used too?"
176,Joey,"I don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick."
177,Chandler,I'll take her back tomorrow.
178,Joey,Do you think we'll get our three bucks back?
179,Ross,Hey!
180,Chandler,Hey!
181,Ross,"Ohhh, hey!"
182,Ross,"All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay?"
183,Ross,What do you think?
184,Ross,"This blue suit, or this brown one?"
185,Joey,"Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one."
186,Ross,Really?
187,Rachel,Oww!
188,Ross,Wow!
189,Ross,That aspirin dance really works!
190,Rachel,Oww!

199,Rachel,Whoa-whoa!
200,Ross,"Okay, okay."
201,Ross,"Look, you have got to go to a doctor!"
202,Ross,Okay?
203,Rachel,No.
204,Rachel,I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house.
205,Rachel,"It's a very big deal, there's a lot of people there I have to meet."
206,Ross,And I'm sure you're gonna make a big impression.
207,Ross,Hi!
208,Ross,I'm Rachel Green.
209,Ross,It's nice to meet you.
210,Ross,"Come on, you probably have a broken rib!"
211,Rachel,"Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it'll still be broken then."
212,Ross,Rach...
213,Rachel,"But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready."
214,Ross,Rachel...
215,Rachel,"Look, either help me or go."
216,Ross,Fine.

256,Ross,"No, y'know you don't, you don't wear enough of this."
257,Ross,What?

271,Phoebe,"Ooh, I have to tell you something."
272,Monica,What?
273,Phoebe,But I can't tell you.
274,Monica,"Okay, but wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me."
275,Phoebe,"Well, sure in a perfect world."
276,Phoebe,"But, no, I promised I wouldn't tell, and I swore to like all my gods."

300,Ross,"Rachel, I've seen you naked a million times."
301,Ross,I ate hot fudge off you naked.
302,Ross,"Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?"
303,Rachel,"Yeah, but that was different."
304,Rachel,Y'know?
305,Rachel,"I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it's weird."
306,Ross,"Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want."

398,Chandler,Hey!
399,Joey,Ohhh.
400,Joey,Ahh!
401,Joey,What are you doing?!
402,Joey,I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.
403,Chandler,I did!
404,Chandler,But the store wouldn't take her back!
405,Chandler,"So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?"
406,Chandler,"If they can't find a home for her, they kill her!"
407,Chandler,And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
408,Joey,"Okay, good, good, good, 혩cause, good, 혩cause I was kinda having second thoughts too."
409,Chandler,Okay.
410,Chandler,And it's not just chicks y'know?

412,Joey,That's horrible!
413,Joey,"Well, you did the right thing man."
414,Chandler,"Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way."

428,Monica,Pete.
429,Monica,"No, it's not bad."
430,Monica,It's not bad at all.
431,Monica,It's-it's really nice.
432,Monica,"You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you."
433,Monica,That's why I can't take this job.
434,Monica,"And well, we probably shouldn't see each other anymore."
435,Monica,I'm sorry.
436,Monica,"Okay, bye."
437,Monica,All right shut up for a second and let me just see something.
438,Monica,"Oh, wow!"
