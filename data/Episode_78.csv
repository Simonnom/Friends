93,Ross,Do you guys know who Carl is?
94,Chandler,"Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no."
95,Ross,"Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight."
96,Joey,Oh no!
97,Joey,How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!
98,Chandler,Forget about her.
99,Joey,"He's right, man."
100,Joey,Please.
101,Joey,Move on.
102,Joey,Go to China.
103,Joey,Eat Chinese food.
104,Chandler,"Course there, they just call it food."
105,Ross,Yeah...
106,Ross,I guess.
107,Ross,I don't혰I don't know.
108,Ross,"Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK?"
109,Joey,"Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you."
110,Ross,I know.
111,Joey,We want you to be happy.
112,Joey,"And I may only have a couple beers in me, but..."
113,Joey,"I love you, man."
114,Chandler,I'm still on my first.
115,Chandler,I just think you're nice.
116,Joey,"Like the three musketeers, only with fruit."
117,Chandler,Ooooh.
118,Monica,"OK, how does everybody like their burgers?"
119,Rachel,"Oh, no, no, no."
120,Rachel,Presents first.
121,Rachel,Food later.
122,Monica,"Hey, hold on there, tiger."
123,Monica,How's it going?
124,Monica,How you holding up?
125,Joey,"Well, not so good."
126,Joey,"She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I..."
127,Joey,Then you do.
128,Joey,"Heh, heh."
129,Monica,"So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?"
130,Joey,What do you mean?
131,Monica,"Y'know, just be there for her."
132,Joey,Not following you.
133,Monica,Think about it.
134,Rachel,"OK, I'm guessing this is from..."
135,Rachel,"Well, thank you, Melanie."
136,Chandler,"OK, this one right here is from me."
137,Rachel,"OK... ah, it's light... ...it rattles... it's...  Travel Scrabble!"
138,Rachel,"Oooohhh, thank you!"
139,Rachel,This one's from Joey... feels like a book.
140,Rachel,Thinks it's a book... feels like a book.
141,Rachel,And......it's a book!
142,Phoebe,"Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!"
143,Chandler,"Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die."
144,Rachel,Who's this from?
145,Chandler,"Oh, that's Ross's."
146,Rachel,Oh... ...  Oh my God.
147,Rachel,He remembered.
148,Phoebe,Remembered what?
149,Rachel,It was like months ago.
150,Rachel,"We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl."
151,Rachel,Oh!
152,Rachel,I can't believe he remembered!
153,Chandler,"Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?"
154,Phoebe,"Oh, it's so pretty."
155,Phoebe,This must have cost him a fortune.
156,Monica,I can't believe he did this.
157,Chandler,"Come on, Ross?"
158,Chandler,"Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?"
159,Rachel,What did you just say?
160,Chandler,ahem... um...
161,Chandler,Crystal duck.
162,Rachel,"No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?"
163,Chandler,F-hah.... flennin....
164,Rachel,Oh.... my God.
165,Chandler,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no...."
166,Joey,"That's good, just keep rubbing your head."
167,Joey,That'll turn back time.
168,Joey,Commercial Break
169,Rachel,"I mean, this is unbelievable."
170,Phoebe,I know.
171,Phoebe,"This is really, really huge."
172,Chandler,No it's not.
173,Chandler,It's small.
174,Chandler,It's tiny.
175,Chandler,It's petite.
176,Chandler,It's wee.
177,Phoebe,Nuh-uh.
178,Phoebe,I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
179,Chandler,"OK, is there a mute button on this woman?"
180,Monica,I think this is so great!
181,Monica,"I mean, you and Ross!"
182,Monica,D-did you have any idea?
183,Rachel,No!
184,Rachel,None!
185,Rachel,"I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just..."
186,Joey,"Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something."
187,Rachel,Ross?
188,Rachel,All this time?
189,Rachel,"Well, I've got to talk to him."
190,Chandler,H-He's in China!
191,Joey,The country.
192,Monica,"No, no, wait."
193,Monica,His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
194,Chandler,What about the time difference?
195,Monica,From here to the airport?
196,Chandler,Yes!
197,Chandler,You're never gonna make it!
198,Monica,"Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?"
199,Rachel,I-I-I don't know.
200,Chandler,Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
201,Joey,"He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait."
202,Monica,"Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now."
203,Rachel,I don't know.
204,Rachel,Maybe I'll know when I see him.
205,Phoebe,"Here, look, alright, does this help?"
206,Rachel,"Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him."
207,Rachel,"I mean, this is just too big."
208,Rachel,"Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him."
209,Rachel,I...
210,Rachel,"I gotta... OK, I'll see you later."
211,Chandler,"Rachel, I love you!"
212,Chandler,Deal with me first!
213,Ross,Flight
214,Ross,Ni-chou chi-ma!
215,Rachel,Ross!
216,Rachel,"Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me...."
217,Rachel,Flight
218,Rachel,Hi.
219,Rachel,Flight
220,Rachel,"Oh, no, no, I don't have one."
221,Rachel,I just need to talk to my friend.
222,Rachel,Flight
223,Rachel,"No, I know, but I혰he just went on."
224,Rachel,"He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just..."
225,Rachel,Flight
226,Rachel,"OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me?"
227,Rachel,Please?
228,Rachel,This is very important.
229,Rachel,Flight
230,Rachel,Uh...
231,Rachel,I don't know.
232,Rachel,Flight
233,Joey,"Heh, heh."
234,Joey,It was nothin'.
235,Joey,Uhhh.. y'know what?
236,Joey,Forget about me.
237,Joey,"Let's, uh... let's give you another turn."
238,Joey,Sure!
239,Joey,Why not?
240,Joey,How do you mean?
241,Monica,"Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?"
242,Rachel,I don't know.
243,Rachel,I don't know...
244,Rachel,"I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross."
245,Rachel,Y'know what I mean?
246,Rachel,"I mean, it's Ross."
247,Rachel,Monica and
248,Phoebe,Sure.
249,Rachel,"I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great."
250,Monica,"Oh my God, me too!"
251,Monica,Oh!
252,Monica,"Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law!"
253,Monica,Y'know what the best part is?
254,Monica,The best part is that you already know everything about him!
255,Monica,"I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!"
256,Phoebe,"Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date."
257,Monica,Another good point.
258,Phoebe,"No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place."
259,Phoebe,"Y'know, it's... you're committed."
260,Rachel,Huh?
261,Phoebe,"Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?"
262,Monica,Why isn't it working out?
263,Rachel,I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
264,Monica,Is he not cute enough for you?
265,Rachel,No!
266,Monica,Does he not make enough money?
267,Rachel,"No, I'm just...."
268,Phoebe,Maybe there's someone else.
269,Rachel,Wha...
270,Monica,Is there?
271,Monica,Is there someone else?
272,Rachel,No!
273,Rachel,There is.. there is noone else!
274,Monica,Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!
275,Chandler,"Hey, big..."
276,Joey,Shhhh!
277,Chandler,...spender.
278,Joey,She's still asleep.
279,Chandler,So how'd it go?
280,Joey,"Oh, it was amazing."
281,Joey,You know how you always think you're great in bed?
282,Chandler,The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
283,Joey,"Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great."
284,Joey,So I had to do all this other stuff.
285,Joey,"And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!"
286,Chandler,"Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route."
287,Joey,It was amazing!
288,Joey,And not just for her... uh-uh.
289,Joey,"For me, too."
290,Joey,"It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind."
291,Joey,"But all my other senses are heightened, y'know?"
292,Joey,It's like...
293,Joey,I was able to appreciate it on another level.
294,Chandler,I didn't know you had another level.
295,Joey,I know!
296,Joey,Neither did I!
297,Monica,"Hey, great skirt!"
298,Monica,Birthday present?
299,Rachel,Yeah.
300,Monica,"Oh, from who?"
301,Rachel,From you.
302,Rachel,I exchanged the blouse you got me.
303,Monica,"Well, it's the thought."
304,Monica,"Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours?"
305,Monica,At gate 27-B?
306,Rachel,"Uh, yeah."
307,Rachel,"Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided this혰this whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea."
308,Monica,"Oh, why?"
309,Rachel,"Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him."
310,Rachel,I would be going out with all of you.
311,Rachel,"Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna..."
312,Monica,"No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!"
313,Rachel,"Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so..."
314,Monica,I am not 'so'!
315,Monica,"OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but..."
316,Monica,I'll be good.
317,Monica,I promise.
318,Rachel,Who is it?
319,Rachel,C'mon up.
320,Monica,Behind my brother's back?
321,Monica,... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
322,Joey,Seven hundred bucks!
323,Chandler,"Alright, you did it!"
324,Chandler,Do we have any fruit?
325,Joey,"Man, hell of a two weeks, huh?"
326,Joey,"Y'know what, though?"
327,Joey,I really feel like I learned something.
328,Chandler,Really?
329,Chandler,"So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?"
330,Joey,"What, are you crazy?"
331,Joey,"When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?"
332,Ross,I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
333,Rachel,"Would you excuse me, please?"
334,Rachel,I'm trying to have a date here.
335,Ross,"Fine, just stop thinking about me."
336,Ross,"Can't do it, can you?"
337,Rachel,So I'm thinking about you.
338,Rachel,So what?
339,Ross,I don't get it.
340,Ross,"What do you see in this guy, anyway?"
341,Rachel,Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
342,Ross,"Rachel, come on."
343,Ross,Give us a chance.
344,Rachel,"Ross, it's too hard."
345,Ross,"No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else?"
346,Ross,Who cares about them.
347,Ross,This is about us.
348,Ross,"Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade."
349,Rachel,"Ross, you're like my best friend."
350,Ross,I know.
351,Rachel,"If we broke up, and I lost you..."
352,Ross,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
353,Ross,What makes you think we're gonna break up?
354,Rachel,"Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?"
355,Ross,No.
356,Ross,But... it only has to happen once.
357,Ross,"Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right?"
358,Ross,"I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?"
359,Rachel,I don't know...
360,Rachel,"I mean, I've never looked at you that way before."
361,Ross,"Well, start looking."
362,Rachel,Wow.
363,Rachel,Right!
364,Rachel,You're right!
365,Rachel,You know what?
366,Rachel,I forgot...
367,Rachel,I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport.
368,Rachel,I am so sorry!
369,Rachel,"I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do...."
370,Rachel,I mean혰I'm sorry.
371,Rachel,I-I-I gotta go.
372,Rachel,I'm sorry.
373,Rachel,"Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry."
374,Rachel,Hi.
375,Ross,"Oh, hey, hey, I got that."
376,Ross,No problem.
377,Ross,I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
378,Ross,Yeah.
379,Ross,"No, no, they will."
380,Ross,I just... uh... Ross and
381,Ross,"Come on, they're gonna love you."
382,Ross,End
