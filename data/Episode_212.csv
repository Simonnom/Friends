184,Rachel,"Well, I didn't see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face."
185,Monica,What?
186,Phoebe,Why?
187,Rachel,"The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep."
188,Phoebe,Ohh!
189,Phoebe,"So, did you get to meet her?"
190,Rachel,"No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, ""I'm Rachel Greep!"
191,Rachel,"I'm Rachel Greep!"""
192,Rachel,and he let her right in.
193,Monica,So you hit her in the face?
194,Rachel,"No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her."
195,Rachel,Ohhh!
196,Rachel,"I can't believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me."
197,Phoebe,"Aww, Pheebs."
198,Rachel,"Honey, that's you're name."
199,Phoebe,That's short for Phoebe?!
200,Phoebe,I thought that was just what we called each other!
201,Monica,Hey!
202,Monica,You're wearing pants!
203,Chandler,That's right!
204,Chandler,Where are the guys?

228,Chandler,Ow!
229,Rachel,Howhow did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?
230,Chandler,"Maybe, she doesn't hit him all the time."
231,Ross,"When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet!"
232,Ross,Who wouldn't be miserable?
233,Ross,"I'm telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person."
234,Ross,"I've gotta go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!"
235,Monica,"He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard."
236,Rachel,I don't get this!
237,Rachel,She was horrible!
238,Chandler,"Okay, I'm going to go stand over there."
239,Monica,Why do you care so much anyway?
240,Rachel,I don't care!
241,Rachel,"All right, y'know what I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua thaty'know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!"
242,Monica,"Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail."
243,Rachel,"Oh, y'know, would you just for once, not remember everylittlething!"
244,Chandler,"So y'know, uh, when's he getting back?"
245,Monica,A couple of days.
246,Chandler,"Y'know, I knew something like this was going to happen."
247,Monica,What are you doing?!
248,Monica,Chandler!
249,Monica,You can't just go back a phase!
250,Chandler,Yes you can.
251,Chandler,"You're thinking about time, you can't go back in time."
252,Phoebe,"Well, look, why don't you just, why don't you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us."
253,Monica,"Yeah, come on, we can be guys!"
254,Chandler,No you can't.
255,Phoebe,Come on!
256,Phoebe,Let us be guys!
257,Phoebe,Maybe we want to be guys!
258,Chandler,"You don't want to be guys, you'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long."
259,Phoebe,"Y'know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!"
260,Chandler,Okay.
261,Phoebe,I'm sorry.
262,Joey,Hey!

275,Joey,"No-no, it's uh, it's Heston."
276,Joey,The A.D
277,Joey,"Yeah, the man wreaks!"
278,Joey,Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.
279,Joey,The A.D
280,Joey,"Really, a shower huh?"
281,Joey,"And uh, which-which room might that be?"

291,Phoebe,Very exotic.
292,Rachel,"Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn't call."
293,Rachel,I mean you'd think he'd be worried about me not showing up at his club.
294,Rachel,"Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!"
295,Phoebe,Come on!
296,Phoebe,Look where you are!

334,Rachel,I can't believe it!
335,Rachel,He still hasn't called.
336,Phoebe,"Who, Josh?"
337,Rachel,It's Joshua.
338,Monica,"What, he doesn't like Josh?"

341,Phoebe,Oh no!
342,Phoebe,Wait!
343,Phoebe,Wait!
344,Phoebe,"Okay, y'know what, you were right, you were right."
345,Phoebe,"We really weren't great at being guys, but you know why?"
346,Phoebe,Because we're girls.
347,Chandler,Yeah?
348,Phoebe,And do you know what girls are really good at?
349,Chandler,Stripping!
350,Phoebe,"No, listening!"
351,Phoebe,Sit!

358,Monica,Come on!
359,Monica,Chandler!
360,Chandler,"Look, forget it."
361,Chandler,"We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay?"
362,Chandler,"Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn't picture myself with any of them."
363,Monica,"They really were pretty, weren't they?"
364,Phoebe,"Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one."
365,Monica,"Oh, Candy!"
366,Monica,She was so spunky!
367,Phoebe,Yeah.
368,Monica,"Y'know, I think if I were going to be with a woman."
369,Monica,"It'd, it'd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite."
370,Rachel,"See, I don't know, for me it would have to Chantal."
