135,Rachel,"Here are your keys, hon."
136,Monica,Okay.
137,Rachel,"Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?"
138,Monica,You know what probably happened?
139,Monica,Someone musta stolen my credit card.
140,Rachel,And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
141,Monica,That is an excellent excellent question.
142,Monica,That is excellent.
143,Rachel,"Monica, what is with you?"
144,Rachel,Who'd you have lunch with?
145,Monica,Judy.
146,Rachel,Who?

150,Rachel,You were with Julie?
151,Monica,"Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend."
152,Monica,"And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping."
153,Rachel,Oh.
154,Rachel,Oh my God.
155,Monica,"Honey, wait."
156,Monica,We only did it once.
157,Monica,It didn't mean anything to me.
158,Rachel,"Yeah, right."
159,Rachel,Sure!
160,Monica,"Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time."
161,Monica,"Look, I'm sorry, all right."
162,Monica,I never meant for you to find out!
163,Rachel,"Oh, please, you wanted to get caught."
164,Monica,That is not true!
165,Rachel,"Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?"
166,Monica,Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
167,Rachel,"Ok, Monica."
168,Rachel,I just have to know one thing.
169,Rachel,Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's?
170,Rachel,Oh!
171,Rachel,"Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now."
172,Rachel,Commercial Break
173,Monica,"Hi, who's this?"
174,Monica,"Hi, Joanne."
175,Monica,Is Rachel working?
176,Monica,It's Monica.
177,Monica,"Yes, I know I did a horrible thing."
178,Monica,"Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok?"
179,Monica,"No, I don't care what Steve thinks."
180,Monica,"Hi, Steve."
181,Monica,Carol and
182,Phoebe,"Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out."
183,Ross,I did not freak out.
184,Ross,Because it's breast milk.
185,Ross,It's gross.
186,Ross,"No, no, Carol."
187,Ross,There's nothing wrong with it.
188,Ross,"I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults."
189,Chandler,Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
190,Ross,That would be no.
191,Phoebe,Come on.
192,Phoebe,It doesn't taste bad.
193,Joey,"Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh..."
194,Joey,Exactly.
195,Ross,You've tasted it?
196,Ross,You've tasted it.
197,Ross,"Oh, you've tasted it."
198,Ross,Gimme the bottle.
199,Ross,Gimme the towel.
200,Chandler,Howdy.
201,Joey,Gimme a box a juice.
202,Joey,"Well, they switched me over to Hombre."
203,Chandler,"Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed."
204,Joey,Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it.
205,Joey,"You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day."
206,Chandler,What do you care?
207,Chandler,You're an actor.
208,Chandler,This is your day job.
209,Chandler,This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
210,Joey,"I know, but, I was the best, you know?"
211,Joey,I liked being the best.
212,Joey,I don't know.
213,Joey,Maybe I should just get outta the game.
214,Joey,They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
215,Chandler,"All right, say you do that."
216,Chandler,You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar.
217,Chandler,And then where're you gonna run?
218,Joey,Yeah I guess you're right.
219,Chandler,You're damn right I'm right.
220,Chandler,I say you show this guy what you're made of.
221,Chandler,I say you stand your ground.
222,Chandler,I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
223,Joey,I'm gonna do it.
224,Chandler,All right.
225,Chandler,Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
226,Monica,I don't know what else to say.
227,Rachel,"Well that works out good, because I'm not listening."
228,Monica,"I feel terrible, I really do."
229,Rachel,"Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?"
230,Monica,"Rachel,  say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together."
231,Monica,Is that so terrible?
232,Rachel,Yes.
233,Monica,It's that terrible?
234,Rachel,Yes.
235,Rachel,"Monica, you don't get it."
236,Rachel,"It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you."
237,Monica,Me?
238,Monica,What are you talking about?
239,Monica,Nobody could steal me from you.
240,Monica,"I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you."
241,Monica,"I mean,  you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you."
242,Rachel,I love you too.
243,Phoebe,"You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too."
244,Phoebe,"Oh, I really needed that."
245,Monica,"Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong."
246,Monica,"I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out."
247,Monica,"I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her."
248,Monica,"Would you just give that a chance, for me?"
249,Rachel,"I'd do anything for you, you know that."
250,Monica,I'd do anything for you.
251,Phoebe,"Wait, wait, wait, wait!"
252,Joey,Mornin'.
253,Joey,"I said, mornin'."
254,Joey,Hombre
255,Joey,"Yeah, I'm ready."
256,Joey,"These new kids, they never last."
257,Joey,"Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'."
258,Joey,"Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?"
259,Rachel,So.
260,Rachel,I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit.
261,Rachel,"I mean, you know, we've never really talked."
262,Rachel,"I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?"
263,Rachel,Really?
264,Rachel,Me?
265,Rachel,"Well, you're not totally paranoid."
266,Rachel,"Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right."
267,Rachel,"Yeah, that'd be great."
268,Rachel,I'd love it.
269,Rachel,"All right, Julie."
270,Rachel,Bye.
271,Rachel,What a manipulative bitch.
272,Rachel,Closing Credits
273,Ross,That's not bad.
274,Ross,End
