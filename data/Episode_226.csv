14,Joey,"I did do it, I'm a professional."
15,Monica,Then what's the problem?
16,Joey,"See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'."

123,Phoebe,It could be like a big giant guy.
124,Joey,"Man, I got this close to him  and Monica kneed me in the back."
125,Joey,What's going on?
126,Phoebe,We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.
127,Joey,"Oh, well."
128,Joey,Just ask her how long she's gonna live.

140,Monica,"Oh, absolutely."
141,Monica,"Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about."

156,Ross,"What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'"
157,Rachel,Oh my God this is sooo humiliating.
158,Rachel,"I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school."
159,Rachel,I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out.
160,Rachel,"Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes."

188,Chandler,"Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband."
189,Phoebe,"What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy."
190,Phoebe,"I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip."
191,Chandler,"Okay, I'll do it!"
192,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah!"

200,Monica,"Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will."
201,Monica,"You know what, maybe I don't need to have children."
202,Monica,"You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I..."
203,Monica,"I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do."
204,Monica,BEST
205,Rachel,What.
206,Rachel,BEST
207,Ross,"Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that..."
208,Rachel,"Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?"
209,Ross,"Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend."
210,Rachel,Oh dear God.
211,Ross,"Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight."
212,Ross,"And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis."
213,Ross,What are you doing I'm serious.
214,Ross,"Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me  Cheers."
215,Rachel,She you in the parking lot.
216,Ross,"No, Rach!"
217,Rachel,"Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave."
218,Rachel,"I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings ."
219,Rachel,"See now, tonight, all I  really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity."
220,Rachel,"Well , I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen."
221,Rachel,"There's nothing really left to say except.... ""Her name was Lola."
222,Rachel,She was a showgirl.
223,Rachel,"With yellow feathers , feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there."
224,Rachel,"She would..."""
225,Ross,"Marenge,"
226,Rachel,"""...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha."
227,Rachel,"And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar."
228,Rachel,"At the, wait, wait, everybody.."""
229,Ross,Everybody!
230,Rachel,"At the Copa, Copa Cabana  The hottest spot north of Havana."
231,Rachel,"At the Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa...."
232,Monica,You'll do what?
233,Monica,Oh my God!
234,Monica,Really?
235,Monica,You're the most wonderful man.
236,Monica,"And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'"
237,Monica,"Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say."
238,Monica,"I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one."
239,Monica,I know you do.
240,Monica,Me too.
241,Monica,So what now?
242,Chandler,"Where is she, Where is she?"
243,Chandler,"Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?"
244,Rachel,"Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here."

247,Phoebe,"Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door."
248,Phoebe,"It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil."
249,Phoebe,I think what you have to do is try not to...
250,Chandler,Oh my God!
251,Ross,"All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend."
252,Ross,"So just, just shut up and close your eyes ."
253,Joey,"Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it."
254,Joey,But that was a hell of a kiss.
255,Joey,Rachel is a very lucky girl.
256,Joey,END
