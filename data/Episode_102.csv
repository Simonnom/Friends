4,Phoebe,Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth.
5,Ross,15?
6,Ross,Your personal best!
7,Phoebe,Where were you?
8,Ross,"Oh, on a date."
9,Ross,"Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate."
10,Chandler,"Oh, yeah!"
11,Chandler,How did you meet her?
12,Phoebe,"Oh, which museum?"
13,Phoebe,"No, answer his."
14,Ross,"Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars."
15,Ross,She was totally at my mercy.
16,Chandler,Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
17,Ross,"No, I'm getting back down cause she lives in Poughkeepsie."
18,Ross,"She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away."
19,Chandler,How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie?
20,Chandler,That joke would've killed in Albany.
21,Joey,Done!
22,Joey,I did it!
23,Joey,"Heh, who's stupid now?"
24,Joey,Opening Credits
25,Chandler,"Hey, look at this!"
26,Chandler,They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
27,Phoebe,"Umm, that paper's two weeks old."
28,Chandler,"All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?!"
29,Chandler,"I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can't believe I missed it."
30,Rachel,"Hey, y'know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with!"
31,Rachel,I hate being alone this time of year!
32,Rachel,"Next thing you know it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then bang!before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again."
33,Rachel,"Ohh, I want somebody!"
34,Rachel,"Y'know, I want a man!!"
35,Rachel,"I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship, y'know, just like a fling would be great."
36,Chandler,Really?!
37,Chandler,I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
38,Rachel,"Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung."
39,Joey,"Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas."
40,Chandler,Y'know what?
41,Chandler,"There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?"
42,Rachel,Yeah!
43,Rachel,"Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single."
44,Rachel,How come you never offered this before?
45,Chandler,"Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy."
46,Chandler,"So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy."
47,Rachel,Okay!
48,Rachel,No accountants.
49,Rachel,"Oh, and no one from like legal."
50,Rachel,I don't like guys with boring jobs.
51,Chandler,Oh and Ross was like what?
52,Chandler,A lion tamer?
53,Phoebe,What's wrong Mon?
54,Monica,"Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me."
55,Phoebe,Oh.
56,Monica,"I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this  on my chef's hat."
57,Phoebe,"Hey, maybe they meant to write, Quiet, bitch.'"
58,Rachel,"Hey, honey!"
59,Rachel,What's the matter?
60,Rachel,"Fine, I was just trying to be nice!"
61,Rachel,Whoa!
62,Monica,I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
63,Joey,Ohhh!
64,Monica,"I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would."
65,Monica,But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
66,Rachel,"Well, wait a minute, you're the boss!"
67,Rachel,Why don't you just yell at them?
68,Rachel,"Or, fire them?"
69,Monica,"I would love too, but I can't!"
70,Monica,"I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation."
71,Chandler,"Hey, you know what you can do?"
72,Chandler,"I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody."
73,Chandler,"Then they would all know, who's boss."
74,Joey,"Hey, Mon!"
75,Joey,"I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?"
76,Monica,That's a good idea!
77,Monica,"Wait, do you know how to waiter?"
78,Joey,Good enough to get fired.
79,Monica,"All right, you're hired!"
80,Joey,Hey!
81,Joey,That must be why I got fired last week!
82,Joey,Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
83,Chandler,Yes.
84,Chandler,"I say, Drew!"
85,Chandler,Are you seeing anybody right now?
86,Chandler,"Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm I mean No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out."
87,Chandler,I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!
88,Chandler,"See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up."
89,Chandler,"Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel."
90,Chandler,"Oh, by the way, that is her full name."
91,Chandler,"Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!"
92,Chandler,"Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!"
93,Phoebe,Hey!
94,Phoebe,"You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone."
95,Phoebe,Do you want to hear it?
96,Phoebe,"Monica, Rachel, and"
97,Joey,Yes!
98,Phoebe,"Happy Chanukah, Monica!"
99,Phoebe,"May your Christmas be snowy, Joey!"

101,Phoebe,"Spin the draddle, Rachel!"
102,Rachel,"Pheebs, that's great!"
103,Phoebe,"Oh, yay!"
104,Rachel,"But y'know umm, Rachel doesn't rhyme with draddle."
105,Phoebe,I know but it's so hard!
106,Phoebe,Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
107,Joey,What are you talking about?
108,Joey,Lots of things rhyme with Rachel.

116,Phoebe,Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
117,Monica,Didn't your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
118,Rachel,Oh yeah!
119,Phoebe,Pumpkin?
120,Phoebe,Yeah.
121,Phoebe,"But did he ever call you like, Budolph?"
122,Chandler,"Hello, children!"
123,Chandler,Have I got the 50 guys for you!
124,Rachel,Really?
125,Chandler,"Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me!"

134,Chandler,"Y'know what, I'm gonna uh, play the field just a little more."
135,Rachel,Chandler!
136,Chandler,Guys are signing over their 401-K's to me?
137,Phoebe,You work with robots!
138,Chandler,Yes.
139,Chandler,"Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer."
140,Rachel,"Ohh, I like swimmer's bodies!"
141,Chandler,"Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards."
142,Rachel,"Op, I like credit cards!"
143,Chandler,"See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?"
144,Rachel,"Well, so what does he do?"
145,Chandler,"Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division."
146,Rachel,Your company has a fine foods division?
147,Chandler,"It's a big company, I don'tif youI"
148,Joey,"Now, wait a second!"
149,Joey,You make food and robots?
150,Phoebe,No!
151,Phoebe,"No, the robots just work for them."
152,Monica,"All right, I'm gonna go to work."
153,Monica,Does anybody have a problem with that?
154,Joey,"Yeah, lady, I do!"
155,Joey,I got a problem with that!
156,Monica,You want a problem?
157,Monica,I'll give you a problem!
158,Joey,"Oh, what are you gonna do?"
159,Joey,You're gonna fire me?
160,Monica,"You bet your ass, I'm gonna fire you!"
161,Monica,Thank you.

163,Ross,I should get going.
164,Ross,I-I got a date tonight.
165,Chandler,Oh yeah!
166,Chandler,With who?
167,Ross,You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
168,Chandler,Yeah.
169,Ross,Not her.
170,Ross,"Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can't decide between the two of them."
171,Ross,"Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun."
172,Ross,"But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown."
173,Ross,"Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun."
174,Phoebe,"If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?"
175,Ross,"Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y'know?"
176,Ross,She lives so close.
177,Ross,"And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that wasif she was kidding was very funny."
178,Ross,"On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist."
179,Joey,Hey!
180,Ross,Hey!
181,Chandler,"Hey, man!"
182,Phoebe,Hey!
183,Phoebe,"Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?"

188,Monica,They baked it.
189,Monica,I can't take this anymore.
190,Monica,"I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight."
191,Joey,You got it!
192,Joey,Oh-oh!
193,Monica,What are you doing?
194,Joey,It's still a tiny bit on fire there.
195,Monica,Thanks.
196,Monica,I think you got it!
197,Rachel,Chandler!!
198,Rachel,You have the best taste in men!
199,Chandler,"Well, like father, like son."
200,Rachel,Patrick and I had such a great time last night!
201,Rachel,I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
202,Chandler,Really?!
203,Chandler,I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious?
204,Chandler,I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
205,Rachel,"Well, y'know, possibly."
206,Rachel,"You didn't tell him that, though?"
207,Rachel,Right?
208,Chandler,"Ummmmmmmm, no."
209,Rachel,You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?!
210,Rachel,You don't tell the guy that!
211,Chandler,Why not?!
212,Chandler,I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to getoh I see.
213,Rachel,"Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first dateoh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea."
214,Monica,"Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?"
215,Joey,Yeah.
216,Joey,"Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey."
217,Joey,"Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname."
218,Joey,There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!
219,Joey,The
220,Monica,Okay.
221,Monica,Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials?
222,Monica,"Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bagWhy is nobody writing these down?"
223,Monica,The
224,Monica,Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
225,Monica,The
226,Monica,"Okay, forget the specials for a minute."
227,Monica,"Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm,  tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere The"
228,Monica,A positive atmosphere!
229,Monica,But I-I-I have had it up to here.
230,Monica,"From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway!"
231,Monica,All right?
232,Monica,Does anybody have a problem with that?!!
233,Monica,Hey new guy!
234,Monica,"I said, does anybody have a problem with that?"
235,Joey,No ma'am.
236,Joey,The
237,Monica,What the hell happened?
238,Joey,I am so-so-so sorry.
239,Joey,I was gonna do it!
240,Joey,Really!
241,Joey,"But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, ""Wow!"
242,Joey,"It's been a long time since I had  327 + 238 dollars!"""
243,Monica,"Joey, we had a deal."
244,Monica,That-that's why you're here!
245,Monica,I've got to fire you!
246,Joey,And I gotta pay rent!
247,Joey,"Look, how-how about this?"
248,Joey,"You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you."
249,Monica,What kinda things have you been saying?
250,Joey,"Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in."
251,Phoebe,"Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica."
252,Phoebe,Very merry
253,Chandler,"Oh, y'know, y'know what Pheebs?"
254,Phoebe,What?
255,Chandler,"I'm not Jewish, so"
256,Phoebe,So!
257,Phoebe,"Ross doesn't really decorate his tree with floss, but you don't hear him complaining do you?"
258,Phoebe,God!
259,Chandler,Bad dream?
260,Ross,I wasn't sleeping.
261,Chandler,"Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe's song about?"
262,Ross,The one with the cat.
263,Ross,"I gotta go, I've got another date."
264,Phoebe,"So, did you pick one yet?"
265,Ross,"No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke."
266,Ross,But it was a different joke than I thoughtit wasn't that funny.
267,Ross,So I'm still torn.
268,Phoebe,"Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both."
269,Phoebe,Okay?
270,Phoebe,"You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown."
271,Phoebe,"And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done!"
272,Ross,"Y'know, you're right."
273,Ross,Thank you.
274,Phoebe,"Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague."
275,Chandler,Prague?
276,Phoebe,There's sooo much you don't know.
277,Rachel,Chandler!
278,Rachel,"Patrick just uh, ended things with me."
279,Rachel,Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
280,Chandler,I did!
281,Chandler,I absolutely did!
282,Rachel,You idiot!
283,Chandler,"I'm sure you're right, but why?"
284,Rachel,You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship!
285,Rachel,You don't tell the guy that!
286,Rachel,Now you scared him away!
287,Chandler,"Oh, man."
288,Chandler,"I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry."
289,Rachel,"Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!"
290,Chandler,I know!
291,Chandler,I know!
292,Rachel,Oh!
293,Rachel,See just I'm right back where I started!
294,Rachel,"Aww, this sucks!"
295,Rachel,"Being alone, sucks!"
296,Chandler,"Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody!"
297,Chandler,You're a great catch!
298,Chandler,"Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once."
299,Rachel,Really?
300,Chandler,Yeah!
301,Chandler,"You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?"
302,Rachel,No.
303,Chandler,"Oh, it doesn't matter."
304,Chandler,"Hey, y'know what, I've got two tickets to tonight's Rangers game, you wanna come with me?"
305,Rachel,Cute guys in little shorts?
306,Rachel,Sure.
307,Chandler,"Well, actually it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth."
308,Rachel,Well that sounds fun too.
309,Chandler,Have you ever been with a woman?
310,Rachel,What?!
311,Rachel,"Chandler, what is the matter with you?"
312,Chandler,So there is no good time to ask that question.
