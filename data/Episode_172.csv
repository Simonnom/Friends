94,Monica,"Yeah, what, do you think we're stupid?"
95,Joey,You're not stupid.
96,Joey,You're meaner than I thought.
97,Monica,What do you say?
98,Chandler,Forget it!
99,Chandler,"Okay, I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!"
100,Rachel,You're bachelor pad?
101,Monica,Have you even had a girl up here?

104,Joey,"Yeah, you do!"
105,Joey,Come on!
106,Chandler,"Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?"
107,Joey,"Come on, season tickets!"
108,Joey,"Season tickets, do you know what that means?"
109,Chandler,Forget it!
110,Chandler,"Okay, I'm not giving up the apartment."
111,Joey,"Oh comelook, when I was a kid my dad's company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right?"
112,Joey,My dad never won!
113,Joey,"Of course, he wasn't in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!"
114,Ross,"Hey, guys!"
115,Joey,Hey!
116,Chandler,Oh my God!
117,Joey,We don't make enough fun of you already?
118,Ross,"Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it."
119,Chandler,You do know that Wham broke up?
120,Ross,"I like it, and Emily likes it, and that's what counts."
121,Ross,"So uh, how are you guys doing?"
122,Joey,"Oh-no, don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear."
123,Chandler,Where is Emily?
124,Ross,"Ugh, she's saying good-bye to her uncle."
125,Chandler,"Man, didn't she like just get here?"
126,Ross,Yeah!!
127,Ross,Yeah!
128,Chandler,Easy tiger.
129,Ross,"I just, I hate this so much!"
130,Ross,"I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it's-it's so great."
131,Ross,"But at the same time I'm thinking, ""Well, I'm gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."""
132,Chandler,So what are you going to do?
133,Ross,Nothing!
134,Ross,There's nothing to do!
135,Ross,"I mean, she lives there, I live here."
136,Ross,"I mean, she-she'd have to uh, move here."
137,Ross,She should move here!
138,Joey,What?
139,Ross,I could ask her to live with me!
140,Chandler,Are you serious?
141,Ross,"I mean, why not!"
142,Ross,"I mean, I mean why not?"
143,Chandler,Because you've only known her for six weeks!
144,Chandler,"Okay, I've got a carton of milk in my fridge I've had a longer relationship with!"
145,Ross,"Look guys, when I'm with her it's-it's-it's like she brings this-this-this great side out of me."
146,Ross,"I mean I-I-I love her, y'know?"
147,Chandler,And I love the milk!
148,Chandler,"But, I'm not gonna some British girl to move in with me!"
149,Chandler,"Joey, you say things now."
150,Joey,"All right look, Ross, he's right."
151,Joey,"Emily's great, she's great!"
152,Joey,"But this way too soon, you're only gonna scare her!"
153,Ross,I don't want to do that.
154,Joey,No!
155,Joey,"You don't want to wreck it, you don't want to go to fast!"
156,Ross,"Yeah, no, you're right, I know, you're right, I'm not, I'm not gonna do it."
157,Ross,"All right, thanks guys."
158,Chandler,"Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go."
159,Phoebe,That's too hard.
160,Phoebe,Too hard!
161,Monica,"All right boys, last chance for the tickets!"
162,Rachel,"Or I'll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua."
163,Chandler,No thank you.
164,Joey,Wait-wait-wait-wait!
165,Joey,Come on!
166,Joey,"Come on, let's trade!"
167,Joey,"The timing's perfect, I just clogged the toilet!"
168,Chandler,"Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do!"
169,Chandler,"Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here!"
170,Chandler,Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
171,Joey,Yes!
172,Joey,Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?!
173,Joey,No!
174,Joey,I didn't read yours!
175,Joey,"But come on, we can go to the game tonight!"
176,Chandler,"Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats."
177,Joey,It's the Knicks!
178,Chandler,Screw the Knicks!
179,Joey,Whoa!
180,Chandler,I didn't mean that.
181,Chandler,I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
182,Joey,Huh.
183,Chandler,And the Knicks rule all.
184,Joey,"Yeah, the Knicks rule all!"
185,Phoebe,"Hey, so?"
186,Phoebe,Are you gonna do it?
187,Chandler,No.
188,Chandler,No.
189,Chandler,"We're not gonna do that, y'know why?"
190,Chandler,Because its not an even trade.
191,Rachel,"All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?"
192,Joey,Done!
193,Rachel,Let me finish.
194,Joey,Oh.
195,Rachel,"I'm talking about a bet, winner takes all."
196,Joey,"Ooh, we could end up with nothing."
197,Phoebe,Or you could end up with everything.
198,Joey,"Ooh, I like that."
199,Monica,"All right, so what do you say?"
200,Chandler,No!
201,Monica,"Oh, just do it!"
202,Chandler,"Op, op, I'm convinced!"
203,Joey,"Come on man, you know I'd do it for you!"
204,Joey,"Because, you're my best friend."
205,Chandler,"All right, but you can't use that again for a whole year."
206,Chandler,I'm in.
207,Joey,All right!
208,Phoebe,"Ooh, this is so exciting!"
209,Phoebe,"Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?"
210,Rachel,"Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she's the only who's impartial, and she's so pretty."
211,Phoebe,Okay.
212,Phoebe,"Umm, ooh, oohoh, I have a game!"
213,Joey,Okay!
214,Chandler,Okay!
215,Phoebe,This is great!

218,Phoebe,"Oh, well, it doesn't have a nameoh, okay, Phoebeball!"
219,Phoebe,"No, it doesn't have a name."
220,Phoebe,"Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?"
221,Monica,They're green?
222,Phoebe,Good!
223,Phoebe,Good!
224,Phoebe,Five points!
225,Phoebe,"All right, Joey, same question."
226,Joey,"Uhh, they're tall."
227,Phoebe,"Ooh, three points."
228,Phoebe,"Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy."
229,Monica,That's not even a game!
230,Rachel,What?
231,Rachel,Shut up!
232,Rachel,We're winning!
233,Monica,You wanna finish this right now?
234,Monica,"All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins."
235,Monica,What do you say?
236,Chandler,"Fine, let's do it."
237,Phoebe,"Oh, I have cards!"
238,Joey,Oh.
239,Monica,"Oh, good."
240,Phoebe,Yeah!

291,Ross,Hey!
292,Ross,Move in with me.
293,Ross,"Don't be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it's too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be."
294,Ross,I know.
295,Ross,"Well, so, you-you'll get a job here!"
296,Ross,"I mean, I'm always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!"
297,Ross,"No, I can't."
298,Ross,"I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can't leave him."
299,Ross,Isn'tyou don't think there's any way?
300,Ross,What?
301,Ross,"No, no, don't."
302,Ross,Why don't we?

309,Ross,"Yeah, I know, so what?"
310,Ross,"I mean, who's-who's to say?"
311,Ross,Does that me we-we can't do it?
312,Ross,"Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian."
313,Ross,"I mean, this, this makes sense for us."
314,Ross,Come on!
315,Ross,"I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont!"
316,Ross,"I mean, last night I got my ear pierced!"
317,Ross,Me!

325,Ross,"Come here, come here."
326,Ross,"Uh,  ow!"

328,Ross,Damn!
329,Ross,I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
330,Chandler,Those were like the best seats ever.
331,Joey,Oh yeah.
332,Joey,Hey!
333,Joey,Should we give these shirts to the girls?
334,Joey,"Y'know, kinda like a peace offering."
335,Chandler,"Oh yeah, that's very nice."
336,Chandler,"Plus, y'know they were free and they're too small."
337,Chandler,Oh.
338,Chandler,"Oh, God!"
339,Joey,"Hey, want a beer?"
340,Joey,WHOA!!!
341,Chandler,I KNOW!!
342,Chandler,Open up!
343,Chandler,Open up!
344,Chandler,Open up!
345,Monica,"We'll discuss it, in the morning!"
346,Chandler,What the hell is going on?
347,Rachel,We took our apartment back!
348,Phoebe,I had nothing to do with it.
349,Phoebe,"Okay, it was my idea, but I don't feel good about it."
350,Chandler,"We are switching back, right now!"
351,Monica,"No, we're not!"
352,Monica,We're not leaving!
353,Chandler,"Well, you're gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we're switching it back!"
354,Chandler,There's nothing you can do to stop us!
355,Chandler,"Right, Joe?"
356,Joey,I don't know.
357,Chandler,What?
358,Joey,I don't want to move again!
359,Chandler,"I don't care, this is our apartment!"
360,Chandler,"And they stoleyou stole itour apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice!"
361,Chandler,And I am getting it back right now.
362,Chandler,I'm getting back right now!
363,Rachel,All right.
364,Rachel,"We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer."
365,Chandler,"Oh no-no-no, no more offers."
366,Chandler,You can't offer anything to us!
367,Rachel,Let us keep the apartment and
368,Monica,"As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute."
369,Chandler,Totally worth it!
370,Joey,That was one good minute!
371,Chandler,Good night.
372,Joey,Good night.
373,Monica,Men are such idiots.
374,Rachel,Yeah!
375,Rachel,Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
376,Phoebe,"That's so funny to think if you'd just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all."
377,Monica,"Yeah, let-let-let's pretend that's not true."
378,Rachel,Yeah.
379,Phoebe,"Okay, scarf's done."

388,Ross,"Uhh, okay, it's uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married."
389,Phoebe,What?
390,Phoebe,"Oh, are you pregnant too?"
391,Monica,"When, when didhow, how did you"
392,Ross,"We, we just decided to uh, to go for it."
393,Ross,"Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys"
394,Rachel,"Yeah, I-I heard."
395,Rachel,I think it's great!
396,Rachel,"Ohh, I'm so happy for you!"
397,Chandler,"Oh, well, that's great!"
398,Joey,Yeah!
399,Joey,Yeah!
400,Monica,I can't believe you're getting married!
