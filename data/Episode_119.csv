97,Monica,"Kathy, I love you!"
98,Monica,Oh!
99,Phoebe,"So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me."
100,Monica,"Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?"
101,Phoebe,Uh-huh.
102,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that ""Woo-hoo"" thing."
103,Ross,Hey!
104,Monica,Hey!
105,Phoebe,Hey.
106,Ross,So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!
107,Monica,Rachel's not here.
108,Ross,Oh.
109,Monica,How's it going with her?
110,Ross,"Great, actually."
111,Ross,"I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night."
112,Ross,"Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little ""playing"" ourselves."
113,Rachel,Hi guys!
114,Rachel,This is Josh.
115,Rachel,"Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross."
116,Monica,"Hi, Josh."
117,Phoebe,Hi.

123,Rachel,Okay.
124,Rachel,I'll miss you.
125,Phoebe,"Wow, cute one!"
126,Monica,Very!
127,Rachel,"I know, isn't he great?"
128,Rachel,"It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know?"
129,Rachel,"There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum."
130,Ross,"Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something."
131,Rachel,"Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?"
132,Ross,Oh!
133,Rachel,What was that?
134,Ross,Monica knows.
135,Monica,It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents.
136,Monica,"It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it."
137,Monica,"I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother."
138,Ross,"Well, I'm gonna go get ready,  for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head."
139,Phoebe,"Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour."
140,Phoebe,"Hey,  you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me."
141,Phoebe,"Ooh,  My sticky shoes--eww!"
142,Phoebe,Eww!
143,Phoebe,I lost my sexy phlegm!

169,Monica,Oh come on!
170,Monica,You're making it sound worse than it actually was.
171,Ross,Her date tipped me ten dollars.
172,Ross,"Pheebs, what are you doing?"
173,Phoebe,"Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold."
174,Phoebe,"It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common."
175,Monica,"Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia."
176,Chandler,Okay.
177,Chandler,You were right.
178,Chandler,I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
179,Phoebe,What?
180,Ross,Are you serious?
181,Phoebe,"Well, how-how-how is that possible?"
182,Phoebe,You barely know her!
183,Chandler,I don't know.
184,Chandler,"I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head."
185,Chandler,Y'know?
186,Chandler,"I mean, I'm a very bad person."
187,Chandler,"I'm a very, very bad person."
188,Chandler,I'm a horrible person.
189,Chandler,No you're not Chandler!
190,Chandler,We still love you Chandler!
191,Monica,"Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold."
192,Phoebe,You mean you stole it!
193,Phoebe,Don't cover your mouth when you do that!
194,Joey,Hey.
195,Chandler,Really?
196,Joey,"Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet."
197,Chandler,Right in there!
198,Chandler,99...100!
199,Chandler,"Ready or not, here I come!"
200,Chandler,"All right, let's go over the concept one more time."
201,Joey,Hey!
202,Chandler,Hey!
203,Joey,Hey guys.
204,Joey,"Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?"
205,Chandler,"Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate."
206,Joey,It's
207,Chandler,"Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know."
208,Chandler,So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
209,Joey,"Okay, I see what's going on here."
210,Chandler,You-you do?
211,Joey,Yeah!
212,Joey,You don't like Kathy.
213,Chandler,You got me.
214,Joey,"Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out."
215,Joey,"Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us."
216,Joey,Right?
217,Chandler,Yeah.
218,Chandler,Right.
219,Joey,"Good, and hey!"
220,Joey,My treat.
221,Joey,"But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?"
222,Chandler,Okay.
223,Monica,Ross isn't here.
224,Rachel,Oh.
225,Rachel,Stop it!
226,Rachel,Yeah!
227,Rachel,I am soo gonna marry that guy.
228,Rachel,Ohhh!
229,Monica,What?
230,Rachel,I think he's stealing from me.
231,Monica,Why?
232,Rachel,Because he's stealing from me!
233,Phoebe,Hi!
234,Phoebe,It's me.
235,Phoebe,And soup.
236,Phoebe,"Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket."
237,Rachel,Ughh!
238,Phoebe,"Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup."
239,Phoebe,"And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water."
240,Monica,Thank you so much Phoebe.
241,Phoebe,Sure.
242,Monica,What are you doing with those?
243,Phoebe,"But, I need your germs!"
244,Phoebe,I want my cold back!
245,Phoebe,I miss my sexy voice.
246,Monica,"Sorry, Phoebe."
247,Phoebe,It's okay.
248,Phoebe,How's the soup?
249,Monica,Umm.
250,Monica,Ohhhh!!
251,Monica,Gross!
252,Joey,Is she great or what?
253,Chandler,"Ohh, she's-she's not really my type."
254,Chandler,Y'know what I think it is?
255,Chandler,It's the fishnet stockings.
256,Chandler,Y'know?
257,Chandler,Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
258,Chandler,"Uhh, no-no thanks."
259,Chandler,"Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer."
260,Joey,I'll be right back.
261,Joey,What was that?
262,Chandler,What?
263,Joey,Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away.
264,Joey,I thought we had a deal.
265,Chandler,"Hey, look, what do you want from me?"
266,Joey,I want you to like her!
267,Joey,"But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend."
268,Chandler,I am pretending.
269,Joey,"Well then, do it better!"
270,Chandler,"Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her?"
271,Chandler,"No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her."
272,Chandler,That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her.
273,Chandler,"That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!"
274,Joey,"Well, that's pretty good."
275,Joey,But you might wanna tone it down a little.
276,Ross,Hey!
277,Ross,"So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off."
278,Ross,"Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive."
279,Ross,"So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?"
280,Monica,"No, sorry."
281,Rachel,Well where's Amanda?
282,Monica,"Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?"
283,Rachel,"I mean y'know, I'm thinking."
284,Rachel,"You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out."
285,Monica,"Ross, cough drops, please?"
286,Ross,At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
287,Rachel,Why don't you just marry her?
288,Rachel,"Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian."
289,Ross,You see Amanda and I have a very special...
290,Monica,You have nothing!
291,Monica,You're not even going out!
292,Monica,You're her baby sitter!
293,Monica,You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
294,Rachel,"Ohh, that is soo sad."
295,Monica,"And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'"
296,Rachel,"Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me!"
297,Rachel,At least he bought me something with it!
298,Monica,That's mine!!
299,Monica,"Now, would you both please start acting like adults?"
300,Monica,And get me my cough drops!
301,Ross,Fine.
302,Rachel,Sorry.
303,Ross,Here.
304,Ross,At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.
305,Rachel,Y'know...
306,Phoebe,Platting goats are platting.
307,Phoebe,Platting down the street.
308,Phoebe,"Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats."
309,Phoebe,Does it even work without my sexy voice?
310,Phoebe,"Gunther, kiss me."
311,Joey,Hey!
312,Joey,"Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?"
313,Chandler,Can I sleep on your couch?
314,Chandler,Closing Credits
315,Phoebe,And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man.
316,Phoebe,Thank you my babies.
317,Rachel,Yeah.
318,Rachel,No!
319,Rachel,Okay.
320,Rachel,Okay.
