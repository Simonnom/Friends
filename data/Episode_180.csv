177,Rachel,"Oh, I don't know."
178,Rachel,I guess we have to eat.
179,Phoebe,"Yeah, I do."
180,Phoebe,What's the matter?
181,Rachel,I'm just bummed about the way I left things with Ross.
182,Rachel,I shouldn't have lied to him about having to work.
183,Rachel,He seemed so mad at me.
184,Phoebe,"Eh, don't be so hard on yourself."
185,Phoebe,If someone I was still in love with was getting married
186,Rachel,Still in love with?
187,Phoebe,Yeah!
188,Rachel,I'm not in love with Ross!
189,Phoebe,Oh.
190,Phoebe,No.
191,Phoebe,No.
192,Phoebe,Good!
193,Phoebe,"Yeah, me neither."
194,Rachel,"Phoebe, I'm going to Ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable."
195,Rachel,"Not because, I'm still in love with him!"
196,Rachel,"I mean, hey, y'know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y'know?"
197,Rachel,"Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love!"
198,Rachel,"I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross."
199,Rachel,Yeah!
200,Rachel,"But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that I'm still in love with him."
201,Rachel,Y'know?
202,Rachel,"I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love himOhh!"
203,Rachel,Oh my God!
204,Rachel,Oh mywhy didn't you tell me?!
205,Phoebe,We thought you knew!
206,Rachel,We?
207,Phoebe,"Yeah, we all know!"
208,Phoebe,We talk about it all the time!
209,Rachel,You all know?
210,Rachel,Does Ross know?
211,Phoebe,"Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything."
212,Rachel,"Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!"
213,Phoebe,"Well, because we thought you knew!!"
214,Phoebe,It's so obvious!
215,Phoebe,"God, that would be like telling Monica, ""Hey, you like things clean."""
216,Joey,Hey!
217,Joey,The
218,Joey,Check this out?
219,Joey,Huh?
220,Joey,Yeah.
221,Joey,That's the stuff.
222,Joey,What do you think?
223,Chandler,"Well, I don't have to buy that, ""I'm with stupid"" T-shirt anymore."
224,Joey,"Well, I like it."
225,Joey,Here you go.
226,Chandler,"All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you?"
227,Chandler,Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
228,Joey,"Oh, I embarrass you?"
229,Chandler,How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
230,Chandler,The
231,Chandler,Oh really?
232,Chandler,Then how come no one here is wearing them?
233,Chandler,The
234,Chandler,"All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself."
235,Joey,Oh yeah?
236,Joey,If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat?
237,Joey,I choose the hat.
238,Joey,The
239,Joey,Thanks.
240,Chandler,"Okay, wait."
241,Chandler,"All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here."
242,Chandler,I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
243,Ross,Hey!
244,Ross,"I just spoke to your dad, and you know what?"
245,Ross,He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
246,Ross,Whoa-whoa-what?
247,Ross,You found a place?
248,Ross,She said what?
249,Ross,Postpone it?
250,Ross,"Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding?"
251,Ross,"Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?"
252,Ross,This isn't right.
253,Ross,I can't ask people to do that?
254,Ross,Would you ask people to do that?
255,Ross,The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option.
256,Ross,This is when we're getting married.
257,Ross,No.
258,Ross,I'm saying it's now.
259,Ross,There's no or' in mind.
260,Ross,What is wrong with these pants?!
261,Ross,"No, wait!"
262,Ross,Emily!
263,Ross,"No, wait, stop!"
264,Ross,"Emily, please Commercial Break"
265,Phoebe,Hey!
266,Rachel,Hi.
267,Phoebe,"So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?"
268,Rachel,Manhattan does not have enough stores.
269,Phoebe,"Well, I think I can help you get over him."
270,Rachel,You can?
271,Phoebe,Yeah.
272,Phoebe,I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
273,Rachel,Um-hmm.
274,Phoebe,And a small piece of chocolate.
275,Rachel,Okay.
276,Phoebe,And a glass of tepid water.
277,Rachel,"Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?"
278,Phoebe,"Uh, only if you have the hiccups too."
279,Phoebe,"Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me."
280,Phoebe,I just didn't feel like getting up.
281,Phoebe,"Okay, I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross."
282,Phoebe,Okay?
283,Phoebe,And you're going to remember all of the bad things about him.
284,Phoebe,All right?
285,Phoebe,Really focus on his flaws.
286,Rachel,I can do that.
287,Rachel,I certainly did it when we were going out.
288,Phoebe,Okay.
289,Phoebe,"Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he's such a great guy."
290,Phoebe,Here.
291,Phoebe,"Okay, now, close your eyes."
292,Phoebe,And imagine that you're with Ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him.
293,Phoebe,And you're-you're running your hands all over his body.
294,Phoebe,"And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it'suck!"
295,Phoebe,Hah?
296,Rachel,"I don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy."
297,Phoebe,"Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought."
298,Phoebe,"Umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy."
299,Rachel,Okay.
300,Phoebe,Okay?
301,Rachel,All right.
302,Phoebe,"So uh, now look at the picture"
303,Rachel,Okay.
304,Phoebe,"All right, and umm"
305,Rachel,Ow!
306,Phoebe,"Okay, how do you feel now?"
307,Rachel,"Well, I like you less!"
308,Joey,Hey.
309,Chandler,Hey.
310,Joey,Oh.
311,Joey,Sorry!
312,Chandler,"No-no-no, y'know what?"
313,Chandler,"I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool."
314,Chandler,"And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day."
315,Joey,Me too.
316,Chandler,Yeah?
317,Joey,Noo!!
318,Joey,I've had the best day ever!
319,Joey,"Dude, check this out!"
320,Monica,Hey!
321,Joey,Sh-shh-shh!
322,Joey,"Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat."
323,Joey,"Oh, Chandler."
324,Chandler,That's That's was
325,Monica,Oh my God!
326,Joey,That's Fergie baby!
327,Chandler,How did you?
328,Chandler,How?
329,Chandler,How?
330,Joey,"Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right?"
331,Joey,"So, I'm in my map and-and Hey!"
332,Monica,Hey!
333,Ross,Hi.
334,Ross,I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
335,Monica,"Yes, I did!"
336,Monica,And you are welcome!
337,Ross,Am I?!
338,Ross,And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?
339,Monica,Umm
340,Chandler,I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
341,Joey,Wait up!
342,Ross,"Hey-hey, since you're the fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?"
343,Monica,She said that?
344,Ross,Yeah.
345,Monica,Why?
346,Ross,"I don't know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out."
347,Monica,Oh my God.
348,Monica,You're even dumber than I am!
349,Ross,Excuse me?
350,Monica,"Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?"
351,Ross,I don't know.
352,Ross,A month?
353,Monica,Emily has probably been planning it since she was five!
354,Monica,Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head.
355,Monica,That's what we did!
356,Monica,"We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top."
357,Monica,Thanks.
358,Monica,But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
359,Ross,I had no idea.
360,Ross,"And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun."
361,Monica,Sometimes we were.
362,Ross,Come on.
363,Ross,You gotta help me figure out what to do.
364,Ross,Okay?
365,Monica,Okay.
366,Ross,Come on.
367,Chandler,That was pretty intense huh?
368,Joey,Yeah.
369,Joey,"Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!"
370,Chandler,I hope he did!
371,Phoebe,Hello.
372,Joey,"Hey, Pheebs!"
373,Joey,It's Joey!
374,Phoebe,"Hey, Joey!"
375,Phoebe,Hey!
376,Phoebe,Ooh!
377,Phoebe,Ooh!
378,Phoebe,I just say someone on thethat looks just like you on the subway.
379,Phoebe,And I was gonna go over and say hi!'
380,Phoebe,"but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you."
381,Joey,That just cost me four bucks.
382,Joey,"But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?"
383,Phoebe,"Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe!"
384,Phoebe,Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all.
385,Phoebe,"So, do you miss me?"
386,Joey,"Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun."
387,Phoebe,So you're not homesick yet?
388,Joey,"No, I don't think so."
389,Phoebe,"All right, the seven of us miss you."
390,Joey,Who's seven?
391,Phoebe,"Y'know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies"
392,Joey,"Ahh, the babies miss me?"
393,Phoebe,"Ooh, the pizza guy's here!"
394,Joey,What?
395,Joey,You ordered pizza without me?
396,Phoebe,Yeah.
397,Phoebe,"But y'know we were thinking about you, y'know we ordered the Joey Special."
398,Joey,Two pizzas?
399,Phoebe,Yep!
400,Phoebe,"Okay, gotta go, talk to you later."
401,Joey,"Wait, well, where did you get it from?"
402,Monica,You'll see.
403,Ross,Okay?
404,Ross,"But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay?"
405,Ross,"And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles"
406,Monica,"And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay?"
407,Monica,"And the chairs can face this way , and  You go."
408,Ross,"But-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time."
409,Ross,"Really, it's fine, whatever you want."
410,Ross,"And, I don't know, if it starts to rain"
411,Monica,Ohh.
412,Monica,And I don't even have a date.
413,Rachel,Pheebs?
414,Phoebe,Yeah?
415,Rachel,Do you remember where the duck food is?
416,Phoebe,"Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink."
417,Phoebe,Why?
418,Rachel,Because I'm going to London.
419,Phoebe,What?!
420,Phoebe,What do you mean you're going to London?
421,Rachel,"Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him."
422,Rachel,"Now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies until I get back."
423,Phoebe,"IRachel, you can't go!"
424,Phoebe,Ross loves Emily!
425,Rachel,"Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does."
426,Rachel,But I have to tell him how I feel!
427,Rachel,He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
428,Phoebe,That's not why you're going!
429,Phoebe,"You're going because you hope he's gonna say, ""Yeah, I love you too, Rach."
430,Phoebe,"Forget that British chippy."""
431,Rachel,OhhDo you think he will?
432,Phoebe,No!
433,Phoebe,Because he's in love with the British chippy!
434,Phoebe,"Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding!"
435,Phoebe,"Y'know, it's too late!"
436,Phoebe,You missed you're chance!
437,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over."
438,Rachel,Y'know what?
439,Rachel,No.
440,Rachel,"It's not over until someone says, ""I do."""
441,Phoebe,I do!
442,Phoebe,I do!
443,Phoebe,I do!
444,Phoebe,I do!

451,Phoebe,"No no no, I'll be nice, I swear!!!"
452,Phoebe,Could you just give me the number for where they are?
453,Phoebe,"Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay."
454,Phoebe,"And I have to warn somebody, alright."
455,Phoebe,So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.
456,Phoebe,"Hello, Hello."
