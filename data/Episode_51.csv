0,Rachel,Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever!
1,Rachel,I think you killed us.
2,Ross,I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
3,Joey,I need something sweet.
4,Phoebe,Does anyone wanna watch TV?
5,Phoebe,Monica your remote doesn't work.
6,Monica,"Phoebe, you have to lift it and point."
7,Phoebe,Oh.
8,Phoebe,"Aw, forget it."
9,Rachel,"Yeah, you know what we should all do?"
10,Rachel,We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.
11,Joey,"Ooh-ooh, I!"
12,Joey,I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
13,Monica,That's very nice.
14,Chandler,"That's sweet, Joey."
15,Joey,"Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up."
16,Joey,Oh!
17,Joey,"Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs."
18,Joey,(Note
19,Joey,"I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering."
20,Joey,"I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material!"
21,Joey,And the way they play with your mind!
22,Joey,Is it there?
23,Joey,Is it not there?
24,Chandler,Are you aware that you're still talking?
25,Monica,Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
26,Ross,"Huh, I don't know what to pick."
27,Ross,Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction?
28,Ross,Hmm.
29,Phoebe,Wow!
30,Phoebe,"See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything."
31,Ross,I'm sorry.
32,Ross,It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
33,Chandler,No-no-no!
34,Chandler,I am the king of bad Thanksgivings.
35,Chandler,You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
36,Rachel,"Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?"
37,Ross,"Oh God, no."
38,Joey,"Oh, come on!"
39,Joey,I wanna hear it!
40,Joey,It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
41,Chandler,"It's a tradition, like the parade."
42,Chandler,"If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family."
43,Chandler,Thanksgiving 1978
44,Ross,You're right.
45,Ross,Yours is worse.
46,Ross,You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
47,Phoebe,I don't know about that.
48,Phoebe,I've got one that's worse.
49,Chandler,Really?
50,Chandler,"Worse than, ""More turkey Mr."
51,Chandler,"Chandler?"""
52,Phoebe,"Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler?"
53,Phoebe,"Yes, mine's worse!"
54,Phoebe,Thanksgiving 1862

60,Ross,"In this life, Phoebe."
61,Phoebe,"Oh, this life!"
62,Phoebe,"Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse."
63,Joey,"Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that!"
64,Joey,I don't have any past life memories.
65,Phoebe,Of course you don't sweetie.
66,Phoebe,You're brand new.
67,Rachel,I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
68,Monica,"Oh, let's not tell this story."
69,Phoebe,"Oh no, I know!"
70,Phoebe,I know!
71,Phoebe,It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!
72,Rachel,What?!
73,Rachel,Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?
74,Joey,"Hey, it's not like it sounds."
75,Chandler,It's exactly like it sounds.

92,Joey,Well then help me get it off!
93,Joey,"Plus, it smells really bad in here."
94,Phoebe,"Well, of course it smells really bad."
95,Phoebe,You have your head up a dead animal.
96,Monica,Hey!
97,Phoebe,Hey!
98,Monica,"Hey, did you get the turkey bastedOh my God!"
99,Monica,Oh my God!
100,Monica,Who is that?
101,Joey,It's Joey.
102,Monica,What-what are you doing?
103,Monica,Is this supposed to be funny?
104,Phoebe,"No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary."
105,Monica,"Well, get it off now!"
106,Joey,I can't!
107,Joey,It-it's stuck!
108,Monica,"Well, I don't care!"
109,Monica,That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
110,Phoebe,"All right, hold on!"
111,Phoebe,"Okay, let's just all think."
112,Monica,"Okay, I got it."
113,Monica,Phoebe?
114,Monica,"All right, you pull."

130,Joey,I scared you!
131,Joey,Present Day
132,Chandler,You did look like an idiot.
133,Joey,"Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot."
134,Joey,All right?
135,Joey,"Remember when Ross tried to say, ""Butternut squash?"""
136,Joey,"And it came out, ""Squatternut buash?"""
137,Ross,Yeah that's the same.
138,Monica,That's it.
139,Monica,That's my worse Thanksgiving.
140,Phoebe,Oh wait!
141,Phoebe,That can't be the one Rachel's talking about.
142,Phoebe,She didn't even know that happened.
143,Phoebe,So which one was it?
144,Monica,"Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story."
145,Chandler,"Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about."
146,Chandler,"Y'know, for me anyway."
147,Chandler,"And of course, the Indians."
148,Monica,"Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!"

164,Rachel,It really creeps me out when you call it that!

315,Rachel,That was so awesome!
316,Rachel,You totally got him back for calling you fat!
317,Rachel,He was just drooling all over you.
318,Rachel,That must've felt so great!
319,Monica,Well it didn't!
320,Rachel,What?
321,Monica,"Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great."
322,Monica,"Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore!"
323,Monica,"Blah, blah, blah!"
324,Monica,"Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know?"
325,Monica,I just want to humiliate him.
326,Monica,"I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!"
327,Rachel,"Okay, that we may be able to do."
328,Monica,How?
329,Rachel,Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
330,Monica,What?!
331,Monica,"I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!"
332,Rachel,"Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it."
333,Rachel,"Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him!"
334,Rachel,You're just gonna make him think that you are.
335,Monica,Yeah.
336,Rachel,Yeah.
337,Monica,And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
338,Rachel,"Then, you will definitely get him back!"
339,Monica,"Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?"
340,Rachel,"Okay, oh, here's what you do."
341,Rachel,Just act like everything around you turns you on.
342,Monica,What do you mean?
343,Rachel,"Well, like anything can be sexy."
344,Rachel,"Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel!"
345,Rachel,"Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek!"
346,Rachel,"And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it."
347,Rachel,Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.
348,Monica,I can do that!
349,Rachel,Yeah?
350,Rachel,Okay!
351,Rachel,"Good, good, because he's coming."
352,Rachel,He's coming.
353,Rachel,"Hey, what's up?"
354,Chandler,"Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year."
355,Monica,"Umm, I'd love too!"
356,Monica,"Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese."
357,Monica,I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
358,Chandler,Okay.
359,Monica,"Boy, I love carrots!"
360,Monica,Oh!
361,Monica,Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you.
362,Monica,"Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife  and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm,  my body."
363,Chandler,Are you all right?
364,Monica,"Oh yeah, of course."
365,Monica,I'm fine it's just that
366,Ross,Can you please not do that feet first?

386,Monica,"Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!"
387,Monica,Mr.
388,Chandler,That's why I lost my toe?!
389,Chandler,Because I called you fat?
390,Monica,I didn't mean to cut it off.
391,Monica,It was an accident.
392,Chandler,That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?
393,Monica,I'm sorry!
394,Monica,It wasn't your whole toe!
395,Chandler,"Yeah, well, I miss the tip!"
396,Chandler,It's the best part.
397,Chandler,It has the nail.
398,Monica,Chandler!
399,Ross,"Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that."
400,Joey,You're a dork.
401,Chandler,I can't believe this.

403,Chandler,"Yeah, well, sorry doesn't bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home!"
404,Chandler,I hate this stupid day!
405,Chandler,And everything about it!
406,Chandler,I'll see you later.
407,Monica,"Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do?"
408,Monica,Anything?
409,Chandler,"Yeah, just leave me alone for a while."
