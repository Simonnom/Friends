4,Phoebe,I'm so sick of being pregnant!
5,Phoebe,"The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, causeOh!"

106,Chandler,"Oh, I'm Ross."
107,Chandler,I'm Ross.
108,Chandler,I'm too good for the Hut; I'm too good for the Hut.
109,Ross,"Look, I gotta go pick up Ben."

130,Rachel,Huh.
131,Rachel,"Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them."
132,Monica,Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
133,Rachel,Oh my God!
134,Rachel,We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
135,Monica,Wait a minute!
136,Monica,"Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant."
137,Monica,"Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila."
138,Rachel,"Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted!"
139,Monica,"Oh, she's gonna love that!"
140,Phoebe,What the hell is this?!
141,Phoebe,"What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can't use for another two months?!"

208,Joey,"Dude, this isn't funny!"
209,Joey,What am I gonna do?!
210,Joey,"I go to bed last night, everything's cool!"
211,Joey,"I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone!"

213,Joey,Of course!
214,Phoebe,"Hi, guys."
215,Rachel,Hi!
216,Rachel,Phoebe.
217,Monica,Hi Phoebe.
218,Phoebe,I-I wanted to apologise if Iy'know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower.
219,Phoebe,"Y'know it's just the hormones, y'know."
220,Rachel,No we
221,Monica,Hormones.
222,Rachel,"hormones, yeah."
223,Phoebe,"Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet."
224,Monica,"Wow, you seem to be doing so much better."
225,Monica,That's great.
226,Monica,So how-how are things going?
227,Phoebe,Good.
228,Phoebe,"Y'knowno-no, okay, it's-it feels like everything's been about me lately, so what's happening with you?"
229,Rachel,"Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding."
230,Phoebe,Oh!
231,Rachel,"It just might be too hard, given the history and all that"
232,Phoebe,Wow!
233,Phoebe,"This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him."
234,Rachel,"Well, h-how is this like that?"
235,Phoebe,"Well, let's see, it's not."
236,Phoebe,"Really, like that."
237,Phoebe,"Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y'know a bunch of y'know high school crap that nobody really gives y'know"
238,Rachel,"I'm-I'm sorry, I just thought that"
239,Phoebe,"Alrighty, here come the water works."
240,Joey,Ugh!
241,Joey,I don't know what I'm going to do!
242,Joey,I called the company that sent and th-they don't care!
243,Joey,"Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?"
244,Ross,Hey guys!
245,Chandler,Hey!
246,Joey,Hey
247,Ross,"I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!"
248,Ross,And the guys from work had a blast.
249,Ross,"Y'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before."
250,Ross,Yeah!
251,Ross,"And-and another one had never been to a party before, so"
252,Joey,"So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh?"
253,Joey,"Man, that's nice!"
254,Ross,"Yeah, right!"
255,Joey,"I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those"
256,Ross,That ring?
257,Ross,"When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her."
258,Chandler,"So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?"
259,Ross,Oh absolutely!
260,Ross,"It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life."
261,Chandler,"So you might say, it's a magic ring."
262,Joey,"Yeah, the stripper stole it."
263,Ross,My-my ring?
264,Ross,My-my wedding ring?
265,Ross,The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?!
266,Ross,H-how?!
267,Ross,How could this all happen?
268,Chandler,"Well, I think it all started when you said, ""Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man."""
269,Ross,"All right-all right, fine!"
270,Ross,I-I'm gonna call the cops!
271,Joey,"Dude, I screwed up, you don't have to turn me in!"
272,Ross,Not on you!
273,Ross,On the stripper!
274,Joey,"Oh, yeah, well I already did that!"
275,Joey,They said they're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.
276,Ross,"Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her!"
277,Joey,I did that too!
278,Joey,They wouldn't give me her real name or her number.
279,Joey,"They said, ""If I bothered them again they'd call the police."""
280,Joey,"I said, ""If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!"""
281,Ross,"So what, Joey?"
282,Ross,Wh-wh-what?
283,Ross,What are you telling me?
284,Ross,That there's nothing we can do?
285,Ross,"Well, how could this happen?"
286,Joey,"Look Ross, I am so-so sorry."
287,Joey,I-I-I
288,Chandler,"Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?"
289,Joey,"Oh, that sounds like fun, but we've got a ring to find!"
290,Monica,Here's your tea Phoebe.
291,Phoebe,It's so good.
292,Phoebe,"Oh, thanks."
293,Rachel,Good.
294,Monica,I'm so glad you liked it.
295,Phoebe,Oh!
296,Monica,What?
297,Rachel,What?!
298,Rachel,She made the tea!
299,Phoebe,Oh!
300,Phoebe,"No, I-I think I just had a contraction."
301,Rachel,You what?
302,Monica,Oh my God!
303,Phoebe,"Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one."
304,Monica,"Wait, you can't have the baby here!"
305,Monica,I mean I haven't sterilised it since the guys moved out!
306,Rachel,Okay.
307,Rachel,It's okay.
308,Rachel,We're gonna be okay.
309,Rachel,Y'know what?
310,Rachel,It's okay.
311,Rachel,"I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!"
312,Phoebe,No.
313,Phoebe,It's all right; it's probably false labour.
314,Phoebe,"They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book."
315,Monica,"Rachel, get the book!"
316,Monica,The book!
317,Rachel,Okay!
318,Rachel,Okay!
319,Rachel,Here!
320,Monica,The Bible?
321,Rachel,I don't know!
322,Joey,"All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk."
323,Joey,"And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won't recognise you because, well, why would she?"
324,Joey,"Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I."
325,Joey,"You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be uh, Mr. Wong."
326,Ross,Diverse.
327,Ross,The
328,Chandler,You be cool.
329,Chandler,The
330,Ross,Where's my ring?
331,Ross,My dead grandmother's wedding ring?
332,Ross,Where is it?
333,Ross,Where is it?
334,Chandler,"Way to be cool, man."
335,Chandler,The
336,Joey,"There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!"
337,Joey,The
338,Ross,We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
339,Ross,The
340,Chandler,Marry me.
341,Joey,I don't get it!
342,Joey,It was in my room all night!
343,Joey,"And if she didn't take it, and I didn't take it; and you  didn't take it, then who did?"
344,Joey,Shh!
345,Joey,We're trying to think!
346,Rachel,I still don't get how you know when it's false labour.
347,Phoebe,"Well, do you see any babies?"
348,Monica,How do you feel?
349,Phoebe,"Okay, I guess."
350,Phoebe,"I mean I don't know, it's just, I guess I know it's going to be over soon."
351,Rachel,"Well, isn't that a good thing?"
352,Rachel,You said you were sick of this.
353,Phoebe,I know.
354,Phoebe,"It's just y'know usually when you're, when you're done with the pregnant thing, y'know, then you get to do the mom thing."
355,Phoebe,"I'm gonna be y'know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila."
356,Monica,Some moms do that.
357,Phoebe,Okay that's even sadder.
358,Phoebe,"Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it's just that now that they're in me it's like, it's like I know them y'know, I mean-I mean, it's just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away."
359,Monica,"Aww, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything."
360,Monica,"You're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better."
361,Phoebe,"Yeah, okay."
362,Rachel,"No, really."
363,Rachel,"Really, Pheebs, you're not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they're bad, y'know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down."
364,Rachel,Y'know?
365,Monica,"I mean, you're the one they're gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex."
366,Rachel,And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
367,Phoebe,Cool Aunt Phoebe.
368,Phoebe,I am pretty cool!
369,Monica,Yeah.
370,Rachel,"And y'know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you."

389,Joey,So!
390,Joey,Things can go wrong!
391,Joey,You don't know!
392,Joey,What if he doesn't make it?
393,Chandler,"He will, Joe."
394,Joey,"Yeah, but what if he doesn't?"
