106,Phoebe,No wait two!
107,Phoebe,Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
108,Chandler,"Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!"
109,Joey,You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
110,Chandler,Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
111,Monica,Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying!
112,Monica,I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.
113,Chandler,I'm not macho.
114,Monica,Yeah you're right.
115,Monica,I don't know what I was thinking.
116,Chandler,"No, I guess I just never really cried."
117,Chandler,Y'know?
118,Chandler,I'm not a crying kind of guy.
119,Joey,Come on man there's gotta be something that gets you choked up!
120,Joey,"Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?"
121,Chandler,"I'd be sad sure, but I wouldn't cry."
122,Joey,"Okay, what if the puppy said, ""Help me Chandler."
123,Joey,"All the other puppies pick on me."""

175,Rachel,Oh!
176,Rachel,There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob!
177,Rachel,He's a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
178,Rachel,"It's not random, it's Bob."

188,Rachel,I'm not telling you what to do!
189,Rachel,I am telling you what not to do!

193,Rachel,"All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!"
194,Rachel,In Human Resources!!!!!

216,Joey,Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
217,Ross,"And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn't know he was in there."
218,Rachel,Wow!
219,Rachel,"I mean, I justI can't, I can't believe this."
220,Rachel,"Y'know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who's always been somewhat of a question mark."
221,Monica,This is so bizarre.
222,Monica,"I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood."
223,Chandler,"Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn."
224,Monica,"Yes, but you are dead inside."
225,Joey,"All right well, I'd better take that back."
226,Monica,"Wh-what, why?"
227,Joey,We can't watch that!
228,Joey,I mean that's Phoebe!
229,Monica,"Yeah you're right, we can'twe shouldn't watch this."
230,Rachel,Absolutely not.
231,Monica,Y'know maybe a little bit!
232,Rachel,Probably just the first half.
233,Joey,No!
234,Joey,Hey no!
235,Joey,This is wrong you guys!
236,Joey,Phoebe's our friend!
237,Joey,"Well, I'm not gonna watch it!"

242,Joey,"Suddenly, the vampire opens his coffin and sits up."
243,Joey,"Buffay, the Vampire"
244,Monica,Hold on a second!
245,Monica,What is that on her ankle?
246,Chandler,Her ankle is what you're watching?
247,Rachel,"Well it's hard to tell  Oh God, if she would just stop moving."
248,Chandler,She's just doing her job!
249,Joey,You sick bastards!
250,Rachel,"Oh, it's a tattoo!"
251,Rachel,"That's weird, Phoebe doesn't Wait that's Ursula!"
252,Rachel,That's not Phoebe that is Ursula!

265,Monica,Chicken Soup for the Soul?
266,Chandler,There's no back to this couch!
267,Monica,Why are you reading this?
268,Monica,You hate this kind of stuff.
269,Chandler,"Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know?"
270,Chandler,"Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside."
271,Monica,Oh that's so sweet!
272,Monica,"Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you."
273,Chandler,Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
274,Monica,Stop it!
275,Chandler,"No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this."
276,Monica,"I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here."
277,Chandler,Yeah?
278,Monica,Yeah!
279,Monica,"And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what!"
280,Monica,"And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me."
281,Chandler,"Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then."
282,Monica,"And-and-and if I die, from a long illness."
283,Monica,"And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, ""I will always be with you,"" and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside."
284,Chandler,"Aww, I love you so"
285,Monica,What is wrong with you?!!
286,Chandler,What?
287,Monica,What?!
288,Monica,You can't shed a tear for your dead wife!!
289,Monica,"Now, I left you a note from the beyond!"
290,Chandler,So you didn't mean any of that?
291,Monica,No you robot!
292,Ross,You damn kids!
293,Ross,"You ring my bell one more time, I swear to  Ohh, uh Jill."
294,Ross,"Umm, that-that's just a little game I play with the kids down the hall."
295,Ross,"Umm, they've really taken a liking to me."
296,Ross,Uhh what's-what's-what's the matter?
297,Ross,"Of course, what happened?"
298,Ross,"Okay, umm"
299,Ross,What?
300,Ross,Wow!
301,Ross,Really?
302,Ross,"Well, I'd love to!"
303,Ross,"Here, you wait right here and I'll go get the projector and my notes!"
304,Ross,Ohh!
305,Ross,(He goes into another room to get his projector and notes.
306,Ross,"While he's gone, Jill quickly checks her makeup."
307,Rachel,Hey!
308,Rachel,Have you guys seen Jill?
309,Rachel,I can't find her anywhere.
310,Monica,"No, I haven't."
311,Rachel,"Well, is Ross home?"
312,Rachel,Maybe I'll just call him to see if he's actually seen her.
313,Phoebe,It's Phoebe!
314,Phoebe,Phoebe!
315,Phoebe,Oh God.
316,Phoebe,So-so you're making porn movies.
317,Phoebe,You're making one right now!
318,Phoebe,Another Man's
319,Phoebe,And-and you're using my name!
320,Phoebe,"Look, I'm talking right now!"
321,Phoebe,You'reyou mean her.
322,Phoebe,What?
323,Phoebe,No!!
324,Phoebe,No way!
325,Phoebe,No!
326,Phoebe,And stop using my name!
327,Phoebe,And shame on you!
328,Phoebe,And shame on all of you!
329,Phoebe,You're disgusting!
330,Phoebe,Especially you  with that!
331,Ross,Slides are almost ready.
332,Ross,"Uh okay, well there's-there's wine in the kitchen."
333,Ross,Hello?
334,Rachel,What is my sister doing there?!
335,Rachel,And why are the drapes shut?
336,Ross,"O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay?"
337,Ross,She-she's really upset we're just talking.
338,Rachel,Ross!
339,Rachel,I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
340,Ross,So that's the only reason she could be here huh?
341,Ross,It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
342,Rachel,"Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!"
343,Ross,Y'know what?
344,Ross,"I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later."
345,Ross,Good-bye.
346,Ross,Whoa!
347,Ross,"Uh, that was your sister actually."
348,Ross,She-she thinks that you're just using me.
349,Phoebe,Hey!
350,Joey,Hey!
351,Phoebe,"So, I just came from the company Ursula works for."
352,Joey,"Oh no, not you too!"
353,Phoebe,No!
354,Phoebe,No!
355,Phoebe,I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay's checks; there were a lot of them.
356,Joey,Nice!
357,Phoebe,"Um-mmm, and I won't have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address."
358,Joey,"That's great, but isn't it gonna bother that people still think you're a porn star?"
359,Phoebe,Oh no!
360,Phoebe,No!
361,Phoebe,I know how to handle it.
362,Joey,You do?
363,Phoebe,Yeah.
364,Phoebe,You're trying to figure out where you know me from?
365,Phoebe,"All right, I'll give you a hint."
366,Phoebe,From porn!
367,Phoebe,Okay?
368,Phoebe,Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie!
369,Phoebe,See?
370,Joey,Yeah.
371,Chandler,Hey.
372,Ross,"You uh, you may have been right about Jill."
373,Rachel,Oh!
374,Rachel,I knew it!
375,Rachel,What happened?
376,Ross,"Umm, she kissed me."
377,Rachel,What?!
378,Rachel,You kissed!
379,Chandler,Maybe we should give them some privacy.
380,Monica,Shhhh!!
381,Ross,"Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?"
382,Rachel,"Well, it doesn't sound like it!"
383,Rachel,"I mean, it's pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don't kiss them!"
384,Rachel,"See look at us, right now, not kissing!"
385,Ross,"Let me finish, okay?"
386,Ross,She started kissing me and-and I didn't stop it.
387,Ross,I guess I-I just wasn't thinking
388,Rachel,Yeah that's right you weren't thinking!
389,Rachel,Y'know what?
390,Rachel,Let me give you something to think about!
391,Ross,Oh waithold it!
392,Ross,But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
393,Rachel,"Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that."
394,Ross,Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
395,Rachel,What?
396,Ross,"No, I mean, look I don't know if anything is going to happen with us, again."
397,Ross,Ever.
398,Ross,But I don't want to know that it-it never could.
399,Ross,So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
400,Rachel,Wow.
401,Rachel,"I, I don't even know what to say."
402,Rachel,Thank you.
403,Ross,You're welcome.
404,Monica,Oh my God!
405,Monica,Are-are you crying?
406,Chandler,I just don't see why those two can't work things out!
407,Chandler,Ending Credits
408,Rachel,"Yeah, I got that."
409,Ross,You take care Jill.
410,Rachel,Bye-bye-e!
411,Monica,Bye.
412,Chandler,I-I can't believe Jill's gone.
413,Chandler,"I can't help it, I opened a gate."
414,Chandler,End
