100,Rachel,"Oh, you're one of those."
101,Rachel,But y'know what?
102,Rachel,I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.
103,Rachel,"Well y'know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we'd jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they'd put salt on their cereal."
104,Rachel,Yeah?

111,Rachel,"Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge."
112,Rachel,Right?
113,Rachel,"And then you say to person, I bet you can't roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face."
114,Rachel,"And then when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face."
115,Rachel,"Yeah, I-I-I-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid."
116,Rachel,Okay?

222,Chandler,Okay.
223,Monica,Yeah!
224,Joey,"Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so  ""We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share."""

267,Monica,How about receiving?
268,Joey,Yes!
269,Chandler,"See Joe, not that that's not grrreat!"
270,Chandler,"But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us!"
271,Chandler,"Y'know, it can be more personal."
272,Chandler,You can tell stories about us!
273,Joey,"Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?!"
274,Joey,Remember?
275,Chandler,"No, not us  Us!"
276,Monica,I gotcha.
277,Monica,Sorry.
278,Monica,"So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?"
279,Phoebe,Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?
280,Monica,It doesn't say that!
281,Phoebe,Oh!
282,Phoebe,Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
283,Chandler,"See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y'know, romantic stories."
284,Chandler,Nice stories.
285,Joey,Oh.
286,Joey,Okay.
287,Joey,Ooh!

295,Chandler,Joe?
296,Joey,Okay.
297,Joey,All right.
298,Joey,"Umm, so uh, so how did it happen?"
299,Joey,Did your eyes meet across the room?
300,Joey,And then the next thing y'know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?
301,Chandler,Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?
302,Joey,Yeah!!
303,Joey,I call that London style.
304,Monica,No that is not what happened with us.
305,Monica,"Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross's mom."
306,Joey,Oh.
307,Monica,"And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me."
308,Monica,And well we drank too much
309,Joey,Yeah baby!
310,Chandler,And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
311,Joey,Oh.
312,Chandler,But then later that night
313,Joey,Yeah baby!
314,Chandler,Hey!
315,Monica,Cute PJ's!
316,Monica,You're really livin' it up here in London huh?
317,Chandler,Well I was I was exactly expecting company after
318,Monica,Is Joey here?
319,Chandler,"Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride's maid and a bucket of strawberries."
320,Chandler,"So uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?"
321,Monica,Wouldn't you be?
322,Chandler,"Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink."
323,Chandler,And you've just got to let that go okay?
324,Chandler,I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
325,Monica,Really?
326,Chandler,You kidding?
327,Chandler,You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms   Whoa!
328,Chandler,Whoa!
329,Chandler,Whoa!
330,Chandler,What's going on?
331,Chandler,You and I just made out!
332,Chandler,You and I are making out?
333,Monica,"Well, not anymore."
334,Chandler,But we don't do that.
335,Monica,"I know, I just thought it would be fun."
336,Chandler,How drunk are you?
337,Monica,Drunk enough to know that I want to do this.
338,Monica,Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
339,Chandler,That's the perfect amount!
340,Monica,Okay!
341,Monica,Y'know what's weird?
342,Chandler,What?
343,Monica,This doesn't feel weird!
344,Chandler,I know.
345,Monica,You're a really good kisser.
346,Chandler,"Well, I have kissed over four women."
347,Chandler,Do you wanna get under the covers?
348,Monica,Hm-hmm!
349,Chandler,Okay!
350,Monica,Wow!
351,Monica,You are really fast!
352,Chandler,It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
353,Monica,We're gonna see each other naked.
354,Chandler,Yep!
355,Monica,Do you wanna do it at the same time?
356,Chandler,Count of three?
357,Monica,One!
358,Chandler,Two!
359,Monica,Two!
360,Monica,Monica and
361,Chandler,Three!
362,Chandler,Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
363,Monica,"Eh, we weren't that close anyway!"
364,Chandler,Eh!
365,Chandler,Joey!
366,Chandler,Joey!
367,Chandler,Joey!
368,Chandler,J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey!

375,Chandler,No!
376,Joey,Hey no-no-no-no!
377,Joey,It's cool!
378,Joey,It's cool!
379,Joey,"I-I'll only be a second, I'm still with my bride's maid, I justWhere are those condoms you brought?"
380,Chandler,They're in my bag over there.
381,Joey,Ah.
382,Chandler,"Uh, could you leave me one?"
383,Joey,For just you?
384,Chandler,Yeah.
385,Joey,"Hey listen, why don't you come downstairs with me?"
386,Joey,There's some really nice girls down there.
387,Chandler,No I-I-I'm fine.
388,Joey,"All right, here you go buddy."
389,Joey,Go nuts.
390,Joey,That's what that was?!
391,Joey,Cause that other thing?
392,Joey,"I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me."
393,Monica,"Okay, can we change the topic?"
394,Monica,Because it's really doing nothing for me.
395,Joey,Oh  Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one?
396,Joey,You two might've never gotten together.
397,Joey,Ooh-ooh!
398,Joey,Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?!
399,Joey,It's like it was in the stars!
400,Phoebe,"Yeah, it's totally meant to be."
401,Phoebe,Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
402,Monica,What?
403,Chandler,What?
404,Phoebe,What?
405,Chandler,Who did you originally want to hook up with?
406,Monica,"Okay, fine but please don't be upset!"
407,Monica,Okay?
408,Monica,I was really depressed okay?
409,Monica,And really drunk!
410,Monica,I just wanted something stupid and meaningless.
411,Monica,I just wantedjust sex.
412,Monica,"So, when Iwent to your room that nightI was actually lookingfor Joey."
413,Joey,Yeah baby!
414,Joey,No baby!
415,Joey,Commercial Break
416,Chandler,So you came to the room looking for Joey?
417,Chandler,Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
418,Monica,No because it-it didn't seem important.
419,Chandler,"Oh, it's not important?"
420,Chandler,It's not important?!
421,Chandler,If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him  not me!
422,Monica,Noo!!
423,Monica,The point is that is was you that was there that night!
424,Monica,It is you that I am marrying!
425,Monica,It is you that I feel in love with!
426,Joey,And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv
427,Chandler,I don't believe it.
428,Chandler,The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
429,Monica,"Chandler, please!"
430,Monica,Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?
431,Joey,Hey!
432,Joey,"Now I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!"
433,Chandler,Look there is no way you're doing this wedding now.
434,Chandler,Okay?
435,Joey,What?!
436,Joey,That's not fair!
437,Joey,It's not my fault!
438,Joey,I was off with my bride's maid!
439,Joey,And who's to say I would've even said yes?!
440,Joey,I mean I would've said yes.
441,Joey,"Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right?"
442,Joey,"Look, everything worked out okay!"
443,Chandler,"Okay, it's just weird!"
444,Chandler,Okay?
445,Chandler,I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica!
446,Chandler,I-I-I needI don't know what I need.
447,Chandler,I need a walk.
448,Monica,"Wait Chandler come on, let'sit's not a big deal!"
449,Chandler,It is to me.
450,Chandler,"You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin."
451,Joey,This is crazy.
452,Phoebe,I know!
453,Phoebe,Robin is so gay!
454,Rachel,So now what have we agreed?
455,Rachel,And-and what else?
456,Rachel,Very good.
457,Ross,Rachel!

459,Rachel,I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.
460,Ross,Your good friend?
461,Rachel,Yeah!
462,Ross,What's her last name?
463,Rachel,CarolLesbian?
464,Ross,Nice.
465,Ross,"And by the way that uh, that line down my face?"
466,Rachel,What line?
467,Ross,Wh-wh-what line?
468,Ross,"The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh,  ""Dude, don't you ever was your face?"""
469,Rachel,"All right, I'm sorry."
470,Rachel,I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already!
471,Ross,Of course I was mad!
472,Ross,I told you I-I hate this stuff!
473,Ross,Okay?
474,Ross,It-it's not funny!
475,Ross,Hi.
476,Ross,Practical jokes.
477,Ross,You have a line down your face.
478,Rachel,"Okay, maybe they are not funny to you"
479,Rachel,Or Carol!
480,Rachel,But they're funny to kids and who is it hurting?
481,Ross,"Uh, y'know what?"
482,Ross,I'll tell you who it hurts!
483,Ross,It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal's office wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt!
484,Rachel,That was you?!
485,Rachel,We heard about you in Junior High!
486,Rachel,"Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, ""I will be revenged?!"""
487,Ross,I will be!
488,Ross,"Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore."
489,Ross,Okay?
490,Rachel,Fine.
491,Rachel,"Fine, but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel."
492,Rachel,And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!
493,Ross,No that's not what I want.
494,Ross,"Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I"
495,Rachel,"Look he doesn't have any brothers or sisters, somebody's gonna have to teach him this stuff!"
496,Rachel,And I haven't taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn't know anyway!
497,Rachel,I gotta go!
498,Joey,Hey.
499,Chandler,Hey.
500,Chandler,Do you want this scone?
501,Chandler,It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
502,Joey,"Chandler, come on nothing even happened!"
503,Chandler,"Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding"
504,Joey,No-hey-no!
505,Joey,"If you don't want me to do it, I except that."
506,Joey,I don't care about that.
507,Joey,I justI don't want you to be upset.
508,Chandler,How can I not be upset?
509,Chandler,Okay?
510,Chandler,I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
511,Joey,Yeah for like a half an hour one night!
512,Joey,"Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life!"
513,Joey,You're so lucky!
514,Joey,Look what I missed out on by not being there!
515,Joey,Although you know what?
516,Joey,"It could never have worked like you guys did, cause you guys are perfect for each other."
517,Joey,"Y'know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it justit-it fits."
518,Joey,Y'know?
519,Joey,And you just know it's gonna last forever.
520,Chandler,That's what you should say.
521,Joey,What?
522,Chandler,When you're marrying us; that's what you should say.
523,Joey,Really?
524,Joey,I can do it?
525,Chandler,I'd love it if you would do it.
526,Joey,Hey!
527,Chandler,But those are the words!
528,Chandler,Those exact words!
529,Joey,"Well I don't know remember exactly but, it's-it's pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving."
530,Ross,Hey!

532,Ross,"Hey I'm sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit?"
