23,Chandler,You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
24,Monica,"Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends."
25,Rachel,"Oh God, that's right."
26,Rachel,I blocked that out.

32,Chandler,Who?
33,Ross,He was roommates with John Rosoff.
34,Ross,He went out with Andrea Tamburino.
35,Ross,She dumped him for Michael Skloff.

37,Ross,"Hey, there's Missy Goldberg."
38,Ross,You gotta remember her.
39,Chandler,"Sure, nice."
40,Ross,Dude.
41,Ross,You're married to my sister.
42,Chandler,"You're right, by saying ""nice"" I'm virtually licking her."
43,Ross,"Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out?"
44,Chandler,Are you asking permission to break the pact?
45,Ross,Yes please.
46,Ross,Hey.
47,Ross,"Hey, check out the flyers for the band."
48,Ross,I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room!
49,Chandler,"Awesome, the name really stands out."
50,Ross,"Thanks to a little something called ""Helvetica Bold 24 point""!"
51,Chandler,"Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!"
52,Chandler,Hey!
53,Ross,"Hey, Missy..."
54,Chandler,"You know, our band is playing on Friday."

66,Chandler,"You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out."
67,Ross,"Dude, I was gonna ask her out."
68,Chandler,"I said it first, bro."
69,Ross,"Well, I thought it first, Holmes."
70,Chandler,"Look, if you did..."
71,Ross,Woha!
72,Ross,Wait... What are we doing?
73,Ross,What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl.
74,Ross,"I mean, we can get laid anytime we want."
75,Chandler,Totally.
76,Chandler,I had sex in High school...
77,Ross,Me too.
78,Ross,I'm good at it.
79,Chandler,"All right, I'd say we make a pact."
80,Chandler,Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.
81,Ross,You got it.
82,Chandler,"All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with."
83,Ross,Those are the pacts!
84,Chandler,"Oh, and Sheena Easton."
85,Chandler,But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
86,Ross,"Oh, oh... maybe not you!"
87,Chandler,"Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact."
88,Ross,Thank you.
89,Ross,"All right, here I go."
90,Ross,"Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?"
91,Chandler,Your hands are shaking.
92,Ross,"I know, and I can't stop sweating."
93,Joey,"I know it could be intimidating for regular people to be around celebrities but... relax, I'm just like you!"
94,Joey,Only better looking and richer.
95,Joey,Uhm... ok.
96,Joey,"It's a store, like a supermarket."
97,Joey,Oh!
98,Joey,I see-I see what I did.
99,Joey,"Yeah, ok, ok, uhm..."

109,Phoebe,"Oh my God, it's all so elegant!"
110,Phoebe,When's the dirty stuff starting?
111,Rachel,What?
112,Phoebe,"You know, the strippers, and the guys dancing, and you know, pee-pee's flying about."
113,Rachel,"Pheebs, I... there isn't gonna be any flying about!"
114,Rachel,We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.
115,Phoebe,"Oh, ok."
116,Phoebe,"I see what you're doing, that's fine."
117,Phoebe,"This is all there is, just tea, uh, ok.  Hmmmm... raunchy!"
118,Rachel,"Seriously Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party."
119,Phoebe,Really?
120,Phoebe,So this is... this is my big send off in the married life?
121,Phoebe,Rachel this is the only bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have!
122,Phoebe,I've got a big wad of ones in my purse!
123,Phoebe,Really?
124,Phoebe,"I mean, really?"
125,Phoebe,It's just tea?
126,Rachel,Nooo!
127,Rachel,"Phoebe, of course there is more!"
128,Rachel,"I mean, I'll just go and talk to Monica and get an ETA on the pee-pee's!"
129,Joey,"Ahaha, he might as well just give us the points."
130,Joey,A spoon.
131,Joey,Your hands.
132,Joey,Your face!
133,Joey,"Paper, snow, a ghost!"
134,Joey,"A rock, a dog, the earth."

145,Joey,"I'm so sorry, ok?"
146,Joey,"I promise, we'll do better next time!"
147,Joey,"Hey, you know, some of those are pretty hard!"
148,Joey,Like why would there be a ghost in my fridge?
149,Joey,Yeah!
150,Ross,"So, Saturday night!"
151,Ross,Great!
152,Ross,"Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?"
153,Ross,It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
154,Ross,That's ok.
155,Ross,"Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!"
156,Ross,"Yeah, why?"
157,Ross,You did?
158,Ross,AND ON MY TURF?
159,Monica,"Hey, where is this guy, it's been over an hour!"

169,Monica,...If-you-say-so.
170,Phoebe,"Oh, God!"
171,Phoebe,Rachel?
172,Rachel,Yeah?
173,Phoebe,Are you kidding?
174,Rachel,"All right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!"
175,Phoebe,How old is your phonebook?
176,Monica,"Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!"
177,Phoebe,"Oh God no, I don't wanna see him take his clothes off!"
178,Monica,"Oh, no!"
179,Monica,"I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off!"
180,Monica,You big piece of eye candy!
181,Phoebe,This is how I look when I'm turned on!
182,Phoebe,Shocking!
183,Phoebe,"Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?"
184,Rachel,"No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!"
185,Phoebe,"No, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do anything!"
186,Phoebe,I don't care.
187,Phoebe,We're not paying you 300 dollars for this.
188,Phoebe,"Oh yeah, okay."
189,Phoebe,I'm uptight.
190,Phoebe,"Yeah, that's why I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume!"
191,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?"
192,Monica,"Uh, look, officer... uhm Sir..."

203,Ross,You broke the pact!
204,Chandler,"Ross, that was 16 years ago!"
205,Ross,That doesn't matter!
206,Ross,We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.
207,Chandler,I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair.
208,Chandler,"All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts."
209,Ross,I didn't.

329,Monica,What?
330,Monica,When was this?
331,Ross,Nineteen Eighty Seven.
332,Ross,The weekend you guys visited me at school.
333,Monica,Oh my God!
334,Monica,That's wild!
335,Chandler,"Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter."
336,Ross,"Well, it matters to me."
337,Chandler,Why?
338,Ross,Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
339,Chandler,You kissed her that night too?
340,Monica,Two guys in one night?
341,Monica,"Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed."
342,Chandler,"Seriously, where did this happen?"
343,Ross,"Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right."
344,Ross,"She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats."
345,Ross,"Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know."
346,Ross,"But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips."
347,Ross,"I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back."
348,Ross,"It was only for a second, but... it was amazing."
349,Ross,"And now, now I find out that you kissed her first."
350,Chandler,Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
351,Ross,Mine.
352,Chandler,I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
353,Ross,"No, she was definitely on my bed."
354,Chandler,"Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?"
355,Ross,"Well, then who was on my bed?"
356,Monica,OH!
357,Monica,"Oh, oh!"
358,Ross,NO!
359,Ross,"No, no!"
