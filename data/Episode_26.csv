25,Rachel,No!
26,Rachel,Phoebes!

28,Phoebe,"'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!"
29,Monica,"But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year."
30,Monica,I know I do.
31,Rachel,"Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?"
32,Joey,"Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes."
33,Chandler,"Oh, uh, listen, about tonight..."
34,Joey,"No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me."
35,Joey,The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
36,Chandler,"Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a..."
37,Joey,Pathetic mess?
38,Joey,"I know, but혰come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable."
39,Joey,"I'm thinkin', cha-ching!"
40,Joey,Thanks.
41,Joey,"Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice."

58,Joey,Just calm down.
59,Chandler,Calm down?
60,Chandler,Calm down?
61,Chandler,You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
62,Joey,Can you stop yellin'?
63,Joey,"You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous."
64,Chandler,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right."
65,Chandler,"Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!"
66,Rachel,"Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney."
67,Monica,Which one was Pete Carney?
68,Rachel,Pete the Weeper?
69,Rachel,Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex.
70,Rachel,"""Was it good for you?"""
71,Monica,"Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-""I-win""-guy."
72,Monica,"""I win!"
73,Monica,"I win!"""
74,Monica,I went out with the guy for two months혰I didn't get to win once.
75,Rachel,How did we end up with these jerks?
76,Rachel,We're good people!
77,Monica,I don't know.
78,Monica,Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
79,Phoebe,I know I am.
80,Phoebe,That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
81,Monica,"There's more beer, right?"
82,Phoebe,Oh!
83,Phoebe,You know my friend Abby who shaves her head?
84,Phoebe,"She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual."
85,Rachel,"Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald."
86,Phoebe,Yeah.
87,Phoebe,"So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys."
88,Phoebe,It's Valentine's Day.
89,Phoebe,It's perfect.
90,Monica,"Ok, well, what kind of ritual?"
91,Phoebe,"Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us."
92,Rachel,Or?
93,Phoebe,"Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks."
94,Monica,Burning's good.
95,Rachel,Burning's good.
96,Rachel,"Yeah, I got stuff to burn."
97,Joey,Good for you.
98,Joey,"Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?"
99,Chandler,That's OK.
100,Joey,We can't do that.
101,Chandler,What?
102,Chandler,What can't you do?
103,Joey,"Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?"
104,Joey,"Uh, we might be leaving now."
105,Chandler,"Tell me it's ""you and me"" we."
106,Joey,She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off.
107,Joey,"I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it."
108,Chandler,"Ok, you can not do this to me."
109,Joey,"You're right, I'm sorry."
110,Joey,You're right.
111,Joey,I'm outta here.
112,Joey,Here's my credit card.
113,Joey,Dinner's on me.
114,Joey,"I'm sorry, Chandler."
115,Chandler,I hope she throws up on you.
116,Chandler,So...
117,Chandler,"Oh, what a crappy night!"
118,Chandler,Excuse me.
119,Chandler,How ya doin'?
120,Chandler,Joey's not a friend.
121,Chandler,He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card.
122,Chandler,Another drink?
123,Chandler,Some dessert?
124,Chandler,A big screen TV?
125,Chandler,You got it.

128,Chandler,"That's right, each."
129,Chandler,"Oh, and a uh Rob Roy."

137,Chandler,"Ok, well, this was very special."
138,Monica,"Rach, come see who's out here!"
139,Rachel,Oh my god.
140,Rachel,"Janice, hi!"
141,Chandler,Janice is gonna go away now.
142,Monica,I'll be right back.

146,Monica,"Oh, hi, Ross."
147,Monica,Yeah.
148,Monica,There's someone I want you to say hi to.
149,Monica,He just happened to call.
150,Ross,"I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half."
151,Ross,"The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend."
152,Ross,If you wanna put a label on it.
153,Ross,"Nope, nope, that's it."
154,Ross,"Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby."
155,Ross,I always forget that part.
156,Ross,Helloo!
157,Phoebe,"Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine."
158,Monica,"All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca."
159,Phoebe,"Um, that's ok!"
160,Phoebe,Ok. All right.
161,Phoebe,Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
162,Rachel,"Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place."
163,Monica,Can we just start throwing things in?
164,Phoebe,"Ok, yeah, ok.  Oh, OK."
165,Rachel,"Ok, Barry's letters."
166,Rachel,Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
167,Phoebe,"Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah."
168,Monica,"Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked."
169,Rachel,Hey he's wearing a sweater.
170,Monica,No.
171,Monica,Rachel and
172,Phoebe,Eww!
173,Rachel,And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
174,Monica,"Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure..."
175,Chandler,How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
176,Joey,I don't know.
177,Joey,You dumped her on New Year's.
178,Chandler,"Oh, man."
179,Chandler,"In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush."
180,Chandler,"Hi, Just Janice."
181,Joey,"If you don't do it, I will."
182,Ross,"So, um, what do you do for a living?"
183,Ross,Now that is funny.
184,Ross,"Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?"
185,Ross,"'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad."
186,Ross,Are you sure?
187,Ross,Great.
188,Ross,Carol?
189,Ross,Wanna come over and join us?
190,Ross,Come on.
191,Ross,These people'll scooch down.
192,Ross,"You guys'll scooch, won't you?"
193,Ross,Let's try scooching!
194,Ross,Come on.
195,Ross,Come on.
196,Ross,"Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick."
197,Ross,"Carol, Kristin."
198,Ross,"Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade."
199,Ross,"And, Kristin, Kristin......does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!"
200,Monica,"You know, it's a really funny story how this happened."
201,Monica,Fireman No.
202,Rachel,Really?
203,Rachel,Fireman No.
204,Chandler,Is it loaded?
205,Chandler,"Oh, little candy hearts."
206,Chandler,Chan and Jan Forever.
207,Chandler,"Ok, Janice."
208,Chandler,Janice.
209,Chandler,"Hey, Janice."
210,Chandler,"Look, there's no way for me to tell you this."
211,Chandler,At least there's no new way for me to tell you this.
212,Chandler,I just don't things are gonna work out.
213,Chandler,It is?
214,Chandler,"Oh no, you see, actually it is."
215,Chandler,"Oh, no I don't."
216,Chandler,"I did, but..."
217,Chandler,Call me!
218,Ross,You did so.
219,Ross,"I swear, I swear혰 How long has she been in the bathroom?"
220,Ross,Well maybe it's cold in there.
221,Ross,Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
222,Ross,"Oh, god."
223,Ross,"You know, this is still pretty hot."
224,Ross,"No, it's just...you know the whole ""getting on with your life"" thing."
225,Ross,"Well, do I have to?"
226,Ross,"I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it."
227,Ross,"And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought."
228,Ross,"Um, what's say you and I give it another shot?"
229,Ross,"No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian."
230,Ross,But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know?
231,Ross,"Let's just stick a pin in it, ok?"
232,Ross,"Because, we're great together, you know."
233,Ross,You can't deny it.
234,Ross,"Besides, you're carrying my baby."
235,Ross,"I mean, how perfect is that?"
236,Ross,"But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here."
237,Ross,I love you.
238,Ross,"No but, no but."
239,Ross,"That's easy for you to say, you found one already."
240,Rachel,"So, um, will you bring the truck?"
241,Rachel,Fireman No.
242,Rachel,"Oh, my god."
243,Phoebe,"See, there you go, the cleansing works!"
244,Monica,They're nice guys.
245,Rachel,"Oh, they're firemen guys."
