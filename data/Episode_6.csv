45,Joey,"Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!"
46,Chandler,"Well, yeah actually."
47,Monica,We'll try to be more careful okay?
48,Monica,"It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret."
49,Chandler,"I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships."
50,Monica,We are!
51,Monica,Help us!
52,Chandler,Help!

101,Chandler,Okay?
102,Joey,I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
103,Phoebe,"Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food?"
104,Phoebe,You gotta scare people off.
105,Phoebe,I learned that living on the street.
106,Ross,Really?!
107,Ross,So what would you say Pheebs?
108,Ross,"Stuff like uh, ""Keep your mitts off my grub?"""
109,Chandler,"Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?"
110,Phoebe,"Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff."
111,Monica,"Phoebe, you are a bad ass!"

119,Rachel,"Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anywayumm, what is this book about?"
120,Phoebe,"Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England."
121,Phoebe,Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
122,Phoebe,I totally get symbolism.
123,Phoebe,The
124,Rachel,"Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story."
125,Rachel,The
126,Rachel,"Oh-oh-oh, symbolism!"
127,Rachel,"And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character."
128,Rachel,The
129,Phoebe,You completely stole my answer!
130,Rachel,"Well, honey that was pretty obvious."
131,Phoebe,Well how would you know?!
132,Phoebe,You didn't even read it!
133,Phoebe,The
134,Phoebe,"I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers."
135,Phoebe,The

137,Phoebe,The
138,Phoebe,Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
139,Phoebe,The
140,Phoebe,Okay then.
141,Phoebe,Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?
142,Rachel,Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid!
143,Rachel,"I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!"
144,Ross,Phoebe!
145,Phoebe,Yeah?
146,Ross,Phoebe!
147,Ross,"You're note, amazing!"
148,Ross,"Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me."
149,Ross,"Yeah, a guy called me mental!"
150,Ross,"Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that."
151,Monica,"Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller."
152,Ross,That was the water fountain!
153,Ross,Okay?!
154,Ross,"Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want."
155,Ross,"Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee!"
156,Ross,Now!
157,Joey,"So you uh, still wondering?"

174,Monica,We're so sorry.
175,Chandler,Yeah.
176,Joey,"Well, I'm telling everyone about you!"
177,Joey,That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
178,Chandler,"No-no, wait!"
179,Chandler,There's got to be a better explanation.
180,Chandler,You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your  adult film class.
181,Joey,"Yeah, I like that."
182,Joey,"But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?"
183,Chandler,OhI don't know.
184,Joey,"Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!"
185,Monica,"Okay, just wait, please."

206,Ross,What?
207,Ross,Dr.
208,Ross,You ate my sandwich?
209,Ross,Dr.

228,Rachel,Vogue!
229,Rachel,"Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman."
230,Phoebe,No!
231,Phoebe,You should've read it yourself!
232,Rachel,Come on Phoebe!
233,Rachel,Don't be such a goodie-goodie!
234,Phoebe,Fine!
235,Phoebe,"Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not."
236,Phoebe,She's a cyborg.
237,Rachel,A cyborg?!
238,Rachel,Isn't that like a robot?
239,Phoebe,"Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time."
240,Phoebe,The
241,Phoebe,"Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights."
242,Phoebe,The
243,Rachel,"Uh, thank you Phoebe."
244,Rachel,"Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time."
245,Rachel,The
246,Rachel,"Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots."
247,Chandler,Hey.
248,Monica,Hey.
249,Monica,"Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview."

256,Ross,I'm fine!
257,Ross,I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
258,Monica,Why?
259,Ross,On account of my rage.
260,Chandler,"Which I may say, right now, is out of control."
261,Ross,He gave me a pill for it.
262,Monica,A pill?
263,Ross,Uh-huh.
264,Ross,"Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer."
265,Ross,"And I thought was a good idea so, I took it."
266,Monica,"Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?"
267,Chandler,And you're okay with that?
268,Ross,I don't know.
269,Ross,"It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich."
270,Rachel,"Ugh, that was so embarrassing!"
271,Rachel,I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!
272,Phoebe,I'm sorry.
273,Phoebe,It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
274,Rachel,That was not funny!
275,Phoebe,"Well, I snapped!"
276,Phoebe,Okay?
277,Phoebe,You weren't taking the class seriously.
278,Rachel,"Phoebe, come on!"
279,Rachel,What is the big deal?
280,Rachel,I thought this was going to be something we could do together!
281,Rachel,"Y'know, I thought it would be fun!"
282,Phoebe,"Well, yeah!"
283,Phoebe,"Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn."
284,Phoebe,"Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school."
285,Rachel,Ohh.
286,Rachel,"Oh, so you really wanted to learn."
287,Rachel,"Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun."

315,Phoebe,Everybody just calm down.
316,Phoebe,Okay?
317,Phoebe,Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
318,Joey,No!
319,Joey,I am not a pervert!
320,Joey,Okay?
321,Joey,It's just I just Kinda
322,Chandler,"All right, look!"
323,Chandler,Look.
324,Chandler,I think I can explain this.
325,Joey,Thank you!
326,Chandler,Joey's a sex addict.
327,Joey,What?!!
328,Joey,No I'm not!
329,Monica,It's okay!
330,Monica,It's good!
331,Monica,It's good.
332,Monica,It's a disease!
333,Joey,No!
334,Joey,No!
335,Joey,I am not a sex addict!
336,Monica,Yes you are!
337,Monica,That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
338,Joey,No it isn't!
339,Joey,"No, it's not."
340,Joey,Because you can also explain it with the truth!
341,Rachel,"Well, what is the truth?"
342,Ross,"Yeah, what's going on?"
343,Phoebe,What's going on?
344,Joey,I slept with Monica.
345,Chandler,Well let's.let's see what everybody thinks of that?
346,Monica,Oh no!
347,Ross,You slept with my sister?
348,Joey,"Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London."
349,Ross,This is not good for my rage.
350,Rachel,"Monica, is this true?"
351,Joey,Of course it's true!
352,Joey,How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
353,Monica,Yes it's true.
354,Rachel,"Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?"
355,Joey,Ahhoy!
356,Joey,That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London.
357,Joey,Right Monica?
358,Monica,I guess I wanted to keep it  as a souvenir.
359,Ross,My God Monica!
360,Chandler,Are you sure Joe?
361,Chandler,Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
362,Joey,No!
363,Joey,"If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica!"
364,Joey,Yeah.
365,Joey,Yeah.
366,Joey,She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
367,Phoebe,So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
368,Joey,That makes sense!
369,Rachel,And the video camera?
370,Joey,"Uhh, Monica?"
371,Monica,I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
372,Joey,But sadly I could not be enticed.
373,Ross,Unbelievable!
374,Ross,I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?!
375,Ross,Why?
376,Ross,Why would you do that?
377,Monica,I'm Monica.
378,Monica,I'm disgusting.
379,Monica,I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
380,Joey,"Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not."
381,Joey,Eh?
382,Joey,"All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket."
383,Joey,"I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs."
