201,Joey,"But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it."
202,Ross,Well you shouldn't be.

228,Ross,Okay?
229,Ross,"Hey-hey, we'll each go out with her one more time."
230,Ross,And-and we'll see who she likes best.
231,Joey,That sounds fair.
232,Ross,Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street
233,Joey,Ah yeahwait a second now!
234,Joey,Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.
235,Joey,I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
236,Ross,"Well sorry, that's what I do on dates."
237,Joey,"All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates."
238,Ross,So let's decide on the spending limit
239,Joey,Yeah.
240,Joey,"Uh, a slicesix dollars?"
241,Ross,I was thinking more like a hundred.
242,Joey,Okay.
243,Joey,Can I borrow 94 dollars?
244,Monica,Oh
245,Phoebe,I know.

287,Joey,You're screwed!
288,Ross,"Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date."
289,Ross,"So techincally, technically I didn't break any rules."
290,Ross,Thanks for stopping by though.

312,Chandler,What are you guys talking about?
313,Monica,"Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go."
314,Rachel,"Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced."
315,Rachel,"And now I'm not saying that there's any connection here y'know, but they did tell me that's why they got divorced."
316,Chandler,But I love swing music!
317,Phoebe,Yeah but the Swing Kings?
318,Phoebe,Y'know they suck so much that people actually die at their concertsThey just stop living.
319,Chandler,"Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun!"
320,Chandler,And there's another reason too.
321,Rachel,"Well, what is the other reason?"
322,Chandler,I don't want to say.
323,Rachel,Well you have to because maybe it's stupid.
324,Chandler,Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it wasthe first time I knew thatyou were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
325,Monica,Oh crap!
326,Ross,So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
327,Ross,Yeah.
328,Ross,Oh yeah it's fine.
329,Ross,I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.
330,Joey,Kristen?
331,Joey,Hi!
332,Joey,Oh I like this place.
333,Joey,"And technically, technically I'm not breaking any rules so I"
334,Joey,Hi!
335,Ross,Hi.
336,Ross,It's nice to meet you.
337,Ross,I used to have a friend named Joey.
338,Ross,I don't anymore.
339,Ross,Yeah.
340,Ross,So
341,Joey,Sure!
342,Joey,I would love to wait with you guys!
343,Joey,Thanks!
344,Ross,"So Joey umm, you look familiar."
345,Ross,"Are uh, are you on TV or something?"
346,Ross,That's right!
347,Ross,"That's right, don't you play a woman?"
348,Joey,A woman in a man's body.
349,Ross,Much better.
350,Joey,"So y'know Ross it's funny cause, you look familiar to me too."
351,Joey,Have you ever been married?
352,Ross,"Well yes, yes I have."
353,Ross,"In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I've been married and how I have a son."
354,Ross,That's right!
355,Ross,"Wait no, Ben."
356,Joey,So you've just married the one time then?
357,Ross,Well umm
358,Ross,Yes.
359,Ross,And another time after that.
360,Ross,Boy I'm getting hungry!
361,Ross,"Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?"
362,Joey,Yeah.
363,Joey,"So uh Ross, well nowwhy did that first marriage breakup?"
364,Joey,Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?
365,Ross,No.
366,Ross,No.
367,Joey,No.
368,Joey,It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
369,Ross,Wait a minute!
370,Ross,Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
371,Joey,Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?
372,Ross,Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
373,Joey,Fine!
374,Joey,Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?
375,Ross,Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?
376,Joey,Monkey lover!
377,Joey,When do you think we lost her?
378,Ross,Probably around gonorrhea.
379,Chandler,"Hi, honey!"
380,Chandler,I'm home!
381,Monica,Don't come in here!
382,Chandler,Why?
383,Chandler,Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
384,Monica,No!
385,Monica,We only mess around at his place!
386,Chandler,"Y'know it's funny I started it but, now it's scary me."
387,Chandler,So could you come out here please?
388,Monica,"No, I'm wearing a wedding dress."
389,Chandler,Oh you got a wedding dress?
390,Chandler,That's great!
391,Monica,Yeah but I'm not keeping it.

396,Chandler,Okay I promise.
397,Chandler,I'll-I'll hate it.
398,Chandler,Wow!
399,Chandler,You-you lookhideous.
400,Monica,Really?
401,Chandler,"Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen."
402,Chandler,Wh-why do you to return it?
403,Monica,Oh because it doesn'treally fit.
404,Monica,"Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings."
405,Chandler,Oh that's great!
406,Chandler,Great!
