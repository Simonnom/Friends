48,Monica,Wow!
49,Monica,"She is pretty, huh?"
50,Joey,"Tell me about it, huh?"

59,Joey,"But I counted, you're not supposed to live here!"
60,Joey,Oh man!
61,Joey,Ugh!

63,Joey,I ended up at Ross's place.
64,Joey,"Oh, I musta missed counted or something."
65,Joey,Damn!
66,Joey,She's not there anymore.
67,Joey,"Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit."
68,Monica,"No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV."
69,Phoebe,But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk.
70,Phoebe,"Okay, then maybe I can come too!"
71,Phoebe,Gary's
72,Phoebe,"All right, you go."

79,Phoebe,"Yeah, it's weird."
80,Phoebe,"I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this little puppy dog, y'know?"
81,Phoebe,But like a really tough one that shots bad guys.
82,Phoebe,"Ohh, I just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?!"
83,Phoebe,You just like can't keep your hands off each other.
84,Monica,I know it is the best.
85,Phoebe,So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
86,Monica,What?
87,Monica,It's still going on.
88,Phoebe,"Come on, seriously!"
89,Phoebe,When did it end?
90,Monica,"I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time."
91,Phoebe,"Okay, you know where you are better than I do."
92,Phoebe,I was just curious.
93,Monica,What don't you just calm down Phoebe!
94,Monica,All right?!
95,Monica,Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!
96,Phoebe,"God, I woke the beast."
97,Phoebe,Sorry.
98,Phoebe,"I was wrong obviously, I justI misspoke."
99,Phoebe,It's okay.
100,Monica,"Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you!"
101,Monica,"I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!"
102,Chandler,"Hey Monica, here's your broom back."
103,Monica,You are so cute.
104,Chandler,"Oh hey, how'd the interview go?"
105,Rachel,"Ugh, horrible!"
106,Rachel,"I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!"
107,Joey,Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?
108,Rachel,No!
109,Chandler,So what happened?
110,Rachel,"Ugh, it was horrible!"
111,Rachel,"And-and the interview part went so well, y'know?"
112,Rachel,I even made him laugh.
113,Rachel,"He said something about a boat and I was like, ""Well, yeah!"
114,Rachel,"If you've got enough life jackets!"""
115,Rachel,"Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny."
116,Rachel,"Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!"
117,Joey,What happened?
118,Rachel,"All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh"
119,Joey,You kissed him?
120,Rachel,"Well, I didn't know what else to do!"
121,Chandler,"Well you coulda tried, not kissing him."
122,Rachel,Thanks Chandler.

124,Rachel,I can't believe it!
125,Rachel,I got a second interview!
126,Monica,Yes!
127,Joey,"I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?"
128,Rachel,"What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?"
129,Joey,Yeah!
130,Joey,No?
131,Monica,A kiss?
132,Monica,What are you talking about?
133,Rachel,"I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause ""Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"""
134,Chandler,"Come on, Rach."
135,Rachel,Oh my God!
136,Rachel,What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
137,Monica,He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
138,Rachel,Maybe.
139,Rachel,"I-I don't knowOh God, how could I be so stupid?"
140,Joey,"Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey."
141,Joey,Come on.
142,Joey,Come on.

181,Rachel,"Now even though I , hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me."
182,Rachel,"I do not want, this job that bad."

258,Joey,But y'know what?
259,Joey,"Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway."
260,Monica,Why?

284,Rachel,"Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you."
285,Rachel,Mr.
286,Rachel,"Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah,  who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why."
287,Rachel,"I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage."
288,Rachel,"When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no."
289,Rachel,That shows integrity.
290,Rachel,"And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage."
291,Rachel,"Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage."
292,Rachel,"And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious."
293,Rachel,"{By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against."
294,Rachel,So she didn't want to sue him.
295,Rachel,"Don't worry, I had to look it up too.}"
296,Rachel,"So there you go, you got, you got  courage, you got integrity, you got  courage again, and not litigious."
297,Rachel,Look Mr Mr.
298,Rachel,Zelner!
299,Rachel,Right!

305,Rachel,Mr.
306,Rachel,Really?
307,Rachel,Oh thank you!
308,Rachel,"Oh Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?"
309,Rachel,Mr.
310,Rachel,"Okay, well then how about a handshake?"
311,Rachel,Oh God I'm sorry!
312,Rachel,"Oh God, I'm sorry!"
313,Rachel,I did not mean to touch thatI mean you there.

318,Monica,"You better believe he's tired, after the day we had!"
319,Monica,If you know what I mean.
320,Monica,You know what I mean?
321,Chandler,"Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean."
322,Chandler,"Oh yeah, it's so cool."
323,Chandler,"Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100."
324,Chandler,That's pee-pee.
325,Monica,"Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair."
326,Phoebe,"Ohh,  umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here."
327,Monica,You didn't!
328,Phoebe,We did!
329,Phoebe,We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!
330,Monica,The park huh?
331,Monica,A public place.
332,Monica,I hear ya.
333,Monica,Excuse me for just a second!
334,Monica,Hi Chandler.
335,Chandler,Monica!
336,Chandler,This is the Men's room!
337,Chandler,Isn't it?
338,Monica,Yes it is.
339,Monica,You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual.
340,Monica,Haven't you?
341,Chandler,No.
342,Chandler,"And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out."
343,Chandler,"Monica, this is getting ridiculous!"
344,Monica,"Come on, we can't let them win!"
345,Chandler,"Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot!"
346,Chandler,Okay?
347,Chandler,So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?
348,Monica,Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
349,Chandler,So?
350,Monica,I feel really sad that we're notreally there anymore.
351,Chandler,Oh wow!
352,Chandler,Is that what this all have been about?
353,Monica,Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
354,Chandler,Yeah that was great.
355,Chandler,That was really great!
356,Chandler,"But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now."
357,Monica,Really?
358,Chandler,Yeah!
359,Chandler,I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before.
360,Chandler,"Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible."
361,Chandler,"And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting."
362,Monica,That is so sweet.
363,Monica,"I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way."
364,Chandler,Yeah?
365,Monica,Yeah.
366,Chandler,Y'know what I just realized?
367,Chandler,You just freaked out about our relationship.
368,Monica,Did not.
369,Chandler,Yes you did!
370,Chandler,Admit it!
371,Chandler,You freaked out!
372,Monica,"Okay, I freaked out a little."
373,Chandler,Little?!
374,Chandler,You freaked out big time!
375,Chandler,Okay?
376,Chandler,And I fixed it!
377,Chandler,We have switched places!
378,Chandler,"I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up!"
379,Chandler,And now we're back.
380,Chandler,Ending Credits
