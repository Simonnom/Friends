111,Ross,She doesn't know what to say!
112,Chandler,Just give us the cheapest room you have.
113,Chandler,That's insane!
114,Ross,Totally insane.
115,Ross,"Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves."
116,Chandler,Does that room have a closet I can lock him in?
117,Chandler,We'll take it.
118,Chandler,What!?
119,Chandler,They are totally ripping us off!
120,Ross,"Dude, don't worry 'bout it!"

154,Ross,"Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206."
155,Ross,It seems you forgot a couple of things.
156,Ross,Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room?
157,Ross,Thank you!
158,Ross,"Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already?"

160,Ross,Ross
161,Chandler,USA Today
162,Ross,"Nice, put it with the others."
163,Chandler,And I also got... two more apples.
164,Ross,We are four short of a bush-o .
165,Ross,"God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!"
166,Chandler,I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
167,Ross,"Oh, that's not cool."
168,Chandler,"Dude, none of this is cool."
169,Ross,"No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you."
170,Ross,For
171,Chandler,"I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that."
172,Ross,"Not my first time in a hotel, my friend."
173,Chandler,"Ok, how about this ?"
174,Ross,"No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!"
175,Chandler,"Yes, but the batteries... Chandler"
176,Ross,Let's celebrate with some maple candy!
177,Chandler,No!
178,Ross,At least tell me where you hid it.
179,Rachel,Can I ask you a question?
180,Monica,Yeah.
181,Rachel,Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
182,Monica,Let me think.
183,Monica,"Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head."
184,Rachel,"Ok, well this is like that...in no way."
185,Rachel,I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.
186,Monica,"Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?"
187,Rachel,Oh yeah!
188,Rachel,"I mean, that was pretty intense."
189,Monica,What do you think brought than on?
190,Rachel,I don't know!
191,Rachel,"I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday."
192,Monica,A love scene?
193,Monica,With who?
194,Rachel,Olivia.
195,Monica,Olivia?
196,Monica,I thought she was marrying Connor!
197,Monica,"Oh right, real life more important."
198,Rachel,So do you think that my dream means anything?
199,Monica,I don't know.
200,Monica,"I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake."
201,Rachel,Ah!
202,Rachel,Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...
203,Monica,Of course it was!
204,Monica,"Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about."
205,Monica,I took two psych classes in college.
206,Rachel,You took the same class twice.
207,Monica,It was hard!
208,Monica,Phoebe
209,Monica,Hi.
210,Phoebe,"Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant  uh, huh wait!"
211,Phoebe,Right?
212,Phoebe,"I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man."
213,Monica,Oh...Phoebe?
214,Monica,Maybe I wasn't clear before.
215,Monica,"I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place."
216,Phoebe,"Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault."
217,Monica,"Phoebe, it's not what you wear."
218,Monica,It's sort of your songs...
219,Monica,I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.
220,Phoebe,"Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back ."
221,Phoebe,Rachel
222,Phoebe,My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?
223,Rachel,"Ok, we're still on that."
224,Monica,I didn't say your songs were not good enough.
225,Phoebe,Then what's wrong with them?
226,Phoebe,Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?
227,Monica,Tiny portions?
228,Phoebe,"Yeah well, ""excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but  I can't see it, I can't see it""!"
229,Monica,"Phoebe, it's not about quantity."
230,Phoebe,Well...it's not about quality.
231,Monica,"Oh really, you want to talk about quality?"
232,Monica,Have you heard of a key?
233,Monica,It's what some people sing in.
234,Phoebe,Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic.
235,Phoebe,"Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica."
236,Monica,"Ok, so that's what we're doing."
237,Monica,"You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs."
238,Phoebe,"Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?"
239,Monica,You know what?
240,Monica,I take back what I said before.
241,Monica,"You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy."
242,Phoebe,"What are people having, the garlic Martini?"
243,Chandler,"Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps."
244,Chandler,Chandler
245,Ross,"Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car."
246,Ross,We're way ahead of the game.
247,Ross,Ross
248,Chandler,What?
249,Ross,There's something new in the bowl.
250,Chandler,"Look, we have enough, just walk away."
251,Ross,"No, but I want...I want the pinecones!"
252,Chandler,There's a forest right outside.
253,Ross,It's not the same.
254,Chandler,"Ok, go quick!"
255,Chandler,Ross
256,Phoebe,Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you.. Monica
257,Phoebe,"You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself."
258,Monica,"Ok, you have to stop playing now."
259,Phoebe,Why?
260,Phoebe,The only person my playing is bothering is you!
261,Monica,Oh yeah?
262,Monica,"Ok, let's settle this, come on!"
263,Phoebe,Get your garlic-peelers off me!
264,Monica,"Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. .. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever!"
265,Monica,"Ok, quick"
266,Phoebe,"Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside?"
267,Phoebe,Ha!
268,Monica,"Alright, let me ask you this"
269,Phoebe,"Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?"
270,Monica,Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone?
271,Phoebe,"Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking?"
272,Monica,Excuse us!
273,Monica,Alright here's a
274,Phoebe,Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great!
275,Monica,I'm sorry...
276,Phoebe,I'm sorry too...
277,Monica,ooohh... hey!
278,Monica,Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?
279,Phoebe,Yeah!
280,Phoebe,As long as it's free!
281,Phoebe,Food here is ridiculously over-p...  Phoebe
282,Rachel,Hey!
283,Joey,Hey!
284,Rachel,"Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?"
285,Joey,Oh man!
286,Joey,I thought I got it all!
287,Rachel,How...how...?
288,Joey,"I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?"
289,Rachel,uh-huh
290,Joey,"And I couldn't find this little plastic thing  that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...?"
291,Joey,Turns out very!
292,Rachel,Wow...definitely just Drake...
293,Joey,What?
294,Rachel,What...how is it going with Drake?
295,Joey,Oh...I don't think it's going very well...
296,Rachel,What...that scene I saw was so good!
297,Joey,"Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow..."
298,Rachel,"Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?"
299,Joey,A little.
300,Joey,"Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia."
301,Rachel,So?
302,Joey,So...I've never played that!
303,Rachel,Ooh!
304,Rachel,"Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?"
305,Joey,Uh...well...just once...with you...
306,Rachel,Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?
307,Joey,What the hell are you talking about?
308,Rachel,"Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how  you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene."
309,Joey,Oh!
310,Joey,"ok, yeah, I think I can do that."
311,Joey,"Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me."
312,Rachel,"Joey, you never..you never talked about that before..."
313,Joey,"Well.. hey, you know what else I could use?"
314,Joey,"There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us!"
315,Joey,"And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know?"
316,Joey,"And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful...  and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you  but it was worth it just to be there looking at you."
317,Joey,Joey
318,Chandler,I got you something from Vermont!
319,Monica,Besides tampons and salt?
320,Monica,Ooh!
321,Monica,My God!
322,Monica,Maple candy!
323,Monica,That's so sweet of you.
324,Monica,That's weird...it's empty!
325,Monica,Ross
