21,Joey,"Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her."
22,Chandler,"Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship."
23,Chandler,"Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth."
24,Ross,Hey.
25,Joey,"Whoa, dude, look out!"
26,Joey,You almost crushed my hat!

31,Joey,"Yeah, look there's this play all right?"
32,Joey,And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy.
33,Joey,A real clothes horse.
34,Joey,"So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff."
35,Chandler,And you're gonna make them all disappear.
36,Joey,"Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this."
37,Chandler,Done.
38,Rachel,"Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store?"
39,Rachel,I'll help you out.
40,Joey,Great!
41,Joey,"Thanks, Rach!"

56,Joey,Sorry!
57,Phoebe,"It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life."
58,Phoebe,"And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit."

60,Phoebe,"Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!"
61,Monica,Guys!
62,Monica,Guys!
63,Monica,I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.
64,Ross,"Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died."
65,Monica,"Ohh my God, I'm so sorry."
66,Phoebe,It's okay.
67,Phoebe,"Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool."
68,Phoebe,"'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins."
69,Monica,Not the way they're doing it.
70,Monica,"What, what happened?"
71,Monica,How did she die?
72,Phoebe,"Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again."
73,Joey,"Pheebs, I'm so sorry."
74,Phoebe,It was really sweet.
75,Phoebe,"The last thing she said to me was; ""Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter."""
76,Phoebe,And y'know what?
77,Phoebe,We will meet at the checkout counter.
78,Rachel,"Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?"
79,Joey,"All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then."
80,Rachel,"Okay, it's missing something."
81,Rachel,"Ooh, I know!"
82,Rachel,"Umm, okay."
83,Joey,Really?
84,Joey,A purse?
85,Rachel,It's not a purse!
86,Rachel,It's a shoulder bag.
87,Joey,It looks like a women's purse.
88,Rachel,"No Joey, look."
89,Rachel,"Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog."
90,Rachel,Look.
91,Rachel,"See look, men, carrying the bag."

104,Phoebe,"Umm, well, umm Grandma died."
105,Phoebe,"No, she just died today!"
106,Phoebe,"Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow."
107,Phoebe,No you didn't!

128,Rachel,"Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it."
129,Joey,Why would I return it?
130,Joey,I love this bag!
131,Rachel,"All right, then you owe me $350."
132,Joey,Fine!
133,Joey,Do you take Vasa or Mustercard?

147,Phoebe,My Grandma had the exact same bag!
148,Joey,"Here, I brought you some flowers."
149,Phoebe,Thanks!
150,Chandler,Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
151,Phoebe,"Yeah, welcome."

174,Phoebe,"Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?"
175,Rachel,Why?!
176,Rachel,Why not?
177,Phoebe,"Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here!"
178,Phoebe,What do you think?

293,Monica,I'm crying here!
294,Chandler,"Okay, hear me out."
295,Chandler,Okay?
296,Chandler,You give the best bad massages.
297,Chandler,"If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, ""Who's the best of that?"""
298,Chandler,They'd have to go to you.
299,Monica,Huh.
