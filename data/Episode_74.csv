11,Joey,A year?
12,Rachel,Do you have to go?
13,Monica,I kind of have to don't I?
14,Monica,Because of this stupid   thing
15,Chandler,"There is nothing like the support of your loving   wife, huh?"
16,Joey,"Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa."
17,Joey,"Maybe you forgot,   but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week."
18,Chandler,"I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be   able to make it."
19,Joey,We were gonna go see the Jets!
20,Ross,"You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this   group together!"
21,Chandler,Really?
22,Ross,Not you.
23,Joey,I can't believe you guys are moving.
24,Phoebe,I call their apartment!!
25,Joey,Here you are
26,Rachel,Thank you Joey.
27,Rachel,You know what?
28,Rachel,I'm not even sure   I can have caffeine.
29,Ross,I went thru this with Ben and Carol.
30,Ross,One cup of coffee   won't affect your milk.
31,Rachel,Yeah.
32,Rachel,Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.
33,Rachel,Every time?
34,Joey,Uhuh.
35,Ross,"Rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little   question, okay?"
36,Ross,"Trust me, I know this."
37,Rachel,"All right, I trust you."
38,Ross,"Rachel, I can see you dialing!"
39,Ross,I don't understand why...
40,Rachel,I'm on the phone!
41,Rachel,Dr. Wiener?
42,Phoebe,It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby.
43,Phoebe,It's just so grown up.
44,Joey,"I know, yeah."
45,Joey,I feel like we're all growing up.
46,Joey,"Person   named Wiener, God that kills me."
47,Phoebe,Look at you all grown up.
48,Joey,"Actually, you know what?"
49,Joey,I am.
50,Joey,That whole thing with   Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship.
51,Joey,You know?
52,Joey,Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady.
53,Joey,"And looks   aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot."
54,Phoebe,"You know, I might know somebody."
55,Phoebe,"Hey, how about you   set me up with someone, and we double date!"
56,Joey,"I can do that, yeah."
57,Joey,How is Friday?
58,Phoebe,Done.
59,Phoebe,"Oh good, really?"
60,Joey,Yeah!

66,Joey,[SCENE
67,Chandler,Hey!
68,Monica,Hey!
69,Chandler,I've got good news!
70,Monica,You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?
71,Chandler,"Okay, I have news."
72,Chandler,You don't have to move to Tulsa.
73,Chandler,You can stay here and keep your job.
74,Monica,It's great!
75,Monica,How?
76,Monica,Chandler.
77,Monica,"Well my boss and I worked out a deal where I only   have to be in Tulsa four days a week, so the other three I can be here with   you."
78,Monica,So you're gonna be gone four days a week?
79,Monica,No.
80,Chandler,"I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?"
81,Monica,No.
82,Monica,I can't be away from you for that long.
83,Chandler,Really?
84,Monica,"Yeah, you're my husband."
85,Monica,I'm not gonna live in a   different state than you for 208 days out of the year.
86,Chandler,That's fast math!
87,Chandler,We could use you in Tulsa.
88,Monica,"Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but   if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you."
89,Chandler,"Hey, you said that without gagging!"
90,Monica,I know!
91,Rachel,Excuse me?
92,Rachel,Oh yeah?
93,Rachel,"Well, up yours too!"
94,Ross,Who the hell was that?
95,Rachel,Dr. Wiener.
96,Ross,"Rach, you can't call people at three in the morning."
97,Rachel,"Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!"
98,Ross,Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?
99,Rachel,"Yes, of course there is!"
100,Rachel,Okay?
101,Rachel,I'm not insane!
102,Ross,"Well, what was it?"
103,Rachel,Hiccups.
104,Ross,"Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any   little thing comes up."
105,Rachel,"Yeah well, not anymore I can't."
106,Rachel,He fired us!
107,Rachel,What   are we gonna do?
108,Rachel,We have to find a pediatrician.
109,Rachel,"Wait wait, Monica said that   when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor."
110,Rachel,What was his name?
111,Ross,Dr. Gettleman?
112,Ross,"Yeah I know, I don't think that's a   good idea."
113,Ross,"In fact, I think he's dead."
114,Rachel,Argh!
115,Rachel,Why does everything happen to me?
116,Ross,"Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another   doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well."
117,Rachel,What?
118,Rachel,"What, do you mean you're not feeling well?"
119,Rachel,What do you have?
120,Rachel,Is it Rubella?
121,Rachel,"Because don't go near Emma, she has not had   that shot."
122,Ross,You know?
123,Ross,"Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like!"
124,Rachel,"Wiener, Wiener  Wiener, Wiener!!"
125,Ross,Rachel!!
126,Rachel,Great!
127,Rachel,Now he's gonna know it was me!
128,Phoebe,Hey!
129,Joey,Hey!
130,Phoebe,So how is this for our big double date tonight?
131,Joey,Oh my God!
132,Phoebe,"Ooh, great!"
133,Phoebe,Just the reaction I was hoping for.
134,Joey,"Yeah, so you found someone for me."
135,Joey,You didn't forget?
136,Phoebe,Of course not!
137,Phoebe,And you're gonna love Mary Ellen.
138,Phoebe,"She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this,   but she' not opposed to threesomes."
139,Phoebe,So tell me some about my guy.
140,Joey,No.
141,Phoebe,"Come on, give me something."
142,Phoebe,What's his name?
143,Joey,Mike.
144,Phoebe,Mike?
145,Phoebe,Okay!
146,Phoebe,What's his last name?
147,Joey,Damnit!
148,Joey,Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!
149,Phoebe,"All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant   in a couple hours."
150,Phoebe,Joey and
151,Joey,Why did I have to say Mike?
152,Joey,I don't know a Mike!
153,Joey,Why   couldn't I have said...
154,Joey,There's no guy in   there!
155,Rachel,It's impossible to find a good doctor.
156,Rachel,"I mean, how   do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against   your knee?"
157,Monica,Excuse me?
158,Chandler,I know what she's talking about.
159,Rachel,We've got to find a new pediatrician.
160,Rachel,"Ross was getting   sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it."
161,Monica,Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?
162,Rachel,Ross said he died.
163,Monica,He didn't die.
164,Monica,I saw his daughter last week.
165,Monica,Said   he was fine.
166,Monica,"Her on the other hand, botched Botox."
167,Rachel,"Oh, great!"
168,Rachel,"Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see   him."
169,Rachel,I wonder why Ross said that he died.
170,Monica,"Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood   therapist."
171,Chandler,He saw a therapist?
172,Monica,"Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just   really freaked him out."
173,Rachel,Why?
174,Rachel,What was it?
175,Monica,That I was going to eat him.
176,Joey,MIKE!!
177,Joey,Okay!
178,Joey,Everything is gonna be fine.
179,Joey,"Just follow my lead, okay?"
180,Joey,All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.
181,Joey,Atta boy!
182,Joey,"Okay, look..."
183,Phoebe,"Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins."
184,Phoebe,"So, Mike, how do   you and Joey know each other anyway?"
185,Joey,From school.
186,Phoebe,"Wow, you guys go way back then."
187,Phoebe,So what are you up   to these days?
188,Joey,"Mike, 'attorney at law'!"
189,Joey,What?
190,Joey,That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.
191,Phoebe,"Wow, that's great!"
192,Phoebe,"I liked that better than the law   thing, so..."
193,Joey,Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to   Mike.
194,Joey,Mary
195,Joey,"No, no, that's not what I meant."
196,Joey,Let's get you a cocktail.
197,Monica,Hey!
198,Chandler,Hey!
199,Monica,What are you doing?
200,Chandler,Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
201,Monica,That's so sweet.
202,Monica,Find anything?
203,Chandler,Slim Pickings.
204,Monica,"Nothing, huh?"
205,Chandler,"No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant."
206,Chandler,They're looking for a cook.
207,Chandler,Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch.
208,Chandler,They're   looking for someone to shovel mesquite.
209,Monica,'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.
210,Chandler,'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
211,Monica,"Honey, that's okay."
212,Monica,"I actually know this woman, Nancy,   who's a restaurant biz head-hunter."
213,Monica,Maybe she'll know of something.
214,Chandler,Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming   with me.
215,Chandler,When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'.
216,Chandler,'So Cheesy'?
217,Chandler,'Whole Hog'?
218,Chandler,It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.
219,Monica,"Hi, Nancy."
220,Monica,"Hi, it's Monica Geller."
221,Monica,I'm   good.
222,Monica,"Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa."
223,Monica,"Well yeah, my husband has been   relocated...Because I love him!"
224,Monica,"No, I don't want a job in New York."
225,Monica,Javo    is looking?
226,Monica,Oh my God!
227,Monica,He asked for me personally?
228,Monica,Oh my God!
229,Monica,"Oh, wow, this   is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa."
230,Monica,"Yeah, so if you would tell Javo    'I'll take it!'"
231,Rachel,"Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment   for Emma."
232,Ross,Thanks doctor.
233,Ross,Dr.
234,Ross,You even have to ask?!
235,Ross,He is alive!
236,Phoebe,"You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have   known each other for so long and I've never heard about you."
237,Joey,"Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out."
238,Joey,Mike hit my mom with a car.
239,Joey,"That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you."
240,Joey,And now we're   friends again everything's great!
241,Joey,"Mary Ellen Wait, is your mom okay?"
242,Joey,"Please, we're trying to have a conversation."
243,Joey,Mary
244,Phoebe,What?
245,Joey,What?
246,Phoebe,Do you not know each other?
247,Joey,Of course we do!
248,Joey,Mike is playing a game that   we used to play in high school.
249,Joey,"Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other."
250,Joey,We played all kinds of games.
251,Joey,"Hey, remember the one where I punch   you in the face for not being cool?"
252,Phoebe,"Mike, let me ask you something."
253,Phoebe,How many sisters   does Joey have?
254,Joey,What are you doing?
255,Joey,I said seven!
256,Joey,Argh!!
257,Phoebe,"Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?"
258,Joey,"Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry."
259,Phoebe,You are unbelievable!
260,Phoebe,"I spent so much time   finding the perfect girl for you, you know."
261,Phoebe,Mary Ellen is really smart and   cute and loose.
262,Phoebe,Mary
263,Phoebe,Who are you kidding?
264,Phoebe,You just find some   guy off the street for me?
265,Phoebe,Oh God!
266,Phoebe,This is humiliating!
267,Joey,Look Phoebe I'm so sorry!
268,Joey,"Hey, look, if you don't like   this guy I can find you a better one."
269,Joey,Mike!!
270,Joey,Mike!
271,Phoebe,I'm out of here
272,Joey,You're leaving too?
273,Joey,Mary
274,Joey,Good night!
275,Chandler,"Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got   a lot of packing to do."
276,Monica,You're right.
277,Monica,Maybe I shouldn't go.
278,Chandler,What?
279,Monica,"So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant,   Javo ."
280,Monica,It's just a little outside of Tulsa.
281,Chandler,How far outside?
282,Monica,Manhattan.
283,Chandler,And you're thinking of taking it?
284,Chandler,"So before   you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now   it's old job,  me,  new job."
285,Monica,I'm gonna miss this hand!
286,Monica,"Okay I know it's a lot   to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity."
287,Chandler,What happened to 'you can't live without me four   days a week'?
288,Monica,"Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days   is not that long."
289,Monica,"I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see   you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really   if you think about it, it's really just one day."
290,Monica,"And well, if we can't make   it one day, we've got real problems my friend."
291,Chandler,I think you should take the job.
292,Monica,Really?
293,Chandler,Yeah.
294,Chandler,I know it must be important to you when you   start chattering like a monkey.
295,Monica,That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!
296,Ross,Hey!
297,Monica,How was the pediatrician?
298,Rachel,"Oh, I really liked him."
299,Rachel,"Yeah, it   was really, really, really good."
300,Ross,You promised you wouldn't say anything.
301,Rachel,I know.
302,Rachel,Ross still sees his pediatrician!!!
303,Rachel,I don't care!
304,Monica,Are you serious?
305,Monica,You still see Dr. Gettleman?
306,Ross,He's a brilliant diagnostician!
307,Chandler,Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
308,Rachel,"Ross, seriously!"
309,Rachel,You've gotta go to an appropriate   doctor.
310,Ross,Why?
311,Ross,Why?
312,Ross,"I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's   a great doctor, okay?"
313,Ross,"He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there,   he makes a big deal."
314,Ross,"'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'"
315,Chandler,Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer   in your touchy?
316,Ross,"Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security   blanket to college!"
317,Chandler,That was not a security blanket!
318,Chandler,That was a wall-hanging!
319,Ross,It didn't spend much time on the wall!!
320,Phoebe,Sure.
321,Phoebe,Why did you go along with that?
322,Phoebe,That's true.
323,Phoebe,"Well, is anything you told me   about yourself true?"
324,Phoebe,Prove it.
325,Phoebe,That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.
326,Phoebe,You are really good!
327,Phoebe,I play a little guitar myself.
328,Phoebe,Uhuh.
329,Phoebe,"Well, like acoustic folksy stuff."
330,Phoebe,You know?
331,Phoebe,But right   now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers.
332,Phoebe,It's okay.
333,Phoebe,"Go ahead, ask me out."
334,Phoebe,"Oh, you just caught me off guard!"
335,Phoebe,"Yeah,   that would be nice."
336,Joey,Look at this.
337,Joey,My two best friends!
338,Ross,"Excuse me, I don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby   with the rash came in after me."
339,Ross,With the circus?
340,Ross,He's behind the elephant.
341,Ross,"Yeah, that's how I know."
342,Ross,I'm Ross by the way.
343,Ross,I am a single parent.
344,Ross,"Well, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the   pediatrician's office."
345,Ross,"Hmm, yeah."
346,Ross,Come   on Ross jr.
347,Ross,It's time to go in.
348,Ross,"Hey, I helped you find Waldo!"
349,Ross,"Oh good, you haven't left yet."
350,Monica,Where have you been?
351,Ross,I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office.
352,Ross,There was   some guy that freaked everybody out.
353,Chandler,"Well, you got here just in time."
354,Chandler,I really have   to go buddy.
355,Ross,Oh man.
356,Monica,Promise to call me when you land.
357,Chandler,Of course I will call you.
358,Chandler,I love you.
359,Monica,I love you too.
360,Rachel,"Okay, wow, wow, wow."
361,Rachel,"Watch the tongue people, we've   got a baby over here."
362,Phoebe,Bye Chandler.
363,Chandler,Awww.
364,Chandler,Bye!
365,Rachel,Bye honey.
366,Chandler,What's the   matter Joe?
367,Joey,I'm mad at you for leaving!
368,Joey,You're nothing but a big   leaver.
369,Joey,Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.
370,Chandler,Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make   all this easier?
371,Joey,"Dude, you see right thru me!"
372,Chandler,"Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!"
373,Phoebe,"Okay, bye-bye!"
374,Phoebe,Good   trip!
375,Monica,"Chandler, wait."
376,Monica,It
377,Chandler,I know.
378,Monica,I love you so much.
379,Chandler,I know that too.
380,Chandler,"Don't worry, I'll be back before   you know it."
381,Chandler,Yes it will be the same.
382,Chandler,"Because I know, that's how."
383,Chandler,I promise.
384,Chandler,CUT
385,Joey,Double promise?
386,Joey,Call me   when you land.
387,Monica,Can I talk now?
388,Joey,"Okay, bye."
389,Monica,Joey?
390,Joey,He had to board.
