44,Rachel,What?
45,Monica,It's some of Richard's hair!
46,Monica,What do I do with this?

58,Monica,"I know, I know."
59,Monica,I'm just so tired of-of missing him.
60,Monica,I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called.

110,Phoebe,"Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that."
111,Rachel,Really!
112,Phoebe,"Um, um."
113,Phoebe,It's huge.
114,Phoebe,"Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know."
115,Rachel,Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?
116,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah, um-mm."
117,Phoebe,Oh!

133,Rachel,"You really, really need to get some sleep, honey."
134,Monica,I know I do.

141,Phoebe,"Rach, look!"
142,Phoebe,"Oh, hi!"
143,Phoebe,Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me.

145,Chandler,Hey!
146,Joey,Wheel!
147,Chandler,Of!
148,Joey,Fortune!
149,Joey,This guy is so stupid.
150,Joey,It's Count Rushmore!
151,Chandler,"You know, you should really go on this show."
152,Chandler,"All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight."
153,Chandler,What'd ya' say?
154,Joey,"I say, 'I am there!'"
155,Joey,Cool!
156,Joey,"Aw, is Ross going to?"
157,Chandler,"No, Janice."
158,Joey,Jan-ice.
159,Joey,"'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers."
160,Chandler,"You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?"
161,Joey,"No, Yeeees."
162,Joey,"God, how do I say this."
163,Joey,"Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?"
164,Chandler,"Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!"
165,Joey,"Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know."
166,Chandler,"Well, there you go."
167,Joey,"Oh, hey."
168,Joey,"Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?"
169,Chandler,"Well, I'm crazy about her now."
170,Chandler,I think this could be the real thing.
171,Chandler,Capital 'R'!
172,Chandler,Capital 'T'!
173,Chandler,"Don't worry, those are the right letters."
174,Joey,"Look, what do you want me to say?"
175,Chandler,I want you to say that you like her!
176,Joey,I can't.
177,Joey,"It's like this chemical thing, you know."
178,Joey,"Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna  pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her."
179,Chandler,Thanks for trying.
180,Chandler,"Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!"
181,Joey,"Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?"
182,Joey,Commercial Break
183,Ross,How could you have told her?
184,Rachel,"Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal."
185,Ross,"Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal."
186,Rachel,"Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?"
187,Ross,"Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us."
188,Rachel,"Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything."
189,Rachel,"You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff."
190,Ross,"That's different, okay."
191,Ross,"That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?'"
192,Ross,or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?
193,Ross,'.
194,Rachel,Were both of those Joey?
195,Ross,Yeah.
196,Ross,"Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her."
197,Rachel,Not even with your best friend.
198,Ross,Noo!
199,Rachel,That is so sad.
200,Rachel,"Your missing out on so much, Ross."
201,Rachel,"I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know."
202,Rachel,And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.
203,Ross,Hmph.
204,Ross,"So what you, you tell each other everything?"
205,Rachel,Pretty much.
206,Ross,Did you talk about the night of five times?
207,Ross,Do you tell people about the night of five times?
208,Rachel,"Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol."
209,Ross,"I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think."
210,Phoebe,Relax every muscle in your body.
211,Phoebe,Listen to the plinky-plunky music.
212,Phoebe,"Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place."
213,Phoebe,"Okay, tell me your happy place."
214,Monica,"Richard's living room, drinking wine."
215,Phoebe,All right.
216,Phoebe,"No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass."
217,Phoebe,And get out!
218,Monica,"I'm sorry, but that's my happy place."
219,Phoebe,"Well, okay, fine, use my happy place."
220,Phoebe,"Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything."
221,Monica,"All right, I'll try not to."
222,Phoebe,"Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky...."
223,Monica,Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
224,Phoebe,"All right, there are no questions in the happy place."
225,Phoebe,"Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees...."
226,Monica,"I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine."
227,Phoebe,"All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place."
228,Phoebe,Okay.
229,Phoebe,"Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains."
230,Phoebe,And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
231,Monica,"Okay, this isn't working."
232,Monica,I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
233,Joey,"I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that."
234,Joey,And you got a 'hate' from that?!
235,Joey,Your taking a big leap there...
236,Joey,But what does that gonna do...
237,Joey,Okay.
238,Joey,I'm in.
239,Joey,Does it have to be a whole day?
240,Joey,"Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room."
241,Monica,"So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War."
242,Monica,He loved the Civil War.
243,Phoebe,"Monica, do you want us to take you home?"
244,Monica,"Uh, huh."
245,Monica,"Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away."
246,Ross,Women tell each other everything.
247,Ross,Did you know that?
248,Chandler,"Umm, yeah."
249,Ross,"No Chandler, everything!"
250,Ross,"Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth...."
251,Chandler,Girth?
252,Chandler,"Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?"
253,Ross,"Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it."
254,Ross,Do you wanna?
255,Chandler,We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
256,Ross,Nooo!
257,Chandler,"Yeah, okay."
258,Ross,Yeah?
259,Chandler,Yeah!
260,Chandler,All right!
261,Chandler,You go first.
262,Ross,"Okay, okay, I'll go first."
263,Chandler,Okay.
264,Ross,"So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing...."
265,Chandler,Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
266,Ross,Yes!
267,Chandler,I know!
268,Ross,Yes!
269,Ross,"Wow, well, that-that was easy."
270,Ross,"Okay, you-you go."
271,Chandler,Okay.
272,Ross,Okay.
273,Chandler,"Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman."
274,Ross,Hmph.
275,Chandler,"And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her."
276,Chandler,"And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place...."
277,Ross,With the belly-button ring?
278,Ross,"Oh, muhawa!"
279,Chandler,"I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head."
280,Chandler,"And your like 'Mom, get outta here!'"
281,Chandler,"You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing."
282,Chandler,"So it's kinda like, you're, you know."
283,Chandler,You know.... You don't know!
284,Ross,"Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?"
285,Chandler,You said...
286,Ross,I said 'share' not 'scare'.
287,Ross,Go sit over there!
288,Joey,Hey!
289,Chandler,What are you guys doing together?
290,Chandler,Really.
291,Joey,"Yeah, yeah."

293,Joey,You have got competition buddy.
294,Chandler,You still can't stand her can you?
295,Joey,"I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did."
296,Chandler,"Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot."
297,Joey,"But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she."
298,Joey,It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
299,Chandler,"Well, I guess that's something."
300,Joey,"No man, that's huge!"
301,Joey,"Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway."
302,Chandler,Okay.
303,Joey,"Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross."
304,Chandler,Oh God!
305,Joey,"Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too."
306,Chandler,Really?
307,Joey,"Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex."
308,Monica,"Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?"
309,Monica,Mr.
310,Monica,"I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them."
311,Monica,"So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?"

321,Monica,Mr.
322,Monica,Really!
323,Monica,Mr.
324,Monica,You're not just saying that are you?
325,Monica,Mr.
326,Monica,Was he crying?
327,Monica,Mr.
328,Monica,"Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?"
329,Monica,Mr.
330,Monica,I think so.
331,Monica,Mr.
332,Rachel,"Okay, here we go."
333,Rachel,"I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face."
334,Rachel,What?
335,Rachel,"Honey, what is it?"
336,Rachel,Did I get it wrong?
337,Rachel,Did I get the hair wrong?
338,Rachel,What?
339,Rachel,Did you just picture it differently?
340,Rachel,What?
341,Rachel,What?
342,Ross,"No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's  Mrs."
