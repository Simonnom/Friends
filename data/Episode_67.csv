29,Rachel,"Hi, Pheebs?"
30,Rachel,"Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming."
31,Phoebe,What?
32,Ross,Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
33,Phoebe,"Oh my God, she's so stupid!"
34,Ross,"Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay."
35,Phoebe,"That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your vagina!"
36,Rachel,"Honey, listen, y'know what?"

58,Monica,That's what it sounded like.
59,Chandler,All right
60,Phoebe,No-no-no!
61,Phoebe,We haven't started yet.
62,Phoebe,Where's Alice?
63,Chandler,"Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing."
64,Rachel,Monica?
65,Rachel,You gonna be very proud of me.
66,Rachel,I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
67,Joey,Oh my!
68,Rachel,They're male nurses.
69,Joey,Not in my head.
70,Rachel,"Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night!"
71,Rachel,What do you say?
72,Monica,Umm.
73,Monica,Umm.
74,Monica,Umm.
75,Monica,I don't think so.
76,Rachel,What?
77,Rachel,What are you talking about?!
78,Rachel,You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on.
79,Rachel,"I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me."
80,Rachel,"Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go."
81,Monica,"Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true."
82,Rachel,What?
83,Monica,Harder than it sounds.
84,Monica,Isn't it?
85,Rachel,"Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them."
86,Joey,Yep!
87,Joey,There's always room for Jell-O
88,Rachel,"Joey, how do you make that dirty?"
89,Joey,"Oh, it's easy."
90,Joey,"Yeah, I-I can do it with anything."
91,Joey,"Watch uh,  Grandma's chicken salad"
92,Joey,Ross!

94,Joey,Hey babies!
95,Joey,These are the headlines on the day you were born!
96,Joey,"Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies  Check it out, huh?!"
97,Joey,This is what naked women looked like the month you were born.
98,Joey,"All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff."
99,Phoebe,"Oh, okay, I'm having another one!"
100,Phoebe,"This one doesn't hurt eitherOoh, yes it does!"

106,Phoebe,"Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it."
107,Ross,"Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?"
108,Joey,"Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out."
109,Joey,Maybe they're with them.
110,Chandler,Really?

112,Joey,"Yeah, I was bummed too."
113,Chandler,So they're going on dates?
114,Chandler,When?
115,Joey,I think Saturday.
116,Phoebe,"Umm, sympathy pains."
117,Phoebe,"I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder."
118,Phoebe,Dr.
119,Phoebe,Hey.
120,Phoebe,Dr.
121,Chandler,"This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?"
122,Chandler,Dr.
123,Chandler,All right.
124,Phoebe,It's very weird!
125,Phoebe,"I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!"
126,Ross,"To be fair, he doesn't seem to be impersonating Fonzie"
127,Phoebe,What are you doing?!!
128,Phoebe,Why are you defending him?!
129,Phoebe,Just get me another doctor!
130,Phoebe,One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
131,Ross,"Again, it's not that he"
132,Chandler,Oh-hey-hey-hey!
133,Chandler,There you are!
134,Monica,"Umm, listen there's something I think you should know."
135,Chandler,"Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse?"
136,Chandler,"Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine."
137,Chandler,"I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around."
138,Monica,"Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him."
139,Chandler,Fine!
140,Chandler,Maybe I will too!
141,Joey,"Hey, you guys!"
142,Joey,Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop.

148,Phoebe,Hi!
149,Phoebe,And you're going into what grade?
150,Phoebe,Dr.
151,Phoebe,"Uh-huh, me too."
152,Phoebe,"Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor."
153,Phoebe,Dr.
154,Phoebe,Shh!
155,Phoebe,"Doogie, shh!"
156,Phoebe,Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon?
157,Phoebe,Huh?

198,Phoebe,Okay?
199,Phoebe,"Just, y'know, feel him out!"
200,Rachel,No!
201,Rachel,Forget it!
202,Rachel,I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!
203,Phoebe,You're right.
204,Phoebe,Tell him it's for you.
205,Monica,Feeling a little better sweetie?
206,Joey,"Well, maybe a little."

294,Monica,Great!
295,Chandler,"So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?"
296,Monica,"Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him."
297,Chandler,"Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together."
298,Chandler,"But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary."
299,Chandler,I am so bad at this.
300,Monica,I think you're better than you think you are.
301,Chandler,Really?
302,Chandler,"Okay, so"
303,Monica,Know when to stop.

324,Phoebe,"Oh, I had the most fun with you guys!"
325,Phoebe,I wish I could take you home and see you everyday.

342,Chandler,"So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?"
343,Phoebe,They're gonna call her Chandler.
344,Chandler,"That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?"
345,Phoebe,Works on you.
346,Phoebe,End
