4,Joey,Is this what it's like to be you?
5,Monica,"Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?"
6,Joey,"Oh, you have no idea."
7,Joey,"And-and when we're on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart!"
8,Phoebe,"Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this!"

10,Ross,"Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away."
11,Monica,Yes!!

13,Monica,"Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
14,Ross,We were all pretty shaken up about it.
15,Phoebe,"Wait, am I missing something though?"
16,Phoebe,"Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way."
17,Ross,"Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person."
18,Monica,"Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch!"
19,Monica,And I'm sorry she died.

31,Monica,"Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!!"

33,Chandler,My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.

70,Phoebe,"That's a dog, every house should have a dog."
71,Monica,Not one that can pee on the roof.
72,Phoebe,"Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste."
73,Chandler,And is this in case the house sneezes?
74,Phoebe,"No, no, that's the ghost for the attic."
75,Monica,I don't want a ghost.
76,Phoebe,"Well, nobody wants a ghost."
77,Phoebe,"But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground."
78,Ross,"Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground?"
79,Ross,That would never happen.
80,Phoebe,"Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government."

210,Chandler,Okay?
211,Chandler,"All I said was, This was fun."
212,Chandler,Let's do it again sometime.
213,Chandler,I'll give you a call.'
214,Rachel,"Ohh, gee."
215,Rachel,I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
216,Chandler,That's what you say at the end of a date.
217,Rachel,"You can't just say, Nice to meet you, good night?'"
218,Chandler,To her face?
219,Chandler,"Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out."
220,Chandler,"I can't help it, it's a compulsion."
221,Monica,"Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call."
222,Monica,Hasn't it ever happened to you?
223,Rachel,"Well, they always called."
224,Monica,"Hmm, bite me."
225,Rachel,No.

235,Rachel,Why hasn't he called Rachel?
236,Rachel,Why?
237,Rachel,Why?
238,Rachel,I don't understand.
239,Rachel,Why?
240,Rachel,He said he'll call.
241,Rachel,Why?
242,Rachel,Why?
243,Rachel,"Chandler I'm telling you she has flipped out, she's gone crazy!"
244,Chandler,"Oh, well give me the phone then."
245,Rachel,"Come on, this isn't funny."
246,Rachel,She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her.
247,Rachel,You have to call her!
248,Chandler,"Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'"
249,Rachel,Well then you're going to have to take her out again.
250,Chandler,Nooo!!
251,Chandler,She's really dull!
252,Chandler,And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
253,Rachel,I don't care!
254,Rachel,I don't care!
255,Rachel,"You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended."
256,Rachel,"And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!"
257,Chandler,All right!
258,Chandler,Fine!
259,Chandler,"But it's just a lunch date, no more than an hour!"
260,Chandler,"And from now on I get my own dates, I don't want you setting me up with anybody ever again!"
261,Rachel,That's fine!
262,Chandler,"That's just a lot of big talk, y'know."
263,Rachel,I know.
264,Ross,Mon?
265,Monica,I'm in the shower!
266,Ross,"Oh, fire!"

272,Joey,"Y'know, about what happened with us."
273,Joey,What are you talking about?
274,Joey,It was a big deal.
275,Joey,"I mean, come on you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you."
276,Joey,"I-I was there, you're not that good an actress."
277,Joey,Nooo.

296,Phoebe,What is this?
297,Ross,"No Phoebe, don't look!"
298,Ross,You don't want to see what's under there!
299,Phoebe,"Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!"
300,Chandler,It's not a big deal.
301,Chandler,"It's, just it's right here,  and it's all the time."
302,Chandler,"Yes, this, this was pleasant."
303,Chandler,"The food there was, was great."
304,Chandler,So take care.

316,Rachel,"Okay, you are going to tell her and you're going to tell her now."
317,Chandler,AhhhhI'm not going to call you.
318,Chandler,I'm sorry.
319,Chandler,I'm-I'm-I'm sorry that I said I was going to when I'm not.
320,Chandler,"Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know?"
321,Chandler,And this isn't Rachel's fault.
322,Chandler,It's me.
323,Chandler,"I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women."
324,Chandler,"I have issues with commitment, intimacy,  mascara goop."
325,Chandler,"And I'm really sorry, it's just that this is not, this isn't going to work out."
326,Chandler,"Yeah, o-okay."
