123,Rachel,"All right, it's okay."
124,Rachel,"One little setback is okay, just don't let it happen again, all right?"
125,Rachel,"Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away."
126,Rachel,But I'm just gonna take the-the pajmena.
127,Rachel,"And the uh, and the uh pants."
128,Rachel,"Y'know what, I'm just gonna take it all away, cause that way you'll just really learn the lesson."

147,Chandler,"Yeah, I don't you should say that even when you're healthy."
148,Monica,Come on.

162,Phoebe,No.
163,Phoebe,No.
164,Phoebe,"It's just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them."

178,Rachel,"Oh my God, and they're gonna have sex!"
179,Rachel,Oh!
180,Rachel,Oh no what if he marries her too?!
181,Rachel,"Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible."
