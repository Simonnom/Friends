144,Ross,What?!
145,Ross,Hello!
146,Ross,We didn't get married.
147,Rachel,"No, we didn't get married!"
148,Rachel,That's ridiculous!
149,Ross,We-we-weI remember being in a chapel.
150,Rachel,Oh my God.
151,Ross,IThey would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
152,Rachel,No!
153,Joey,They let you get married when you're drunk!
154,Joey,Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!
155,Phoebe,"Hell, I'm drunk right now!"
156,Phoebe,What?
157,Phoebe,I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?!
158,Phoebe,I'm on vacation!
159,Monica,What are you guys gonna do?
160,Rachel,"Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer?"
161,Chandler,"Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one."
162,Chandler,"Now, this one's free, right?"
163,Chandler,"Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free."
164,Ross,"Laugh it up, but the joke's on you."
165,Ross,"Because we don't need to get divorced, okay?"
166,Ross,We we're just gonna get an annulment.
167,Joey,An annulment?
168,Joey,Ross!
169,Joey,I don't think surgery's the answer here.
170,Phoebe,"Oh-oh, that's your thing."
171,Ross,What?
172,Phoebe,You're thing.
173,Phoebe,You're thing.
174,Phoebe,Y'know?
175,Phoebe,You're the guy who gets divorced.
176,Ross,"No-no, that's-that's not my thing!"
177,Ross,I do not love getting divorced!
178,Phoebe,Yes you do!
179,Phoebe,This is your third divorce!
180,Phoebe,You love divorce so much you're probably gonna marry it!
181,Phoebe,"Then it won't work out and you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy."
182,Phoebe,I'm so drunk.
183,Monica,"So, what do you think we should do?"
184,Chandler,I don't know.
185,Chandler,But I-I-I know I love you!
186,Monica,I know I love you!
187,Chandler,So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing?
188,Chandler,I love you.
189,Monica,That's a good question.
190,Monica,"Look umm, last night we let the dice decide."
191,Monica,Maybe we should leave it up to fate again.
192,Monica,I love you!
193,Chandler,"Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign!"
194,Chandler,"Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight  then there's a definite sign that we should get married."
195,Monica,"All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married."
196,Chandler,Sounds great.
197,Monica,Okay.
198,Monica,Ready?
199,Chandler,Ready!
200,Monica,Come on eight.
201,Chandler,"Yes, yes eight."
202,Monica,Wow!
203,Monica,I can't believe I actually rolled an eight.
204,Chandler,That was so unlikely.
205,Chandler,"Well, let's get married!"
206,Chandler,I guess.
207,Monica,Wait a minute.
208,Monica,That wasn't a hard eight!
209,Monica,Last night I rolled a hard eight.
210,Chandler,That's right!
211,Chandler,"It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding!"
212,Chandler,Damnit!
213,Monica,I wanted it so bad!
214,Monica,Wanna go pack?
215,Chandler,Yeah.
216,Chandler,"We're doing the right thing, right?"
217,Monica,"Ohh, of course we are!"
218,Monica,We left it up to fate.
219,Monica,If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.
220,Phoebe,"Okay, you have 19 questions left."
221,Phoebe,Use them wisely.
222,Phoebe,Come on Joey!
223,Phoebe,You can't win if you don't ask any  QUESTIONS!!
224,Joey,What?
225,Phoebe,"Well, you promised me a fun road trip!"
226,Phoebe,We've been on the road six hours and you've been asleep for five and a half!
227,Phoebe,We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back!
228,Phoebe,"That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!"
229,Joey,All right.
230,Joey,All right.
231,Phoebe,Yeah!
232,Phoebe,And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio's broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
233,Joey,Really?
234,Joey,I don't
235,Phoebe,Sing!
236,Joey,I wanna rock and roll all night!
237,Joey,"Man, this is a long drive!"
238,Joey,Are my eyes open?
239,Joey,No!
240,Ross,Hey!
241,Rachel,"Hey, hubby!"
242,Ross,Yeah.
243,Ross,"Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?"
244,Rachel,Uh-huh.
245,Ross,I'm not going to do that.
246,Ross,Commercial Break
247,Rachel,Okay!
248,Rachel,"So, we'll just stay married."
249,Ross,"Yes, exactly!"
250,Rachel,And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
251,Ross,Wow!
252,Ross,This is so amazing.
253,Ross,"I uh, I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more."
254,Rachel,"Okay, see now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding."
255,Ross,I'm-I'm not kidding.
256,Ross,"Look I-I, I can't have three failed marriages."
257,Ross,I can't.
258,Ross,Okay?
259,Ross,I-I am not gonna be that guy!
260,Rachel,What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?
261,Ross,"Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you?"
262,Ross,Really?
263,Ross,I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.!
264,Ross,It's right next to it!
265,Rachel,"Ohh, okay, I'm sorry."
266,Rachel,You're right.
267,Rachel,Y'know what?
268,Rachel,"We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other."
269,Rachel,"All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you're asking of me."
270,Ross,I'm asking you to do me a favor.
271,Ross,{Note
272,Rachel,You are asking me to be your wife!
273,Ross,And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
274,Monica,That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
275,Chandler,Well you did pull his hair.
276,Monica,He took my snack!
277,Chandler,I'm not getting into this again!
278,Monica,Okay!
279,Monica,"Oh God, y'know what?"
280,Monica,It's really bad.
281,Chandler,"Well, I told you not to walk."
282,Chandler,Here.
283,Chandler,There.
284,Chandler,Okay.
285,Monica,"This doesn't mean anything, does it?"
286,Chandler,No!
287,Monica,Okay.
288,Phoebe,How could you pick up a hitchhiker?!
289,Phoebe,"He could be a rape, a rapist or a killer or something!"
290,Joey,Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?
291,Phoebe,Y'know what?
292,Phoebe,I'm not talking to you!
293,Phoebe,You go back to sleep!
294,Phoebe,"And you, are you a rapist?"
295,Phoebe,Do you like car games?
296,Phoebe,I love the license plate game!
297,Joey,"Ooh, I'll play!"
298,Joey,I'll play!
299,Phoebe,No-No!
300,Phoebe,You need your sleep.
301,Phoebe,Night-night!
302,Phoebe,Shh!
303,Ross,Hey!
304,Rachel,Hey!
305,Ross,"Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married."
306,Ross,"We register, and you get to keep all the presents!"
307,Rachel,No!
308,Rachel,"Ross, come on!"
309,Rachel,No!
310,Rachel,"Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married."
311,Ross,I don't know if it's true.
312,Rachel,Oh b-b-but it is!
313,Ross,"Oh, okay, y'know what this is?"
314,Ross,This is a difference of opinion.
315,Ross,And when that happens in a marriage...
316,Rachel,"Oh Ross, come on!"
317,Rachel,"This is not, this is not a marriage!!"
318,Rachel,This is the world's worst hangover!
319,Rachel,"Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!"
320,Ross,All right.
321,Ross,"All right, I'll do it."
322,Rachel,Thank you.
323,Rachel,"Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?"
324,Phoebe,"Oh, okay."
325,Phoebe,"And I have your name and the fact that you're a drifter, so the ball's pretty much in your court."
326,Joey,Come on Pheebs!
327,Joey,I can't take this anymore!
328,Joey,Let-let me make it up to you.
329,Joey,Huh?
330,Joey,Ground control to Major Tom.
331,Joey,"Commencing countdown, engines on."
332,Joey,Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
333,Phoebe,Stop it!
334,Phoebe,Stop it no!
335,Phoebe,That's not fair!
336,Phoebe,Y'know I can't resist that beautiful voice!
337,Joey,"Pheebs, I am so sorry!"
338,Joey,I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver.
339,Joey,But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship!
340,Joey,"So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you."
341,Phoebe,You can still sleep at night and stuff.
342,Joey,"Well, thank you."
343,Joey,"So, can we play 20 Questions now?"
344,Joey,I've got a really good one!
345,Joey,I've been thinking about it since Kansas.
346,Phoebe,Okay.
347,Phoebe,Is it a kind of hot sandwich?
348,Joey,Yes.
349,Phoebe,Is it a meatball sub?
350,Joey,That is incredible!
351,Joey,You are the master!
352,Rachel,"Huh, that's funny."

358,Chandler,"All right, should we just, should we just get married?"
359,Chandler,Y'know?
360,Chandler,I mean should we just do it?
361,Chandler,All the signs are telling us to do it.
362,Monica,I'm sick of the signs!
363,Monica,"It's too fast, I'm happy the way things are!"
364,Chandler,Me too!
365,Monica,I don't want things to change!
366,Monica,Do you?
367,Chandler,No!
368,Monica,"All right then, then nothing changes!"
369,Monica,Everything is great!
370,Monica,Everything stays the same!
371,Monica,And you go unpack because it's been three days and it's driving me insane!
372,Chandler,"Jeez, relax!"
373,Chandler,It's not like we're mar-ah-ah!
374,Chandler,"Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?"
375,Monica,Then all your stuff would be here.
376,Chandler,"Well, what if all my stuff was here?"
377,Monica,"Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense."
378,Chandler,Okay.
379,Chandler,What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
380,Monica,Live together?
381,Monica,There have been no signs for that.
