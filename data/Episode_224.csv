0,Chandler,"Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica?"
1,Chandler,I can't figure this out!
2,Chandler,It's so hard!
3,Chandler,Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or aah-ah!
4,Chandler,Paper cut!
5,Phoebe,"Now, have you told anyone else?"
6,Chandler,"No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out."
7,Phoebe,You told me.
8,Chandler,"Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures."
9,Phoebe,"Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off."
10,Phoebe,I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet.
11,Chandler,Me too.
12,Joey,Hey.
13,Chandler,Hey.
14,Phoebe,Hey!
15,Phoebe,"So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?"
16,Chandler,Oh all right.
17,Phoebe,"Yeah, coffeehouse."
18,Ross,"Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go."
19,Chandler,"Oh well, we don't because we gottheother pl-place."
20,Ross,How rude.
21,Joey,"Oh, I'm sorry."
22,Joey,You wanna bite?
23,Joey,Opening Credits
24,Phoebe,So how are things going with Paul?
25,Rachel,Good.
26,Rachel,"Although y'know, he-he's a private guy."
27,Rachel,"Y'know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings."
28,Phoebe,That's easy!
29,Phoebe,You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.
30,Rachel,So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
31,Phoebe,No that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
32,Rachel,Hi!
33,Phoebe,Watch this.
34,Rachel,Okay.
35,Phoebe,Hi Paul!
36,Phoebe,So how are things going with you?
37,Rachel,Okay.
38,Ross,Hi!
39,Ross,Great to see you!
40,Ross,How you doing?
41,Ross,Okay!
42,Ross,You take care!
43,Ross,"Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?"
44,Phoebe,Yeah!
45,Phoebe,"That was so weird, huh?"
46,Ross,"Phoebe, why'd you do it?"
47,Phoebe,I didn't do it!
48,Phoebe,It was Chandler!
49,Phoebe,He's He's mad at you!
50,Ross,What?!
51,Ross,Why?
52,Phoebe,"Please, I think you know why."
53,Ross,I can't think of anything.
54,Phoebe,"Come on Ross, you're a paleontologist, dig a little deeper."
55,Ross,"Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn't invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?"
56,Phoebe,Do you think that's something that he'd be mad at you for?
57,Ross,I guess it could.
58,Phoebe,Well then I think that's it.
59,Ross,"Well, if he's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up."
60,Ross,I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.
61,Phoebe,"Oh, if that's what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table."
62,Rachel,Yeah that's great.
63,Rachel,"But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me."
64,Rachel,Tell me about your day.
65,Rachel,Okay.
66,Rachel,"Hey, what are you thinking?"
67,Rachel,What are you thinking right now?
68,Rachel,"Yeah that's great Paul, but y'know I wanna know whatWow, those are really great!"
69,Rachel,"I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior."
70,Rachel,Y'know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.
71,Rachel,"No Paul, I don't know anything about you!"
72,Rachel,"Y'know, like-like your childhood!"
73,Rachel,Tell me about your childhood!
74,Rachel,"Okay, well then how about puberty!"
75,Rachel,"Come on, that's always a painful time!"
76,Rachel,Y'know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you're sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
77,Rachel,"Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky."
78,Rachel,"Anyway, umm The rest of you life, y'know?"
79,Rachel,Any regrets?
80,Rachel,"All right Paul, I'm not asking for a lot here."
81,Rachel,Okay?
82,Rachel,Just give me something.
83,Rachel,Anything!
84,Rachel,Okay.
85,Rachel,All right.
86,Rachel,Hm-mmm.
87,Rachel,That's-that's great!
88,Rachel,See?
89,Rachel,I already feel like I know you a little better!
90,Rachel,Thank you.
91,Rachel,"Okay, come on."
92,Rachel,Now we can go eat.
93,Rachel,Let's go.
94,Rachel,Oh!
95,Rachel,Yeah.
96,Rachel,"Yeah, I-I-I see the scare."
97,Rachel,"Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y'know, you shared your feelings."
98,Rachel,"It's really, it's beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?"
99,Rachel,What?!
100,Rachel,Wait!
101,Rachel,What are you talking about?!
102,Rachel,You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
103,Rachel,"My God, I'm sorry!"
104,Rachel,I'm sorry!
105,Rachel,I didn't mean to do that!
106,Rachel,I wouldn't do that!
107,Chandler,Nothin!
108,Chandler,This is the nine millionth ring store we've been too and I can't find the perfect ring!
109,Chandler,Ugly ring!
110,Chandler,Ugly ring!
111,Chandler,Ugly ring!
112,Chandler,It's a beautiful selection.
113,Phoebe,"Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring."
114,Phoebe,Maybe you-maybe you do something different.
115,Phoebe,Y'know?
116,Phoebe,"Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y'know?"
117,Phoebe,Or an engagement tiara?
118,Phoebe,Orooh!
119,Phoebe,An engagement Revolutionary War musket!
120,Phoebe,(Picks one up from the display in the corner.
121,Chandler,"Y'know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this."
122,Phoebe,Huh?

170,Joey,"Oh, we're supposed to just get him a ticket?!"
171,Joey,That guy is always mooching off of us!
172,Ross,Yeah!
173,Ross,"Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y'know?"
174,Ross,"Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him."

176,Joey,And I still have his credit card.
177,Ross,Oh.
178,Joey,"Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one."

193,Monica,"Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up."
194,Monica,And one of them is sex.
195,Rachel,What's the other one?
196,Monica,"I don't know, I've never had to use the other one."
197,Monica,"I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking."
198,Rachel,Oh that's right.
199,Rachel,You're the talker.
200,Rachel,"Anyway uh, great idea!"
201,Rachel,"Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues."

253,Phoebe,I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail!
254,Chandler,They put you in jail?
255,Phoebe,The little jail between the doors!
256,Chandler,"Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!"
257,Phoebe,"I know, I'm sorry!"
258,Phoebe,"But y'know, this ring is better!"
259,Phoebe,Monica never even saw the other ring.
260,Chandler,Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
261,Phoebe,Maybe it was the guy.
262,Chandler,It was the ring!
263,Ross,Hey!
264,Ross,"So uh, was he excited about the tickets?"
265,Joey,No!
266,Joey,He blew us off!

294,Rachel,"Wait, now wait a second, this isn't too revealing is it?"
295,Rachel,I don't care about the little dude!
296,Rachel,I can't!
297,Rachel,I cannot listen to anymore of this!
298,Rachel,"Y'know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional!"
299,Rachel,And then it's only because they get paid $100 an hour!
300,Rachel,Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you?
301,Rachel,"$2,000!"
302,Rachel,And do you know when I figured that out?
303,Rachel,While you were talking!
304,Rachel,Oh I'm sorry.
305,Rachel,I I-I don't meanI didn't mean to stifle you.
306,Rachel,I This is all just a little overwhelming.
307,Rachel,"I'm so glad, I'm so glad you shared."
308,Rachel,And I'm glad that you're done.
309,Rachel,What do you say we umm
310,Phoebe,Hey.
311,Chandler,I can't believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
312,Phoebe,It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring!
313,Phoebe,It's a beautiful ring!
314,Chandler,"No, it's not!"
315,Chandler,"When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y'know?"
316,Chandler,And I could see her saying yes.
317,Chandler,"When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring!"
318,Chandler,Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye.
319,Chandler,"Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life."
320,Chandler,I wanna make sure it's perfect.
321,Phoebe,Okay.
322,Phoebe,There may be a way that we can get the other ring back.
323,Phoebe,Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose.
324,Phoebe,So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
325,Chandler,I can't do that.
326,Phoebe,Well you certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.
327,Phoebe,There he is!
328,Chandler,Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
329,Phoebe,Wow!
330,Phoebe,You're good!
331,Phoebe,"After this, we should solve crimes."
332,Chandler,Yeah!
333,Chandler,"Okay, go, go, go get him."
334,Phoebe,"Oh, okay."
335,Phoebe,Excuse me sir?
336,Phoebe,Could you come with me please?
337,Phoebe,You have a phone call.
338,Phoebe,It is your office.
339,Phoebe,John?
340,Phoebe,Here he is.
341,Chandler,Hi!
342,Chandler,Hi.
343,Chandler,"Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you're about to propose with was supposed to be held for me."
344,Chandler,"So, I'm gonna need to have that back."
345,Chandler,"But, in exchange I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring."
346,Chandler,Ew.
347,Phoebe,Wow!
348,Phoebe,I would trade.
349,Chandler,No-no!
350,Chandler,This is my fiancee  and her heart was set on that ring.
351,Chandler,You don't want to break her heart now do you?
352,Phoebe,"Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman's heart?"
353,Chandler,"Yeah, she's dying Of a cough apparently."
354,Phoebe,"Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring."
355,Phoebe,"See, if I'm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity"
356,Chandler,"Okay, that's enough honey!"
357,Chandler,Great!
358,Chandler,"Okay, here."
359,Chandler,Thank you.
360,Chandler,Thank you.

373,Joey,Oh my God!
374,Ross,So you two are really serious?
375,Chandler,"Yep, pretty much."
376,Ross,You-you're gonna get married?!
377,Ross,I mean We're gonna be brothers-in-law!
378,Joey,"And-and-and-and-and-and, and we're gonna be friends again!"
379,Chandler,HeyyyyWhat?
380,Joey,"Oh it's water under the bridge, forget it!"
381,Chandler,Okay!
382,Chandler,"I was gonna wait til uh, it was official y'know?"
383,Chandler,But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you're my best friends.
384,Joey,I think I'm gonna cry!

404,Phoebe,"Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring."
405,Ross,You told her before you told us?
406,Chandler,"Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures."
407,Chandler,"You can understand that, right?"
408,Chandler,Guys?
