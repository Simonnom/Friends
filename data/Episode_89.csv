386,Phoebe,Oh here's a whole bunch.
387,Rachel,"Oh, I mean she's gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, ""Oh that poor girl."""
388,Rachel,Y'know?
389,Rachel,Then she'll have to come back here and live all alone.
390,Phoebe,Oh my God!
391,Rachel,What?
392,Phoebe,"There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it's positive."
393,Phoebe,Monica's pregnant.

402,Rachel,"No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night."
403,Phoebe,"Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever!"
404,Phoebe,The bride is pregnant.
405,Phoebe,The groom is missing.
406,Phoebe,And I'm still holding this.
407,Rachel,"Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this."
408,Phoebe,Right.
409,Rachel,Okay?
410,Phoebe,"Yeah, okay."
411,Phoebe,"Hey, wait."
412,Phoebe,Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?

414,Rachel,Why?
415,Phoebe,"Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it."
416,Rachel,Anything?
417,Ross,No!
418,Ross,"I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn't heard from him."
419,Ross,I-I-I talked to Chandler's parents again!
420,Phoebe,You told them he was missing?
421,Ross,No!
422,Ross,I made it seem like I was just calling to chat.
423,Ross,"Pretty sure, they both think I'm interested in them."
424,Rachel,"All right, we've got to tell her he's gone."
425,Ross,No!
426,Ross,Hey!
427,Ross,Hey!
428,Ross,We can't!
429,Rachel,"Ross, she's gonna start getting ready soon!"
430,Ross,"Well, can't you at least stall her a little?"
431,Ross,I'll-I'll go back to some of the places I went last night.
432,Rachel,"All right, well how much time do you need?"
433,Ross,Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
434,Rachel,One hour.
435,Ross,Give me two.
436,Rachel,Then why do you ask?
437,Ross,"Okay, wish me luck."
438,Phoebe,Okay.
439,Phoebe,I'm going with you.
440,Ross,Why?
441,Phoebe,"Ross, you're tired."

444,Rachel,"All right, I'll see you guys later."
445,Phoebe,Okay.
446,Phoebe,"Wait, do you know how you're going to stall her?"
447,Rachel,I'll figure something out.

449,Phoebe,Good luck.
450,Rachel,Thanks.
451,Monica,Hey!
452,Monica,"Okay, so I thought we'd start with my make up and then do my hair."
453,Rachel,"Okay uh, but before you do that."
454,Rachel,"I-I, I need you to talk to me."
455,Monica,About what?
456,Rachel,Umm I'm never gonna getting married!

462,Rachel,"Oh, maybe I should just forget about it."
463,Rachel,Become a lesbian or something.
464,Monica,Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
465,Rachel,Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
466,Monica,Rachel!
467,Monica,You okay?
468,Joey,"Excuse me, Aaron?"
469,Joey,Hi!
470,Joey,"Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules."

498,Phoebe,"He could be in disguise, y'know."
499,Ross,"Aw, y'knowY'know, maybe we're-we're just approaching this all wrong."
500,Ross,"If you're Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you'd go?"
501,Ross,So this is your office?

504,Phoebe,What the hell are you doing?
505,Chandler,Panicking!
506,Chandler,And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica.
507,Chandler,How is she?
508,Ross,She's fine.
509,Ross,She doesn't know you're gone.
