3,Chandler,Yes please.
4,Chandler,He's a he?
5,Chandler,...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that.
6,Chandler,"I mean, is that ridiculous?"
7,Chandler,Can you believe she actually thought that?
8,Rachel,Um... yeah.
9,Rachel,"Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be..."
10,Chandler,You did?
11,Rachel,"Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not."
12,Chandler,Huh.
13,Chandler,"Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?"
14,Monica,I did.
15,Phoebe,"Yeah, I think so, yeah."
16,Joey,Not me.
17,Ross,"Nono, me neither."
18,Ross,"Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did."
19,Chandler,You're kidding!
20,Chandler,Did you tell her I wasn't?
21,Ross,No.
22,Ross,"No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so..."
23,Chandler,"Well, this is fascinating."
24,Chandler,"So, uh, what is it about me?"
25,Phoebe,"I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny..."
26,Chandler,"Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?"
27,Chandler,WHAT IS IT?
28,Monica,"Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality."
29,Chandler,"Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this."

33,Monica,"Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome."
34,Rachel,Oh my God!

40,Rachel,"Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick?"
41,Rachel,Talking to Rome.
42,Rachel,I'm talking to Rome.
43,Monica,"Hey dad, what's up?"
44,Monica,Oh God.
45,Monica,"Ross, it's Nana."
46,Ross,"So, uh, how's she doing?"
47,Ross,Aunt
48,Monica,"How-how are you, Mom?"
49,Monica,Mrs.

53,Monica,Mrs.
54,Monica,"She is unbelievable, our mother is..."
55,Ross,"Okay, relax, relax."
56,Ross,"We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover."
57,Monica,Oh God!
58,Monica,The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
59,Ross,Oh!
60,Ross,"...Yeah, they were gross."
61,Ross,"Oh, you know what I loved?"
62,Ross,Her Sweet 'n' Los.
63,Ross,How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
64,Ross,Mr.
65,Ross,She looks so small.
66,Monica,I know.
67,Ross,"Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now."
68,Monica,"G'bye, Nana."
69,Ross,"Bye, Nana."
70,Monica,Ross!
71,Monica,Mrs.
72,Ross,Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed?
73,Ross,"Well, she's not, quite.. Mrs."
74,Ross,"She's not- past, she's present, she's back."
75,Ross,Aunt
76,Ross,"I, uh, I'll go see."
77,Ross,Now she's passed.
78,Chandler,"I just have to know, okay."
79,Chandler,Is it my hair?
80,Rachel,"Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is."
81,Rachel,It's your hair.
82,Phoebe,"Yeah, you have homosexual hair."
83,Rachel,"So, um, did she..."
84,Ross,Twice.
85,Joey,Twice?
86,Phoebe,"Oh, that sucks!"
87,Joey,You guys okay?
88,Ross,"I dunno, it's weird."
89,Ross,"I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh..."
90,Phoebe,Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
91,Ross,"Nono, she's gone."
92,Monica,We checked.
93,Monica,A lot.
94,Phoebe,"Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes."
95,Phoebe,"Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know?"
96,Phoebe,Oh!
97,Phoebe,"And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know?"
98,Phoebe,...I miss her.
99,Rachel,Aw.
100,Rachel,"Hey, Pheebs, want this?"
101,Phoebe,Thanks!
102,Rachel,Sure.
103,Rachel,I just sharpened her this morning.
104,Joey,"Now, see, I don't believe any of that."
105,Joey,"I think once you're dead, you're dead!"
106,Joey,You're gone!
107,Joey,You're worm food!
108,Joey,"...So Chandler looks gay, huh?"
109,Phoebe,"Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie."
110,Ross,I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
111,Ross,Mrs.
112,Ross,I don't see why not.
113,Ross,Here's my retainer!
114,Monica,Dad!

123,Monica,Mr.
124,Chandler,"Hey, gorgeous."
125,Chandler,"No, nono, don't- don't worry about it."
126,Chandler,"Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake."
127,Chandler,"So, uh... what do you think it is about me?"
128,Chandler,"...Quality, right, great."
129,Chandler,Lowell?
130,Chandler,"Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?"
131,Chandler,"Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll."
132,Chandler,No!
133,Chandler,"Uh, I d'know!"

135,Chandler,Excuse me?
136,Chandler,You don't think I could get a Brian?
137,Chandler,Because I could get a Brian.

184,Joey,"Check it out, Giants-Cowboys."
185,Chandler,You're watching a football game at a funeral?
186,Joey,"No, it's the pre-game."
