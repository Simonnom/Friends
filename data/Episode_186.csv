43,Joey,"Well that, that sounds good."
44,Rachel,Yeah but how do I start?
45,Rachel,"I mean, what's-what's the first thing that I say?"
46,Rachel,Okay great!

49,Monica,Good luck!
50,Phoebe,"Yeah, bye."

53,Monica,"Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby."
54,Chandler,What?!
55,Chandler,I didn't even know thatWhy didn't you tell me?!
56,Chandler,Why am I talking like this?
57,Monica,I didn't think you could keep it a secret.
58,Chandler,What?!
59,Chandler,I am an excellent secret keeper.
60,Chandler,I have kept all of our secrets.
61,Joey,What secrets?
62,Chandler,"Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper."
63,Joey,You'll tell me later?
64,Chandler,You already know.
65,Chandler,Opening Credits
66,Phoebe,"Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon."
67,Joey,"Y'know, Monica and Chandler are married."
68,Joey,Ross and Rachel are having a baby.
69,Joey,Maybe you and I should do something.
70,Phoebe,All in good time my love.
71,Phoebe,All in good time.
72,Phoebe,Oh shoot!
73,Phoebe,I left my guitar in their apartment.
74,Phoebe,Well you can let me in later.
75,Joey,"I don't have a key, they took mine to give to you."
76,Phoebe,What?!
77,Phoebe,They took mine to give to you!
78,Joey,Why would they take away our keys?
79,Phoebe,Maybe they don't trust us.
80,Joey,No that's not it.
81,Joey,They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.
82,Phoebe,You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica's guest towels?
83,Joey,"Hey, I washed those!"
84,Phoebe,No you didn't.
85,Joey,Yeah that didn't sound like me.
86,Phoebe,"Well, what am I gonna do?"
87,Phoebe,I really need my guitar!
88,Joey,"Yeah, I have stuff in there too."
89,Phoebe,What stuff?
90,Joey,Monica's chicken parm!
91,Joey,I'll take care of it.
92,Joey,"Hey Mr. Treeger, it's Joey Tribbiani."
93,Joey,"Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler's apartment."
94,Joey,It's an emergency.
95,Joey,"Uhh, gas leak!"
96,Joey,"Yeah oh, and bring garlic bread."
97,Ross,Hey!
98,Phoebe,Did Rachel find you?
99,Ross,No why?
100,Phoebe,Oh she was looking for you.
101,Ross,"Oh well, I guess I'll catch up with her later."
102,Phoebe,"Well, she really wanted to talk to you now."
103,Joey,"Yeah, it seemed pretty important."
104,Ross,Oh no.
105,Phoebe,What?
106,Ross,I think I might know what this is about.
107,Joey,Really?
108,Ross,Yeah.
109,Ross,"Uh, uh we promised we weren't gonna tell anybody this but uh, about a month ago Rachel and I slept together."
110,Phoebe,And?
111,Ross,Wow!
112,Ross,I thought you would be a little more shocked.
113,Phoebe,Oh sorry.
114,Phoebe,And?
115,Ross,"Well, we-we said we'd just do it that one time but, but now I think she may wanna start things up again."
116,Joey,"Yeah, I don't think that's what it is."
117,Ross,Why?
118,Ross,What-what else could it be?
119,Joey,"Oh wow, I don't feel well."
120,Ross,I'm telling you.
121,Ross,I'm telling you.
122,Ross,That's what it is.
123,Ross,No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding.
124,Ross,She didn't say anything to you?
125,Phoebe,Maybe it's something you ate?
126,Joey,"Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel."
127,Ross,"Yeah, I guess I should."
128,Ross,"Man, y'know what I have to realize?"
129,Ross,Maybe I'm just not the type of guy women can have just one night with.
130,Ross,"Y'know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more."
131,Ross,I should remember that.
132,Monica,They're kissing let's just go around them.
133,Chandler,"Oh honey, leave them alone, they're in love."
134,Monica,I'm in love too!
135,Monica,But in an orderly fashion.
136,Monica,Ticket
137,Monica,Hi!
138,Monica,Can you do that and walk?
139,Monica,"Cause she said, ""Next."""
140,Monica,Did you hear that?!
141,Monica,They bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon!
142,Monica,Come on!
143,Monica,Let's act like we're on our honeymoon.

153,Monica,Ticket
154,Monica,"You see, if we'd gone around them like I said, weShe would've given us those tickets."
155,Monica,Damnit!
156,Chandler,"25J and K, any chance those aren't together?"
157,Joey,I still can't believe they took away my key.
158,Joey,You trust me with yours.
159,Phoebe,Of course I do!
160,Phoebe,And I'm gonna give it back to you as soon as they're done with it at the key shining place.
161,Joey,What the hell is that?
162,Joey,(They go into the hallway and see Mr. Treeger watching one of New York's bravest breakdown Monica and Chandler's door with an ax.]
163,Joey,Whoa!
164,Joey,Whoa!
165,Joey,Whoa!
166,Joey,"Treeger, what are you doing?"
167,Joey,Mr.

203,Ross,"Look uh, I know why you're here."
204,Rachel,You do?
205,Ross,"Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first."
206,Rachel,Okay.
207,Ross,Okay.
208,Ross,"Uh, Ross and Rachel."
209,Ross,Rachel and Ross.
210,Ross,That's been one heck of a see-saw hasn't it?
211,Rachel,What?
212,Ross,"I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun andand certainly passionate, but don't you think it's better if we just stayed friends?"
213,Rachel,Seriously.
214,Rachel,What?
215,Ross,Okay.
216,Ross,Okay.
217,Ross,Y'know what?
218,Ross,"If you want to, we can do it one more time."
219,Ross,I mean I'd-I'd be okay with that.
220,Ross,"In fact, I have some time right now."
221,Rachel,"Okay, y'know what?"
222,Rachel,"Can I, can I talk now?"
223,Ross,Oh sure.
224,Rachel,I'm pregnant.
225,Rachel,Ross?
226,Rachel,Ross?
227,Rachel,"Okay, whenever you're ready."
228,Rachel,And you're the father by the waybut you got that Commercial Break
229,Rachel,Can I get you some water?
230,Ross,I'm good.
231,Ross,I'm good.
232,Rachel,"Ross, there is no pressure on you."
233,Rachel,Okay?
234,Rachel,I mean you can as involved as you want.
235,Ross,"Yeah, I need uh I'm justI don't knowI don't understand, umm, how this happened?"
236,Ross,We-we used a condom.
237,Rachel,I know.
238,Rachel,"I know, but y'know condoms only work like 97% of the time."
239,Ross,What?
240,Ross,What?
241,Ross,What?!!
242,Ross,Well they should put that on the box!!
243,Rachel,They do!
244,Ross,No they don't!!!
245,Ross,Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!
246,Rachel,Okay Ross come on let's just forget about the condoms.
247,Ross,Oh well I may as well have!
248,Rachel,"Listen, y'know what?"
249,Rachel,I was really freaked out too when I found out
250,Ross,Freaked out?
251,Ross,"Hey no, I'm not freaked out!"
252,Ross,I'm indignant!
253,Ross,As a consumer!
254,Rachel,Y'know what?
255,Rachel,"Let's, let's talk later."
256,Ross,No!
257,Ross,No!
258,Ross,I want to talk now!
259,Ross,Okay?
260,Ross,"IIn fact,  I am going to talk to the president of the condom company!"
261,Rachel,"Okay, y'know maybe I should come back"
262,Ross,Shh!
263,Ross,Shh!
264,Ross,Shh!
265,Rachel,Okay.
266,Ross,Yeah I'll press 1!
267,Joey,Huh.
268,Joey,So then I can heat this up?
269,Joey,Mr.
270,Phoebe,Oh great!
271,Phoebe,"And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this?"
272,Phoebe,"Cause y'know umm, they don't-they don't have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them."
273,Phoebe,Mr.
274,Phoebe,Oh no.
275,Phoebe,Mr.
276,Ross,Hi.
277,Ross,Mr.
278,Ross,Sure.
279,Ross,Mr.
280,Ross,Namaste.
281,Ross,Oh my God!
282,Ross,What happened to the door?
283,Joey,So it's noticeable huh?
284,Ross,"Look, is Rachel here?"
285,Ross,I really need to talk to her.
286,Phoebe,Didn't you two already talk?
287,Ross,"Yeah but uh Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept together, but there's something else."
288,Ross,Rachel's pregnant.
289,Joey,Oh my God!!!
290,Joey,I can't believe that!
291,Phoebe,Holy mother of God!!
292,Ross,With my child.
293,Phoebe,That is brand new information!
294,Ross,You already know don't you?
295,Phoebe,A little bit.
296,Joey,How are you doing?
297,Ross,Okay.
298,Ross,Okay.
299,Ross,I mean I'll be okay.
300,Ross,It's just I don't think I handled it very well.
301,Joey,"Well, what did you say to her?"
302,Ross,Nothing.
303,Ross,But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful.
304,Ross,And then when I turned around she was gone.
305,Phoebe,Oh Ross.
306,Ross,"But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective."
307,Joey,What?
308,Ross,I gotta go find her.
309,Joey,Whoa!
310,Joey,Hey!
311,Joey,Whoa!!
312,Joey,Hold up!
313,Joey,Are you serious?!
314,Joey,So like 3% of the time they don't even work?!
315,Joey,Huh?
316,Joey,They should put that on the box!
317,Ross,Evidently they do.
318,Joey,What?
319,Monica,I can't believe we're here.
320,Chandler,Oh you've got to be kidding me.
321,Monica,What?
322,Monica,Front Desk
323,Monica,No!!
324,Monica,You have been screwing us all day!
325,Chandler,We're you just ten seconds later!
326,Monica,Yeah!
327,Monica,You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge!
328,Monica,I mean we should get free stuff too!
329,Monica,I mean you're not the only ones on your honeymoon!
330,Chandler,We need the stuff.
331,Joey,Hey Monica it's Joey.
332,Joey,"Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin' from your apartment."
333,Monica,What?
334,Monica,Are you serious?!
335,Monica,Joey smells gas!
336,Chandler,What else is new?
337,Joey,"Yeah and we'd go check it out, but you took away our keys."
338,Monica,Well do something!
339,Monica,Get in there!
340,Joey,How?
341,Joey,I guess I could break down your door.
342,Monica,Yeah!
343,Monica,Do that!
344,Joey,And-and you won't blame us for any damage?
345,Monica,No!
346,Monica,Are you doing it?!
347,Monica,I don't hear anything!
348,Monica,Come on!
349,Joey,"Uh, okay I'll-I'll-I'll break it down."
350,Phoebe,"Oh hey hi, he's doing it."
351,Phoebe,He's breaking down the door.
352,Phoebe,"Okay, we're in."
353,Rachel,"If I said I was, would you judge me?"
354,Rachel,Okay.
355,Rachel,"Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery Barn"
356,Ross,Hi!
357,Rachel,Hi!
358,Ross,Uh we-we need to talk.
359,Rachel,"Uh-uh-uh, right now?"
360,Rachel,Because I've kinda got an el fresco situation going on over here.
361,Ross,"Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today."
362,Rachel,"Okay Ross that's fine, but can you please stand near my head?"
363,Ross,What?
364,Ross,Oh yeah.
365,Ross,I'm sorry.
366,Ross,I mean I-I think I went a little crazy.
367,Ross,I mean I was thinking about myself when I  reallyI should have been thinking about you Rach
368,Rachel,Okay.
369,Rachel,Head Ross!
370,Rachel,Head Ross!
371,Rachel,Head Ross!
372,Ross,Right!
373,Ross,Right!
374,Ross,"I justI want you to know that I'm going to be there through this whole thing, okay?"
375,Ross,Okay?
376,Ross,"The doctor's appointments, the uh, the Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartmentAlthough we could probably worry about that til after we get married."
377,Rachel,What married?
378,Ross,"Well yeah, I think we should get married."
379,Rachel,"What, because that's your answer to everything?"
380,Ross,"No, because that's the right thing to do."
381,Rachel,"Yeah, maybe if you're in love."
382,Rachel,"But Ross, we are not in love, are we?"
383,Ross,No butbut still you can't possibly do this alone.
384,Rachel,Excuse me?
385,Ross,"Come on Rach, you can't even eat alone in a restaurant."
386,Rachel,What?
387,Ross,"I'm just saying if you can't eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?"
388,Rachel,I can too eat by myself!
389,Ross,When have you ever?
390,Rachel,When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!
391,Ross,Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!
392,Rachel,"Oh please, you inhale your food!"
393,Ross,I grew up with Monica!
394,Ross,If you didn't eat fast you didn't eat!!
395,Ross,Dr.
396,Rachel,"Oh no Dr. Long, please come in."
397,Rachel,"This is Ross, he is the father."
398,Ross,"But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone."
399,Ross,Dr.
400,Ross,I don't know why you can't admit that you need me.
401,Rachel,I do need you!
402,Rachel,I need you to stand near my head!
403,Rachel,Dr.

416,Rachel,"I know, I lied!"
417,Rachel,I didn't want her to think I was a terrible mother!
418,Rachel,I can't even see my own baby!
419,Ross,"Oh sure, come here!"
420,Ross,Sure you can!
421,Ross,"Uh, look come here look,  it's-it's-it's, it's right there ."
