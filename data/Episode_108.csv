2,Rachel,Umm.
3,Rachel,Does everybody hate these shoes?
4,Chandler,"Oh yeah, but don't worry."
5,Chandler,I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
6,Rachel,Tell him.
7,Ross,It's her first day at this new job.
8,Ross,Your not supposed to start with her!
9,Chandler,"All right, I suppose I can wait a day."
10,Chandler,"Hey, what are you doing Friday?"
11,Ross,Why?
12,Chandler,"I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist."
13,Ross,Oh God.
14,Ross,"Y'know, botanists are such geeks."
15,Chandler,Yeah.
16,Chandler,Is that a dinosaur tie?
17,Ross,Hmm?
18,Ross,"Oh, yeah."
19,Phoebe,Morning.
20,Phoebe,"Rach, I'm here with the purses!"
21,Chandler,It must take you forever to find your keys.
22,Rachel,"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs."
23,Phoebe,"Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles."
24,Rachel,"No, no, no, no turtles scare me."

27,Ross,"Hey, umm,."

29,Rachel,"Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out."
30,Ross,"Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?"
31,Rachel,"Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing."
32,Rachel,Is this actually a lunchbox?
33,Phoebe,"Umm, no, it's a purse."
34,Phoebe,And there's a thermos in it.
35,Rachel,Oh.
36,Chandler,"Hey, so can you make it on Friday?"
37,Ross,What?
38,Ross,"Oh yeah, yeah I think so."
39,Ross,Why am I invited to this again?
40,Chandler,Well apparently Albert has no friends.
41,Chandler,He's very excited about the bachelor party though.
42,Chandler,I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
43,Phoebe,"A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich√©."
44,Phoebe,Why don't you get a magician?
45,Chandler,"Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right."
46,Chandler,Opening Credits

48,Ross,She's having lunch with him.
49,Ross,And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job.
50,Ross,"And, and, and,  he's really good looking."
51,Ross,What am I gonna do?
52,Chandler,Don't do anything.
53,Chandler,Keep it inside.
54,Chandler,Learn how to hide your feelings!
55,Chandler,Don't cry outloud.

168,Phoebe,He was with her when he wrote this poem.
169,Phoebe,"Look,  'My vessel so empty with nothing inside."
170,Phoebe,"Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.'"
171,Phoebe,"He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!"
172,Chandler,You really think that is what he meant?

189,Ross,"...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!"
190,Rachel,"Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious!"
191,Rachel,It was like you were marking your territory.
192,Rachel,I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!
193,Ross,I would never do that!
194,Rachel,"Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me."
195,Rachel,He said this is what you guys do.
196,Ross,"Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot."
197,Joey,Mark's a genius!
198,Ross,Why?!
199,Ross,How?!
200,Ross,How is he a genius?
201,Chandler,"Look, don't you see what's happening here."
202,Chandler,"Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant."
203,Chandler,Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
204,Ross,What am I going to do?
205,Chandler,"Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that."
206,Chandler,"All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits."
207,Ross,I don't know you guys.
208,Chandler,"All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you."
209,Chandler,"And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'"
210,Joey,"And before you know it, she's with him."
211,Joey,"And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!'"
212,Joey,"And he'll be all, 'Yes!'"
213,Joey,"And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.'"
214,Joey,"And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.'"
215,Joey,"And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'"
216,Chandler,He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
217,Rachel,Ohhh!
218,Rachel,That is soo sweet!
219,Ross,"All right that's, that's it!!"
220,Ross,Get off her!
221,Ross,What's going on?!
222,Ross,That's what's going on!
223,Rachel,Ross!
224,Ross,I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie!
225,Ross,What do I have to do to get some service?!
226,Ross,Hi Rach.
227,Joey,"So, does that mean the audition is off?"
228,Joey,What?
229,Joey,"It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands."

234,Monica,"Oh-ho, look what I got Julio."
235,Phoebe,"Yeah, it's a vase."
236,Monica,"Yeah, just like the one in the poem."
237,Phoebe,Well not exactly like the one in the poem.
238,Monica,What do you mean?
239,Phoebe,Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry?
240,Phoebe,Oh.
241,Monica,So!
242,Monica,"I'm just an empty vase, huh?"
243,Monica,"Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else."
244,Monica,"And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog."
245,Monica,"Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things."
246,Monica,I care about my friends and family.
247,Monica,You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.
248,Monica,You don't even know me...
249,Monica,What?
250,Monica,"I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe..."
251,Monica,Oh yeah.
252,Joey,"I know, it was the best I could get out of them."
253,Joey,"People, people, people."
254,Rachel,"So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?"
255,Chandler,"Oh yeah, yeah!"
256,Chandler,"Look what I got, look what I got."
257,Chandler,"See, she's fully dressed, right?"
258,Rachel,Right.
259,Chandler,"And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked."
260,Chandler,"And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed."
261,Chandler,"She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and  whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked!"
262,Ross,Hi.
263,Rachel,Hello.
264,Chandler,"Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen."
265,Ross,"I'm sorry, I was an idiot."
266,Rachel,A big idiot.
267,Ross,A big idiot.
268,Ross,"Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me."
269,Rachel,"Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?"
270,Ross,"Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her."
271,Ross,And now if it's possible I think I love you even more.
272,Ross,"So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away."
273,Rachel,"Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous."
274,Ross,I gotta get going.
275,Ross,Bye Chandler.
276,Chandler,"Oh, okay Ross."
277,Chandler,"Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?"
278,Rachel,Where ya going?
279,Ross,"Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon."
280,Rachel,"Ohh, with who?"
281,Ross,"Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party."
282,Rachel,There was a woman at the...
283,Rachel,The stripper?
284,Ross,Yeah.
285,Rachel,You have a play date with a stripper?
286,Chandler,"Man, I gotta get a kid."
287,Ross,"Ah, yeah, yeah."
288,Ross,"Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing."
289,Ross,"And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class."
290,Ross,"Why, is that okay?"
291,Rachel,"Sure, is she married?"
292,Ross,"Ahh, no."
293,Rachel,Oh.
294,Ross,Are you jealous?
295,Rachel,"Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all."
296,Rachel,I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
297,Ross,You are totally jealous.
298,Rachel,I'm not jealous.
299,Rachel,"All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers."
300,Rachel,"And y'know, and um, I..."
301,Ross,"Honey, I love you too."
302,Rachel,Ugh.
303,Rachel,"Wait, wait, wait."
304,Ross,What?
305,Ross,Huh.
306,Rachel,"Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know."
307,Chandler,Yeah.
308,Chandler,"Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper."
309,Chandler,Closing Credits
