103,Monica,But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.
104,Joey,I did.
105,Joey,I thought it'd be great.
106,Joey,"I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think."
107,Phoebe,"Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?"
108,Joey,You really think he'd take me?
109,Joey,"I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad."
110,Monica,"I promise you, he would definitely want you back."
111,Ross,"I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back."
112,Chandler,But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night.
113,Chandler,"I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together."
114,Ross,"Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright."
115,Ross,"And he's happy, he's, he's decorated."
116,Rachel,"Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too."
117,Chandler,But...
118,Ross,No.
119,Ross,"You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK, you're not... rommmates anymore."
120,Phoebe,"OK.  Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you?"
121,Phoebe,"Smelly cat  Oh woah, oh my God."

127,Phoebe,"Smelly cat  OK, sorry."
128,Phoebe,"I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat acually is."
129,Phoebe,"I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat."
130,Phoebe,Oh OK.
131,Phoebe,"So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go."
132,Ross,"No, there is no way he was a velociraptor."
133,Ross,"No Tony, look at the cranial ridge, OK."
134,Ross,"If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones."
135,Ross,"Yeah, yeah."
136,Ross,"Oh, were you takin' a nap?"

264,Ross,Why did you hate me?
265,Monica,"Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way."
266,Ross,And that wasn't fun for you?

284,Phoebe,"You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video."
285,Phoebe,Yes.
286,Rachel,"Well, how did you find out?"
287,Phoebe,"Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me."
288,Phoebe,That was my first clue.
289,Monica,So what're you gonna do?
290,Phoebe,"Well, I can't work with people who would do this."
291,Monica,Sure.
292,Phoebe,I mean this poor woman.
293,Ross,What woman?
294,Phoebe,The voice woman.
295,Phoebe,"Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video."
296,Rachel,"OK, Phoebs."
297,Rachel,But what about you?
298,Phoebe,"Well I have a video, you have to pay attention."
299,Phoebe,"No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know."
300,Phoebe,"I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know."
301,Phoebe,"Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and."
302,Phoebe,"Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat."

316,Phoebe,Chandler.
317,Chandler,You're obviously not their favorite pet.
318,Monica,Joey.
319,Joey,It may not be a bed of roses.
320,Phoebe,Rachel.
321,Rachel,And you're no friend to those with noses.
