17,Joey,Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
18,Phoebe,Wait.
19,Phoebe,Why was he yelling at her?
20,Phoebe,He's the one who slept with someone else.
21,Joey,"Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now."
22,Phoebe,Whoa!!
23,Phoebe,He is soo unreasonable!
24,Phoebe,"God, although I think I understand what he means."
25,Phoebe,"Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow."
26,Chandler,Y'know what this is like?
27,Chandler,This is like when my parents got divorced.

30,Phoebe,"And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy...."
31,Joey,I had the same dream!

96,Rachel,Hi!
97,Rachel,"Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend?"
98,Rachel,"Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing."
99,Rachel,Huh?

101,Rachel,I mean I'm playing by the rules.

104,Rachel,What are you doing?
105,Chandler,"Hey, shut up!!"

126,Monica,"We're really sorry, but um, she did ask us first."
127,Ross,"Yeah, that's okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I'm alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand."
128,Phoebe,"Y'know what, I can stay, I'm gonna stay."
129,Phoebe,"Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around."
130,Joey,"Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother's cab, but y'know what, I'll stay."

140,Chandler,"Well, then, I might as well offer to stay."
141,Joey,"Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?"
142,Monica,Why?
143,Monica,Do you think he's still mad at us?
144,Chandler,Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
145,Joey,What?
146,Joey,Mine aren't tinted.
147,Phoebe,Chandler!
148,Chandler,What?
149,Phoebe,What does the sign say?

180,Joey,"Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open."
181,Joey,Anybody have a coat hanger?
182,Chandler,Oh I do!
183,Chandler,"Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning."
184,Monica,"So, if you're parents hadn't got divorced, you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?"
185,Joey,"Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it."
186,Joey,"Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!"

197,Monica,"Please, it's gotta be Rachel."
198,Rachel,"What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra."
199,Monica,"All right then, your bra would still be big."
200,Rachel,"No, I stuff outside the bra."
201,Chandler,"Ladies, ladies, let's just compromise okay?"
202,Chandler,"Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica's bra."
203,Phoebe,"All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine."
204,Rachel,"Chandler, what are you doing?"
205,Rachel,There is a trash can right there.
206,Chandler,"Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us."
207,Phoebe,"Okay, there."
208,Joey,"Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous."
209,Chandler,"Okay, now let's decide who has the nicest ass."
210,Joey,And there you go!

229,Ross,"Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great."
230,Ross,"Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know."
231,Ross,"Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up."
232,Ross,"Yeah, well."
233,Ross,"Oh yeah, I'd love that."
234,Ross,I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
235,Phoebe,"Okay, yeah."
236,Phoebe,Triple A can pick us up.
237,Rachel,Great!
238,Phoebe,"Yeah, what town are we near?"

241,Phoebe,Then why are you answering?
242,Phoebe,Do you at least know what route we're on?
243,Rachel,"Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27."
244,Phoebe,Okay.
245,Phoebe,We are at a rest stop on Route 27.
246,Phoebe,Okay.
247,Phoebe,There is no Route 27.
248,Phoebe,"Okay, either 93 or 76?"
249,Rachel,"I don't know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here."
250,Phoebe,Okay.
251,Phoebe,"Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93?"
252,Phoebe,Okay!
253,Phoebe,"Yeah, no they don't do that."
254,Rachel,"Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us."
255,Monica,Who?
256,Monica,I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half?
257,Monica,"I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up."
258,Rachel,No!
259,Rachel,"No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!"
260,Phoebe,But if...
261,Rachel,"No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you'll have to think of something else."
262,Phoebe,"Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back."
263,Monica,So the going for help went well?
264,Joey,"Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed."
265,Chandler,I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
266,Monica,Then why are you smoking?
267,Chandler,Well it's very unsettling.
268,Ross,....right?
269,Ross,Right?
270,Ross,"I mean it's pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back."
271,Ross,"Y'know I don't, I don't need them, huh, I've got you guys now as friends, you and Susan."
272,Ross,717?
273,Ross,Where's 717?
274,Ross,"Hey, you've have more of these for Susan right?"
275,Phoebe,"Ross, thank God."
276,Ross,Pheebs?
277,Ross,"What, why are you whispering?"
278,Phoebe,I ate a bug.
279,Monica,"Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny."
280,Monica,Let's stock up.
281,Phoebe,"Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck."
282,Ross,"Oh, now you want a favour?"
283,Phoebe,"Yes, please."
284,Ross,"Well, oh, I'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?"
285,Ross,"No, I'm not gonna pick them up."
286,Ross,"No, Rachel doesn't want me to...."
287,Ross,"Yeah, you're right."
288,Ross,We were on a break!!!
289,Ross,Okay!!

292,Ross,I'll find you.
293,Ross,"Oh, you-you're-you're one to talk."
294,Joey,"Okay, done."
295,Monica,What's pleh'?
296,Joey,That's help' spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!
297,Monica,Huh.
298,Monica,What's doofus spelled backwards?
299,Rachel,"Op, op, car!"
300,Rachel,Car!!

307,Ross,"He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I'm stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I've got plenty of people to help on the Interstate."
308,Rachel,All right!!
309,Rachel,Fine!
310,Rachel,Fine.
311,Joey,Arrrghh!
312,Chandler,"Oh no, now it's not gonna make any sense!"
313,Phoebe,"You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here?"
314,Phoebe,What do we do?
315,Phoebe,Just like send him back and we're then gonna go skiing?
316,Chandler,"Oh, this is horrible, it's just horrible."
317,Joey,"Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?"
318,Monica,"I know, what about Rachel?"
319,Monica,I mean how are we even gonna ask her?
320,Rachel,Ask me what?
321,Monica,"Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?"
322,Monica,"Chandler, Phoebe, and"

329,Ross,"Oh please, can't I come to your special, magical cabin?"
330,Rachel,Why would you even want to come Ross?
331,Rachel,You're a horrible skier.
332,Ross,"Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills."
333,Monica,Here we go again.

335,Chandler,"Y'know what, I can handle it, handle's my middle name."
336,Chandler,"Actually it's the ah, middle part of my first name."
337,Ross,"All right Pheebs, your cab's ready."
338,Rachel,"All right, let's go!"
339,Ross,You're welcome.
340,Rachel,"Oh, I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?"
341,Ross,We were on a break!
342,Rachel,Y'know Ross why don't you put that on your answering machine!
343,Ross,"Hey-hey, it's valid okay?"
344,Ross,"And I'm not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me."
345,Rachel,What?
346,Monica,I don't know.
347,Ross,That's what you said last night.
348,Monica,"What I said was, was that I understood."
349,Monica,Joey's the one who agreed with you!
350,Ross,Okay.
351,Rachel,Really Joey?
352,Joey,What?
353,Phoebe,"Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here."
354,Rachel,"No, I think it's very obvious who's wrong here."
355,Ross,Obviously not to Joey.

368,Phoebe,"You don't, all right you don't have to love each other, okay?"
369,Phoebe,"You don't, you don't even have to like each other much right now."
370,Phoebe,"But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other."
371,Joey,"Yeah, and not put us in the middle."
372,Phoebe,"Yeah, otherwise, I mean that's, that's, that's just it for us hanging out together."
373,Phoebe,Y'know is that what you want?
