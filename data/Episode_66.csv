10,Phoebe,"Oh, come on people  come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most!"

13,Chandler,It's an internship.
14,Joey,"Oh, that's cool."
15,Joey,We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'.
16,Chandler,Right.
17,Chandler,"So, it'll be the same except less sex with you."
18,Ross,"So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?"
19,Chandler,"Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like."
20,Phoebe,That's great.
21,Chandler,"Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating"
22,Chandler,Humiliating and noble!
23,Ross,"You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising."
24,Monica,"Ross, you did not come up with ""got milk?"""
25,Ross,"Yes, I did, I did!"
26,Ross,I should have written it down!

45,Rachel,Yes.
46,Joey,"Oh my god, that is great!"
47,Joey,"That is *** for a play on broadway and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time."
48,Monica,Is it a good play?
49,Joey,"Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe word."
50,Rachel,"Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it"
51,Joey,"Yeah, yeah, and directing."
52,Monica,He was so good in that movie of MacBeth.

64,Monica,Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!
65,Joey,Don't make me more nervous than I already am!
66,Chandler,"Good morning, everybody."
67,Chandler,"Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys except for the tie, the briefcase and the fact that I can rent a car."
68,Chandler,"Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom."
69,Chandler,Right.
70,Chandler,"Look, I know I'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope"
71,Chandler,The comedian?
72,Chandler,USO?
73,Joey,It is so amazing to meet you.
74,Joey,I'm such a big fan of your work.
75,Joey,Tell me about it!
76,Joey,"""Unlimited nights and weekends!"""
77,Joey,"No, I-I-I wasn't making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were great in those commercials."
78,Joey,Yeah.
79,Joey,Are you kiddin'?
80,Joey,When they shoot you out of that cannon
81,Joey,Wow!
82,Joey,"Oh, yah, sure."
83,Joey,"Err, ""I think you know""."
84,Joey,"""I am what you made me."
85,Joey,You know what?
86,Joey,"I could go right now."""
87,Joey,"""I can't."
88,Joey,"Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can't."""
89,Joey,"Oh, oh, I thought that was your character's name, you know, I thought you were like an Indian or something, you know with a"
90,Joey,"Ah, y-y-you're sure you don't want me to do it again?"
91,Joey,"I could do it with an accent, you know, Southern  ""I could go right now, maaan!"""
92,Joey,"Ah, hi, ah."
93,Joey,"Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did wrong, I'd just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you."
94,Joey,"And, and"
95,Joey,Yeah.
96,Joey,I really doubt that.
97,Joey,Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?
98,Phoebe,"Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?"
99,Ross,"Oh, I can't."
100,Ross,"I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her."
101,Phoebe,"Oh, I hear divorce bells."
102,Ross,What?
103,Ross,"O-ok. Just relax, Phoene, just stay calm."
104,Ross,"Oh my god, I can't find my wallet."
105,Phoebe,No.
106,Ross,"What do you mean ""no""?"
107,Ross,"I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay."
108,Phoebe,"Lowell, is that you?"
109,Phoebe,Oh my god!
110,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets."
111,Phoebe,"Lowell, Ross."
112,Ross,"Yeah, a real pleasure."
113,Phoebe,"Ah, it's been so long, so long."
114,Phoebe,I can't believe you're still doing this!
115,Phoebe,Good for you!
116,Phoebe,Ouh
117,Ross,Oh my god.
118,Ross,"Phoebe, you used to mug people?"
119,Phoebe,"Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up"
120,Monica,"Hey, how did the audition go?"
121,Joey,"Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me."
122,Monica,What happened?
123,Joey,"Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical."
124,Joey,"Oh, and he said that I should think less."
125,Monica,So far so good!
126,Chandler,"Honey, I'm old!"
127,Monica,What's wrong?
128,Chandler,I am so much older than these other interns.
129,Chandler,I can't compete with them.
130,Monica,So you're a little older.
131,Monica,Try to look at the
132,Chandler,"Yes, but I don't think life experience with these."
133,Joey,Wooooooooow  It's like they're on fire!
134,Monica,What are they?
135,Chandler,They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.
136,Joey,I give you $ 500 for them!
137,Chandler,What am I supposed to do with these?
138,Monica,"Ah, come on, sneakers are easy."
139,Monica,You wear sneakers all the time.
140,Chandler,"Well, first of all, they're not called ""sneakers"" anymore."
141,Chandler,"Apparently, they're called ""kicks"" or ""skids"" and I think I heard somebody say ""slorps""."
142,Chandler,"And here,"
143,Monica,"Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?"
144,Chandler,"No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for."
145,Joey,"Hey, that'd work on me!"
146,Joey,Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords?
147,Ross,"Hey, you'll never guess what just happened Phoebe and I got mugged!"
148,Monica,You okay?
149,Ross,"Yah, because Phoebe knew the mugger!"
150,Monica,How do you know a mugger?
151,Phoebe,I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us.
152,Ross,You wanna know how she knew him?
153,Ross,Because Phoebe used to mug people.
154,Monica,Seriously?
155,Phoebe,"Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I"
156,Monica,"Phoebe, that is awful!"
157,Phoebe,"Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer"
158,Monica,You're mother killed herself!
159,Phoebe,She was a drug dealer!
160,Ross,"Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because  I was about to do some serious damage!"
161,Phoebe,Okay
162,Monica,"Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross."
163,Phoebe,Why?
164,Monica,"Well, Ross was mugged as a kid."
165,Phoebe,You were?
166,Ross,"Yeah, it was pretty traumatic."
167,Ross,"I was outside St. Marc's Comics you know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week-"
168,Monica,Wonderwoman!
169,Ross,"Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone   when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and"
170,Phoebe,Oh my god
171,Ross,I know!
172,Ross,And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic
173,Monica,Oh yeah!
174,Monica,What was his superpower again?
175,Ross,A superhuman thirst for knowledge.
176,Monica,That's it.
177,Ross,"Well, I-I better get to class  Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe?"
178,Phoebe,"No actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street that's where stabby Joe works."
179,Phoebe,"Okay, I think we have a problem here."
180,Monica,What?
181,Phoebe,"Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics."
182,Monica,Yeah?
183,Phoebe,"Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat."
184,Monica,So?
185,Phoebe,"Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said- Phoebe and"
186,Monica,"""Geology rocks!"""
187,Monica,Oh my god!
188,Phoebe,I know I mugged Ross!
189,Joey,"I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?"
190,Joey,But I'm bursting with u-hu!
191,Joey,"Actually, I really need"
192,Joey,Yes ahahaaa
193,Joey,"""I think you know!"""
194,Joey,"""I am what you made me!"
195,Joey,"You know what?"""
196,Joey,"""I could go right now."""
197,Joey,"""I, oh, I can't."
198,Joey,"I want to, but I can't!"""
199,Joey,I did?
200,Joey,"Sure, yeah."
201,Joey,I don't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go.
202,Monica,Hey!
203,Chandler,Hey!
204,Monica,What are you doing?
205,Chandler,"Putting on the sneakers thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything"
206,Rachel,"Oh, anything yet?"
207,Chandler,"Yes, how's"
208,Joey,Hey!
209,Joey,Probably wanna know what I'm doing?
210,Monica,"No, that seems about right."
211,Joey,"Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor."
212,Joey,"I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything."
213,Joey,"Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!"
214,Rachel,"Joey, that was formula."
215,Joey,We gotta get more of that.
216,Chandler,You know what these aren't half-bad!
217,Chandler,You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.
218,Rachel,"Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph."
219,Chandler,Alright  I feel youger already!
220,Chandler,"Yah, I think I broke my hip."
221,Phoebe,"Hey, you!"
222,Ross,Hey!
223,Phoebe,"Hey, how was class?"
224,Ross,"No one ever asked me that, what's wrong?"
225,Phoebe,"Nothing, I really wanna know."
226,Ross,"Oh  Well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene"
227,Phoebe,"Alright, nothing is worth this."
228,Phoebe,"Uhm, I have a confession to make uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid"
229,Ross,Wh-What are you talking about?
230,Ross,It wasn't a girl.
231,Ross,It was this huge dude.
232,Phoebe,"You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl."
233,Ross,"No, it wasn't."
234,Phoebe,"Yes, it was."
235,Ross,"No, it wasn't."
236,Ross,You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old
237,Phoebe,"""Gimme your money, punk!"""
238,Ross,"Oh my god, it was you!"
239,Ross,"I can't believe it, you you mugged me?"
240,Phoebe,"Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat."
241,Phoebe,"I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have have a great one!"
242,Ross,It's not the best!
243,Phoebe,"I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me."
244,Phoebe,I don't know what to say
245,Ross,There's nothing you can say.
246,Ross,That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me.
247,Phoebe,Really?
248,Phoebe,Even more humiliating than
249,Ross,"Hey, let's not do this!"
250,Chandler,Okay  You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes.
251,Chandler,He's about my age
252,Chandler,A-huh.
253,Chandler,"So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know maybe he falls maybe hurts himself."
254,Chandler,"Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes."
255,Chandler,"He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line"
256,Chandler,"Oh, thank you, sir or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me"
257,Chandler,"I don't know, I don' I don' know!"
258,Chandler,"I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow."
259,Chandler,The cold weather hurts my hip!
260,Phoebe,"Hey, Ross!"
261,Phoebe,"I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second?"
262,Ross,"Sure, go ahead."
263,Ross,"Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead."
264,Phoebe,I just really wanted to apologize again and and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting.
265,Ross,"Oh my god, crap from the street?"
266,Phoebe,"Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell or smoke."
267,Phoebe,"Anyway, I was looking through it and I found ""Science Boy"""
268,Ross,Oh my god.
269,Ross,I never thought I'd see this again.
270,Ross,It's all here.
271,Ross,What made you save it all these years?
272,Phoebe,"I can't say, I just thought it was really good and maybe would be worth something some day."
273,Ross,"You really thought ""Science Boy"" was worth saving!"
274,Phoebe,"Yeah but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here."
275,Ross,"Still this is amazing Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe."
276,Phoebe,You're welcome.
277,Phoebe,"And thank you for ""Science Boy""."
278,Phoebe,I learned a lot from him
279,Ross,You're welcome.
280,Joey,"""I need an answer!"""
281,Joey,"""You know!"""
282,Joey,"""I need an answer now!"""
283,Joey,Oh!
284,Joey,"""You knew this all along and you never told me?"
285,Joey,You never told me?
286,Joey,"I can never forgive you, I can never forgive myself, I have nothing to live for  Bang  End Scene!"""
287,Joey,"Oh thanks, thanks!"
288,Joey,"Now, I really have to get"
289,Monica,"Wow, that's a big cable bill!"
290,Monica,"Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn on a Saturday afternoon?!"
291,Monica,I was in the house!
292,Ross,"Hey, uhm, Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that"
293,Monica,that she was the huge guy that mugged you?
294,Monica,Yah.
295,Ross,I see.
296,Ross,You didn't happen to tell
297,Monica,everybody we know?
298,Monica,Yeah.
299,Ross,Great.
300,Ross,Thanks!
301,Ross,End
