,Person,Said
0,Monica,"I'm glad you're here, we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony."
1,Rachel,Ohh
2,Ross,What's the matter?
3,Ross,You okay?
4,Rachel,"Yeah, it's just y'know"
5,Chandler,Monica said wedding.
6,Monica,"Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony."
7,Rachel,Oh!
8,Rachel,I would love to read a poem.
9,Chandler,Do you think you could get through a poem?
10,Rachel,It'll be a short one.
11,Monica,"Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading."
12,Rachel,Ohhh
13,Ross,Okay.
14,Ross,"Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too."
15,Chandler,Too?
16,Ross,"Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys."
17,Monica,Do you mind telling us what it is?
18,Ross,"Sorry, I'm kinda keeping this one on the Q.T."
19,Chandler,"Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking."
20,Joey,Hey!
21,Joey,"So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and"
22,Monica,What is DOOL?
23,Joey,Days Of Our Lives.
24,Joey,"Anyway, you're not gonna believe it!"
25,Joey,My character is coming out of his coma!
26,Chandler,That's great!
27,Joey,"And-and-and not only that, I'm gettin' a new brain!"
28,Chandler,So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
29,Rachel,"Wait, what do you mean you're getting a new brain?"
30,Joey,"Oh well, they're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body."
31,Ross,What?
32,Ross,A brain transplant?
33,Joey,"Yes, it's a highly controversial procedure."
34,Ross,It's ridiculous!
35,Joey,"Well, I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months."
36,Ross,"It's winter, they are fewer people on the street."
37,Monica,Who are they killing off?
38,Joey,"Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart."
39,Joey,Rachel and
40,Monica,Noo!
41,Monica,She's my favorite character on DOOL.
42,Joey,Nice.
43,Rachel,"She is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces, I mean I don't think I've ever seen her finish a beverage."
44,Monica,And the way she slaps all the time!
45,Rachel,Oh!
46,Monica,Wouldn't you love to do it just once?
47,Chandler,Don't do it.
48,Rachel,"Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress."
49,Joey,"Oh, tell me about it."
50,Joey,"And she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes."
51,Ross,"Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the ""brain transplant,"" you are going to be her?"
52,Joey,"Yes, but in Drake Remoray's body."
53,Joey,Why is this so hard for you to get?
54,Joey,I thought you were a scientist!
55,Joey,Opening Credits
56,Phoebe,"Rach, so, that guy there."
57,Phoebe,Straight or gay?
58,Rachel,"Well, I'd have to say gay."
59,Phoebe,Yeah?
60,Phoebe,Why?
61,Rachel,Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
62,Phoebe,Oh no not that guy there.
63,Phoebe,That guy right there.
64,Rachel,Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
65,Phoebe,Ohh knockers will help us figure it out.
66,Rachel,"All right, straight, and not subtle."
67,Phoebe,"Ohh, he left his cell phone."
68,Rachel,"Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found."
69,Phoebe,Or we could use it to call China.
70,Phoebe,See how those guys are doing.
71,Rachel,"What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love."
72,Rachel,I mean wouldn't that be a great story?
73,Rachel,Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
74,Phoebe,Yeah That does sound great.
75,Phoebe,I'm going to get the phone.
76,Rachel,What?
77,Rachel,Wait!
78,Rachel,Whywhy do you get the story?
79,Phoebe,I don't know.
80,Phoebe,I haven't been out on a date in so long.
81,Rachel,"Phoebe, you had a date three days ago."
82,Phoebe,That wasn't a date!
83,Phoebe,"That was, that was just friends getting together having sex."
84,Rachel,Okay.
85,Rachel,"Okay, see?"
86,Rachel,I get the phone.
87,Phoebe,No way!
88,Phoebe,No way!
89,Phoebe,You just broke with Tag a week ago.
90,Rachel,Yeah!
91,Rachel,"And until now, I didn't think I'd love again."
92,Phoebe,Nice try.
93,Rachel,Oh hey-hey wait!
94,Rachel,How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
95,Phoebe,I don't know.
96,Rachel,"Well umm, maybe we could uhh  Ah-ha!"
97,Rachel,Too slow!
98,Phoebe,Ah-ha!
99,Phoebe,Too cocky!
100,Joey,That was a great scene!
101,Joey,And-and-and that slap looks so real!
102,Joey,How do you do that?
103,Joey,"Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are."
104,Joey,Say what?
105,Joey,No.
106,Joey,"No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday."
107,Joey,I-I'm the guy in the coma!
108,Joey,"An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me"
109,Joey,I don't know.
110,Joey,Why?
111,Joey,Did you hear something?
112,Joey,"Oh uh, one of the writers."
113,Joey,Umm
114,Joey,Okay.
115,Joey,Ms. Monroe  Oh there you go.
116,Rachel,No Phoebe!
117,Rachel,You cannot get the phone that way; that's not fair!
118,Rachel,"Okay look, I have an idea."
119,Rachel,"Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him."
120,Rachel,And then whoever does gets the phone.
121,Phoebe,"Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone."
122,Rachel,I don't think so.
123,Phoebe,"Fine all right, but I'd bet you'd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet."
124,Rachel,"All right, first name on the speed dial is mom."
125,Phoebe,"Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide."
126,Rachel,"Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin."
127,Phoebe,Did I use that already today?
128,Phoebe,I'm sorry.
129,Rachel,Yes okay.
130,Rachel,Well now see this isn't telling us anything.
131,Rachel,Joe.
132,Rachel,Carlos.
133,Rachel,Peter.
134,Rachel,Ooh!
135,Rachel,Peter Luger!
136,Rachel,T hat's a steak house!
137,Phoebe,"Okay, a meat eater."
138,Phoebe,"Fine, that's one for you."
139,Rachel,"Oh, I win!"
140,Rachel,He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
141,Phoebe,So you don't know that's Barney's the store!
142,Phoebe,"That can be y'know his friend's house, or a bar."
143,Phoebe,Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial?
144,Rachel,His new girlfriend!
145,Monica,What is that?
146,Chandler,I think it's the dying cat parade.
147,Monica,It sounds like it's coming from across the street.
148,Chandler,Oh my God!
149,Monica,What?
150,Chandler,Y'know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?!
151,Chandler,"He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, ""You're half Scottish right?"""
152,Monica,Nooo!
153,Chandler,Yes!!
154,Chandler,Commercial Break
155,Monica,"No, there is no way!"
156,Monica,It can not be Ross!
157,Monica,Unbelievable!
158,Monica,Why is your family Scottish?
159,Chandler,Why is your family Ross?
160,Monica,He cannot play at our wedding!
161,Monica,I mean everyone will leave!
162,Monica,"I mean come on, that is just noise!"
163,Monica,It's not even a song!
164,Chandler,"If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang."
165,Rachel,Hi Pheebs!
166,Phoebe,Hi!
167,Rachel,How are ya?
168,Phoebe,Good.
169,Rachel,"Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy's cell phone?"
170,Phoebe,Yeah.
171,Rachel,And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
172,Phoebe,Yeah!
173,Rachel,And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?
174,Phoebe,"Ooh, now you lost me."
175,Rachel,You stole the phone!
176,Phoebe,No I didn't!
177,Rachel,No?
178,Rachel,"So you're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?"
179,Phoebe,No.
180,Rachel,"Umm, okay."
181,Rachel,"But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag."
182,Rachel,"Oh, it does work!"
183,Rachel,Phoebe!
184,Phoebe,That is a different phone.
185,Rachel,Oh is it?!
186,Rachel,"Uhh, hello?"
187,Rachel,"Yes hi, is Rachel there?"
188,Rachel,"Yes she is, just one moment please."
189,Rachel,It's for me!
190,Phoebe,That is damning evidence.
191,Rachel,Oh my God!
192,Rachel,I bet that's him.
193,Rachel,My digital fairy tale is about to begin.
194,Rachel,I wonder how I should be?
195,Rachel,Should I be uh  Hello?
196,Rachel,Or should I be  Hi!
197,Rachel,It's Rach  Would you stop doing that?
198,Phoebe,Hello?
199,Phoebe,"Yes, I'm the one who found your phone."
200,Rachel,Phoebe!

202,Phoebe,Shhh!
203,Phoebe,I'm on a call!
204,Phoebe,"Umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say"
205,Rachel,You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
206,Phoebe,Oh?
207,Phoebe,And how will you know what time to come over?
208,Rachel,You just said it!
209,Phoebe,Oh.
210,Phoebe,"Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would justbe alone y'know to think about my mom and her suicide."
211,Rachel,Oh Phoebe!
212,Phoebe,What?!
213,Phoebe,That's the first time today!
214,Rachel,Ohh!
215,Joey,So you like the nachos uh?

217,Joey,See you in 2003.
218,Joey,I'm so sorry.
219,Joey,"Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show."
220,Joey,No I mean it!
221,Joey,I can't believe they would do this to you!
222,Joey,And to your fans!
223,Joey,I mean they are going to be devastated!
224,Joey,Heart broken!
225,Joey,They love you so much!
226,Joey,Joey.
227,Joey,"Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-yel-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I'm really nervous about-about being you."
228,Joey,Y'know if you can help me capture the essence of the character.
229,Joey,Y'know?
230,Joey,Help me keep Jessica alive.
231,Joey,Please?
232,Joey,Oh that's great!
233,Joey,Oh thank you so much!

237,Joey,"Ever!!"""
238,Joey,Yeah.
239,Joey,I can do an English accent?!
240,Joey,That baby's going on my resume!
241,Chandler,"Well, I feel like a snack!"
242,Monica,Do you want some shortbread?
243,Monica,Eh that's Scottish like you are.
244,Chandler,Oh no thanks.
245,Chandler,I don't like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
246,Ross,What?
247,Chandler,Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland byVikings.
248,Chandler,"Anyway, lots of bad memories."
249,Ross,"Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots."
250,Monica,No!
251,Monica,No-no they're not.
252,Monica,They're still very angry!
253,Monica,But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish.
254,Monica,You know what the Swedish people are famous for?
255,Monica,Sitting down and being quiet.
256,Ross,Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more
257,Monica,You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!
258,Ross,How did you know about that?
259,Chandler,We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
260,Ross,Were you the ones called the cops?
261,Chandler,That's not really important right now.
262,Chandler,"What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding."
263,Ross,Why not?
264,Chandler,Because we hate them.
265,Ross,Come on that's not fair!
266,Ross,I mean you haven't even heard me play!
267,Chandler,We have heard you play.
268,Ross,"No, you've heard my practice."
269,Ross,Okay?
270,Ross,Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want.
271,Ross,And I'm not going to tell you what song I'm gonna play either.
272,Ross,"But uh, let's just say when it's over I'll bet there will be a we bit o' celebration."
273,Joey,Okay!
274,Joey,All right!
275,Joey,Okay.
276,Joey,Okay.
277,Joey,Oh wellHey-hey!
278,Joey,"Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing."
279,Joey,Y'know?
280,Joey,"It'll-it'll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters."
281,Joey,You're so talented.
282,Joey,Hey that's not true!
283,Joey,"Look at uh, look at Angela LansbAngelina Jolie!"
284,Joey,Like-like what?
285,Joey,Wow!
286,Joey,"Oh hey come on, don't-don't-don't do this!"
287,Joey,"Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay?"
288,Joey,"Now when I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, ""Boy, she-she is a great actress!"""
289,Joey,"Uh but-but, I am also thinking, ""She is hot!"""
290,Joey,You own the room.
291,Joey,We should probably get-get uh
292,Joey,"Yeah-yeah, I noticed that!"
293,Joey,Is that cause she's so passionate?
294,Joey,Yeah!
295,Joey,Okay.

312,Phoebe,"Could you-could you umm, give us one second?"
313,Rachel,We'll be right back sir.
314,Phoebe,Wh-what do we do?
315,Rachel,I don't know!
316,Phoebe,Can you believe this?
317,Phoebe,We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
318,Rachel,I know!
319,Rachel,What?
320,Phoebe,"Hmm, they just don't make em like that anymore!"
321,Rachel,"No-no they do but, you just have to wait."
322,Phoebe,"Rachel, listenI mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one."

352,Monica,Would you slap me right here in the face?

370,Joey,They never send the script!
371,Joey,"Well no, I'm just in a coma."
372,Joey,This must mean I have lines!
373,Joey,Oh
374,Joey,"Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence."
375,Joey,"Yeah well, I'm guessing after this she's not going to be crazy about electricity either."
376,Ross,now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
377,Rachel,I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
378,Ross,Do you wanna start telling secrets?
379,Rachel,No!
380,Ross,"Now umm, remember I'm still learning."
381,Ross,"One, two, three, four!"
382,Ross,You know the song!

398,Joey,That's a really long time.
399,Joey,"Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first."
400,Joey,"And I just got what you meant againThat isI tell ya, that is a tricky one!"
401,Joey,Good luck.
402,Ross,You know the song!

404,Phoebe,Eeee!!!
405,Phoebe,Eee!!
406,Phoebe,Eee!!
407,Phoebe,and Chandler  are laughing.
408,Phoebe,That then causes Lisa and Jennifer come out of character and start laughing hysterically.
409,Phoebe,And that finally causes David Schwimmer to come out of character and start laughing as well.
410,Phoebe,Matthew decides to sing along now as well.)
411,Phoebe,Matthew
