,Person,Said
0,Ross,That commercial always makes me so sad.
1,Joey,"Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK."
2,Ross,I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
3,Phoebe,"I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin."
4,Monica,And the fact that they're both monkeys.
5,Ross,"Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away."
6,Rachel,"Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight."
7,Rachel,"I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding."
8,Ross,"Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it."
9,Chandler,"Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny."
10,Chandler,When I did it to my boss's hat.
11,Chandler,all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
12,Chandler,OPENING TITLES
13,Joey,"Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got."
14,Chandler,Rhythm?
15,Joey,"No, my first fan mail."
16,Monica,"'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.'"
17,Monica,Gosh.
18,Monica,"'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.'"
19,Monica,"Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'"
20,Rachel,"Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married."
21,Monica,"This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment."
22,Monica,"There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building."
23,Joey,"Oh my god, I got my very own stalker."
24,Ross,Hey guys.
25,Phoebe,"Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?"
26,Ross,"Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel."
27,Chandler,"You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion."
28,Rachel,"Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again."
29,Phoebe,"Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny."
30,Phoebe,"So everyone just laugh, now."
31,Phoebe,"I know, I know."
32,Phoebe,Hello.
33,Phoebe,Hi Rob Dohnen.
34,Phoebe,"Oh, wow."
35,Phoebe,"Oh, I would love to have kids."
36,Phoebe,"you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them."
37,Joey,"Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?"
38,Chandler,Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.
39,Chandler,Hello.
40,Joey,"Ah, the stalker."
41,Chandler,"Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea."
42,Chandler,"We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon."
43,Joey,Let's get out of here.
44,Chandler,The one time they're not home.
45,Joey,"OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met."
46,Chandler,That's how radio stars escape stalkers.
47,Joey,She's comin'.
48,Joey,"Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die."
49,Joey,Ready?
50,Chandler,"Wait, wait, wait."
51,Joey,Erica.
52,Ross,"Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year."
53,Ross,"He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel."
54,Ross,"Oh my God, what happened?"
55,Ross,I can't believe this.
56,Ross,"Well, ya know, someone should have called me."
57,Ross,Zoo dollars?
58,Phoebe,I know.
59,Monica,I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker.
60,Monica,"What i-, what is she like."
61,Chandler,"Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?"
62,Chandler,RACHEL AND
63,Monica,Yeah.
64,Chandler,"Well, she looks the exact opposite of that."
65,Rachel,And she's not crazy?
66,Chandler,"Oh no no no, she's a total wack job."
67,Chandler,"Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore."
68,Rachel,Oh my God.
69,Monica,"Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her?"
70,Monica,He can not persue this.
71,Chandler,"Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person."
72,Chandler,"I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love?"
73,Chandler,What're you lookin' at me for?
74,Chandler,He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
75,Phoebe,"No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous."
76,Phoebe,"So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear."
77,Phoebe,"I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups."
78,Phoebe,"Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen."
79,Phoebe,This is a huge responsibility.
80,Phoebe,What?
81,Phoebe,Are you gonna kiss me?
82,Ross,I was thinkin' about it.
83,Phoebe,"OK.  OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes."
84,Phoebe,"Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe"
85,Phoebe,"OK, um, I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK.  Now, grandma's a person who everyone likes, she bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike."
86,Phoebe,"But lately she hasn't been coming to dinner, And last time you saw her she looked so much thinner."
87,Phoebe,"Now, your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru, but the truth is she died and some day you will too."
88,Phoebe,La-la-la la la-la-la la la-la-la la...
89,Joey,Yeah it is.
90,Joey,what?
91,Joey,"Yeah, that was a tricky one."
92,Joey,"In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites."
93,Joey,No one.
94,Joey,"Good, otherwise my watch would fall off."
95,Joey,"Alright, just one."
96,Joey,"Wow, you're good at that."
97,Ross,"Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way."
98,Ross,"But, um, zoo dollars?"
99,Joey,"Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage."
100,Joey,"Alright, look, I got to tell you something."
101,Joey,But that's what...
102,Joey,Hey I-
103,Joey,"That's it, just hey."
104,Joey,"Like at the end of a dance, HEY!"
105,Joey,Hey.
106,Joey,He-hey.
107,Phoebe,There'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you.
108,Phoebe,But don't.
109,Phoebe,"Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody That's another thing that you don't wanna do."
110,Monica,Excellent!
111,Chandler,Very informative!
112,Rachel,Not at all inappropriate!
113,Phoebe,Thank you for coming everybody.
114,Phoebe,There're cookies in the back.
115,Phoebe,"Yay, I rock."
116,Phoebe,But.
117,Phoebe,I sense these things.
118,Phoebe,It was either but or butter.
119,Phoebe,I can do that.
120,Phoebe,Yeah.
121,Phoebe,Thinkin' about it.
122,Ross,"Buddy, my monkey?"
123,Ross,Oh my God.
124,Ross,But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.
125,Ross,"That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me."
126,Ross,That guy Lipson?
127,Ross,"No, I, I only know Lipson."
128,Ross,"Buddy, my monkey, my monkey."
129,Ross,Of course.
130,Ross,This is unbelievable.
131,Ross,Are you trying to get me to bribe you?
132,Ross,But you already told me everything.
133,Ross,"Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey."
134,Rachel,"Well, so what're you gonna do?"
135,Ross,"Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is."
136,Chandler,That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.
137,Phoebe,"OK, hi again."
138,Phoebe,Today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals.
139,Phoebe,"Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo, Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo."
140,Phoebe,"Then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up, And that's how we get hamburgers."
141,Phoebe,"Nooowww, chickens!"
142,Ross,"Well, there goes my whole belief system."
143,Joey,"Oh my God, quick turn off the TV."
144,Rachel,"No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens."
145,Joey,"Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out."
146,Rachel,"Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?"
147,Monica,"Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon."
148,Joey,"Hey Erica, c'mon in."
149,Joey,"Right, they uh, they choppered me in."
150,Joey,What's up?
151,Joey,Who?
152,Joey,"It's not what you think, that was..."
153,Joey,"Alright look, that's it."
154,Joey,"I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright."
155,Joey,"Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK."
156,Joey,"I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor."
157,Joey,I just pretend to be a doctor.
158,Joey,Somebody wanna help me out here?
159,Rachel,"Oh, I know, I know."
160,Joey,'Cause it's a television show.

162,Ross,"That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin."
163,Rachel,"Yes, yes it is true."
164,Rachel,"And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me."
165,Monica,"And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't."
166,Chandler,"And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard."
167,Joey,"Yes, I'm afraid it is."
168,Joey,You deserve much better than me Erica.
169,Joey,"You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with."
170,Joey,"Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you."

193,Phoebe,la la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
194,Ross,"This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year."

237,Monica,"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God."
238,Rachel,What what what what?
239,Monica,Jean-Claude Van Damme.
240,Monica,"I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot."

256,Rachel,VAN
257,Rachel,"I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute?"
258,Rachel,"OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here."
259,Rachel,"Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute."
260,Rachel,So what should I tell her?
261,Rachel,VAN
262,Chandler,"No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows."
263,Chandler,OK that's not what he was doing.
264,Chandler,"Alright, he was looking for his bus money."
265,Chandler,"Oh uh, o, OK."
266,Chandler,"Well, uh, let's try one more."
267,Chandler,"there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock."
268,Chandler,No one was around to hear that?
269,Monica,So what'd he say?
270,Rachel,"Agh, what a jerk."
271,Rachel,I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out.
272,Rachel,"I mean, naturally, you know, I said no."
273,Monica,"Well, thanks anyway."
274,Rachel,"He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking."
275,Monica,"Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can."
276,Monica,Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...
277,Rachel,"Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight."
278,Rachel,Thank you.
279,Rachel,And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.
280,Joey,"Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of."
281,Joey,"no guys around, huh."
282,Rachel,Does anybody need anything?
283,Monica,"Oh, I'll have an espresso."
284,Monica,"Oh acutally, I'll get it."
285,Monica,"If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself."
286,Rachel,That is so unfair.
287,Phoebe,I know.
288,Phoebe,"Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme."
289,Ross,"Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer."
290,Ross,He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.
291,Joey,You're blowin' me off for a monkey?
292,Ross,"Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday."
293,Joey,"Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons."
294,Chandler,"Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done."
295,Phoebe,Stick a fork what?
296,Chandler,"Like, when you're cooking a steak."
297,Phoebe,"Oh, OK, I don't eat meat."
298,Chandler,"Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?"
299,Phoebe,"Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell."
300,Chandler,"OK, then, eat me, I'm done."
301,Chandler,I've met the perfect woman.
302,Chandler,"OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'"
303,Monica,What did you say?
304,Chandler,"Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'."
305,Chandler,"I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?"
306,Phoebe,"Oh, you just know."
307,Chandler,"Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops."
308,Chandler,"Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there."
309,Chandler,You want me to wear your panties?
310,Chandler,"Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?."
311,Chandler,You're swell.
312,Ross,"OK, got the music, got the dinner."

326,Rachel,"Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified."
327,Rachel,"She gave me the green light, I did nothing but-."
328,Rachel,Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?
329,Phoebe,"Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share..."
330,Monica,"Ya know, you had no right to go out with him."
331,Rachel,That is the most ridiculous.
332,Monica,You sold me out.
333,Rachel,I did not sell you out.
334,Monica,Yes you did.
335,Monica,Absolutely.
336,Rachel,Would you let me talk.
