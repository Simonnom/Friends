27,Phoebe,"Oh, I don't know."
28,Phoebe,"Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace."
29,Rachel,What!
30,Monica,"Wait a minute, who told you?"
31,Monica,You are dead meat.
32,Chandler,I didn't know it was a big secret.
33,Monica,"Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple."
34,Phoebe,You have a third nipple?
35,Chandler,You bitch.
36,Ross,"Whip it out, whip it out."
37,Chandler,"C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless."
38,Rachel,"Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?"
39,Joey,I can't believe you.
40,Joey,You told me it was a nubbin.
41,Ross,"Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?"
42,Joey,"I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was."
43,Joey,Let me see it again.
44,Chandler,Joey was in a porno movie.
45,Chandler,"If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me."
46,Ross,You were in a porno?
47,Joey,"Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK."
48,Joey,But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.
49,Monica,That is wild.
50,Ross,So what's it shaped like?
51,Phoebe,"Yeah, is there a hair on it?"
52,Joey,What happens if you flick it?
53,Ross,"So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?"
54,Chandler,"Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia."
55,Chandler,Huh?
56,Chandler,"Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?"
57,Ross,"You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?"
58,Rachel,"Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special."
59,Monica,"Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did."
60,Monica,But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.
61,Rachel,"Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it."

70,Monica,"I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again."
71,Phoebe,"OK, no."
72,Phoebe,For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me.
73,Phoebe,"OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband."
74,Ross,"Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk."
75,Ross,"Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?"
76,Chandler,"Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing."

228,Ross,"Wha, uhh, what?"
229,Rachel,"Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from."
230,Ross,"OK, now I'm nervous."
231,Rachel,Maybe you should put it off.
232,Ross,"No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy."

236,Ross,"What, it's not your fault."
237,Rachel,"Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough."
238,Rachel,"I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing."
239,Rachel,"I mean, women really like that."
240,Ross,Really?
241,Rachel,"Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen."
242,Ross,Uh-huh.
243,Rachel,"And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you."
244,Rachel,"And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening."
