11,Joey,"YeahHey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl."
12,Joey,"And hey listen, could you do me a favor?"
13,Joey,When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
14,Rachel,Why?!

16,Rachel,Are you kidding?
17,Joey,"Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork."
18,Joey,"Tell her uh, I'm a lonerNo!"

89,Monica,I mean it won't be so bad.
90,Chandler,What do you think she's just gonna sit there quietly?
91,Chandler,You don't think she's gonna want to make a toast?
92,Chandler,You don't think she's gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?
93,Monica,"Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?"
94,Chandler,Y'know what?
95,Chandler,It's gonna be okay.

97,Chandler,She's probably not gonna even want to come.
98,Monica,Really?
99,Chandler,No!
100,Chandler,That was a lie!
101,Chandler,See how easy that was?
102,Monica,So-so you would've just lied?
103,Chandler,Yes!

209,Ross,The Head
210,Ross,"Well, fine."

222,Joey,No!
223,Joey,No!
224,Joey,You guys were totally right!
225,Joey,This is so much better than the first time we went out.
226,Joey,Y'know?
227,Joey,"That was so awkward, we were really nervous."
228,Phoebe,Didn't you sleep together?
229,Joey,Yeah that really calms me down.
230,Joey,And!
231,Joey,We have so much in common!

239,Monica,Is that all?
240,Chandler,"Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding."
241,Chandler,"Um, it's going to be a small ceremony."
242,Chandler,"Uh, tiny!"
243,Chandler,We're not even sure why we're having it.
244,Monica,It's actually going to be just family.
245,Joey,How can you say that?!
246,Joey,The Mets have no closer!
247,Joey,What about Game 1 of the Series?
248,Joey,You shut up!
249,Joey,I love arguing with her.
250,Joey,I'll be right back.
251,Rachel,So how's it goin' with Joey?
252,Rachel,Okay?
253,Rachel,"Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please?"
254,Rachel,I mean tell me that you like him.
255,Rachel,But you said that you liked him!
256,Rachel,I mean what happened?!
257,Rachel,Did ya just change your mind?
258,Phoebe,Then change it back!
259,Phoebe,No spark?
260,Phoebe,Didn't you sleep together?
261,Rachel,"Ugh, tramp!"
262,Phoebe,Does Joey have any idea?
263,Phoebe,"Yeah, you mean like that you're kind of a loner."
264,Phoebe,"Yeah, and maybe that you're a real"
265,Phoebe,"Oh well, I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak."
266,Joey,Hey!
267,Joey,You wanna go?
268,Joey,Okay.
269,Joey,See you guys later.
270,Rachel,"Yeah, see ya."
271,Joey,"Hey, thank you so much."
272,Rachel,Wow.
273,Rachel,"Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here."
274,Phoebe,"No, just a regular old flying dwarf."
275,Ross,Yes?
276,Ross,Yes?!
277,Ross,How can I help you?
278,Ross,"Oh-oh, you're-you're fellow scholars."
279,Ross,"What exactly were you looking for, hmm?"
280,Ross,"Perhaps,  perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings on the Smiledon Californicus?"
281,Ross,Ah AhGet out of here!
282,Ross,"Uh, meeting someone?"
283,Ross,Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion's views on evolution?
284,Ross,I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
285,Ross,"I'm a professor here uh, RossGeller."
286,Ross,Yes!
287,Ross,You're the person who checked out my book?
288,Ross,"Well I uh, I skipped forth grade."
289,Ross,I am veryvery sorry.
290,Joey,Hey!
291,Phoebe,Hey!
292,Rachel,Hi!
293,Phoebe,"So how was, how was your date?"
294,Joey,"Oh, it was great!"
295,Joey,I mean we walked all around the village.
296,Joey,"We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still And guess what, I'm thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts."
297,Phoebe,Oh really?
298,Phoebe,She said she wants to go away with you?
299,Joey,No-no-no-no-no!
300,Joey,"It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while."
301,Joey,Phoebe and
302,Rachel,"Oh no, yeah."
303,Rachel,"Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay?"
304,Rachel,"Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she's not lookin' for a serious relationship."
305,Joey,Where are you gettin' this?
306,Rachel,"Well, she told me."
307,Rachel,She said she's kinda a loner.
308,Joey,Oh.
309,Joey,Oh.
310,Rachel,Joey
311,Joey,"No hey Rach, it's cool okay?"
312,Joey,Y'know I'm a loner too!
313,Joey,Right?
314,Phoebe,"Hey Joey, y'know what?"
315,Phoebe,You are way to good for her.
316,Rachel,Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell em you're not looking for a relationship.
317,Joey,No!
318,Joey,No.
319,Joey,"Don't do that, just next time make sure she really likes me."
320,Rachel,Well that too.
321,Rachel,Joey?
322,Joey,Yeah?
323,Rachel,Do you want some pancakes?
324,Joey,Finally!
325,Monica,What are we gonna do?
326,Chandler,I say we go with Careless Whisper.
327,Chandler,Did she see us yet?
328,Chandler,Did she see us?
329,Monica,"Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?"
330,Monica,Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren't they?
331,Chandler,Aren't you just a tinsy bit curious?
332,Monica,"Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom."
333,Monica,We'll justwe'll just let her stay.
334,Chandler,"No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!"
335,Monica,Kinda like your Barca lounger.
336,Chandler,Is that what you're thinking about right now?
337,Monica,I never stop thinking about it.
338,Chandler,"Janice, I'm sorry but umm, you can't stay here tonight."
339,Chandler,Honestly?
340,Chandler,Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity.
341,Chandler,"Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not."
342,Monica,Oh my God!
343,Monica,Oh my God!
344,Monica,You have to go!
345,Monica,Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
346,Chandler,Say again?
347,Monica,That's right.
348,Monica,That's right.
349,Monica,And that is why you can't stay here tonight.
350,Monica,And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
351,Chandler,"Feelings, such strong feelings."
352,Monica,"I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can."
353,Ross,"Don't sweat it, I've got this section covered."
354,Ross,"Yeah, in fact I've got this little baby  to shine in people's eyeOkay, see you later."
355,Chandler,I just wanted to show Monica your book.
356,Chandler,End
