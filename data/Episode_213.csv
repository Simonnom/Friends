51,Ross,"And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field."
52,Chandler,What are you crazy?
53,Chandler,That's a baby!
54,Joey,He should take the sack?
55,Ross,"Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right?"
56,Ross,"Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up."
57,Ross,"See I, I am so not ready to be a father."
58,Chandler,"Hey, you're gonna be fine."
59,Chandler,"You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America."
60,Chandler,You're gonna make a great dad.

76,Chandler,So what're you gonna do?
77,Joey,What can I do?
78,Joey,"Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula."
79,Chandler,And your friend Phoebe?
80,Joey,"Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand."
81,Joey,"I mean, wouldn't you guys?"
82,Chandler,"Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit."
