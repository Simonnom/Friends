10,Monica,"Oh, by the way."
11,Monica,Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year?
12,Ross,"Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?"
13,Monica,"Yeah, I'd really like to."
14,Ross,"Okay, hopefully this time mom won't boo you."

16,Monica,"Every year Ross makes the toast, and it's always really moving, and always makes them cry."
17,Monica,Well this year I'm going to make them cry.
18,Chandler,And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
19,Monica,No!
20,Monica,Really!
21,Monica,"Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, ""God, your brother."""
22,Monica,Know what they'll say this year?
23,Monica,"""God, you"""
24,Joey,"Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying."

39,Monica,"The good stuff, huh?"
40,Rachel,Hi!
41,Ross,Hey!
42,Joey,Hey!
43,Monica,You got a present for my parents.
44,Monica,That's so sweet.
45,Joey,"Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35th wedding anniversary, I had a star named after them."
46,Ross,Aww that is so cool.
47,Joey,And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.
48,Rachel,"Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?"
49,Chandler,"Yeah, sure."
50,Chandler,What do you need?
51,Chandler,"We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt,  and I think my testacles may be in here too."
52,Ross,Aww!
53,Ross,Chi-Chi!
54,Ross,"Oh, I loved this dog!"
55,Ross,Y'know Monica couldn't get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.
56,Monica,What?
57,Ross,You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!
58,Phoebe,Hey!
59,Phoebe,"Everybody, this is Parker, Parker this is"
60,Chandler,Ha!
61,Ross,"Ah, actually, I'm sorry we-we probably should get going."
62,Rachel,"I, uh, think you already are."
63,Monica,That's my old dog.
64,Monica,He passed away years ago.
65,Monica,It's out on the island.
66,Monica,It's in Massapequa.
67,Ross,"Well, there is an Arby's in the shape of a tee-pee."
68,Monica,"Okay, I got my note cards."
69,Monica,Do you got the presents?
70,Chandler,Yeah.
71,Monica,And I've got the car keys.
72,Monica,Yeah.
73,Ross,"So uh, he seems like a nice guy."
74,Rachel,"Yeah, yeah I like him a lot."
75,Ross,Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?
76,Rachel,"Yeah, otherwise I'm not going."
77,Ross,Hi!
78,Ross,Hey mom.
79,Rachel,This is such a great party!
80,Rachel,35 years.
81,Rachel,"Very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?"
82,Rachel,Mrs.
83,Ross,"That's a good question, dad."
84,Ross,That's a good question
85,Rachel,Hmmm.
86,Rachel,Thank youwe're so excited
87,Ross,WhaWhat?
88,Ross,Mrs.
89,Rachel,What?!
90,Rachel,Mrs.
91,Ross,Dad so what we have to pretend that we're married?
92,Ross,Mr.
93,Ross,Can you believe that?
94,Rachel,"Yeah, if you're going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area."
95,Ross,"No, us having to lie about being married."
96,Rachel,"No, I know I don't either, but ya know what, it's their party, and it's just one night."
97,Rachel,And we don't even have to lie; we just won't say anything.
98,Rachel,"If it comes up again, we'll justsmile."
99,Rachel,We'll nod along.
100,Ross,"Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan Aunt"
101,Rachel,Hmmmm.
102,Rachel,Uncle
103,Rachel,Oh Aunt
104,Rachel,Unbelievable!
105,Ross,We love marriage!
106,Ross,Aunt
107,Ross,Hey
108,Phoebe,Hey!
109,Chandler,I don't think the flash went off.
110,Phoebe,I'll go with you
111,Chandler,Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.
112,Joey,"I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don't want him complimenting my thing."
113,Ross,I'm so we weren't in the car!
114,Ross,Did he ever let up?
115,Monica,He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.
116,Ross,This room!
117,Ross,This night!
118,Ross,That waiter!
119,Ross,His shoes!
120,Ross,I must take a mental picture!
121,Ross,Ooh sorry
122,Phoebe,Were you guys making fun of Parker?
123,Ross,"That depends, how much did you hear?"
124,Phoebe,"So, he a little enthusiastic, what's wrong with that?"
125,Monica,"It's just that, it's so much."
126,Phoebe,"Well, so what I like him!"
127,Phoebe,Do I make fun of the people you've dated?
128,Phoebe,"Tag, Janice, Mona?"
129,Phoebe,"No, because friends don't do that."
130,Phoebe,"But, do you want my opinion?"
131,Phoebe,Do you want it?
132,Phoebe,"Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the who's who of human crap."
133,Monica,I feel terrible.
134,Joey,I know
135,Ross,What was wrong with Mona?
136,Ross,Commercial Break
137,Rachel,Open it!
138,Rachel,Open it!
139,Rachel,Open it!
140,Ross,Yeah baby!
141,Ross,"No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends."
142,Ross,It was a small wedding.
143,Rachel,But it was beautiful.
144,Rachel,"I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular."
145,Rachel,"On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang Isn't She Lovely as I walked down the aisle."
146,Rachel,"Yeah, Stevie's an old family friend."
147,Rachel,So would I.
148,Rachel,You wouldn't think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.
149,Ross,Would you excuse us for a second?
150,Ross,Umm.
151,Ross,what are you doing?
152,Rachel,What?
153,Rachel,I'm not you.
154,Rachel,This may be the only wedding I ever have.
155,Rachel,I want it to be amazing.
156,Ross,"Okay, okay."
157,Ross,"Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley."
158,Rachel,"Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic."
159,Phoebe,"No, I'm fine."
160,Phoebe,I'm great.
161,Phoebe,I'm with you.
162,Phoebe,"Hm huh, yeah."
163,Phoebe,"No, that's not necessary."
164,Phoebe,"No, actually I don't eat"
165,Phoebe,"Okay, fine!"
166,Phoebe,Fine!
167,Phoebe,Mmmhmmmmm.
168,Phoebe,Why don't you just try one?
169,Chandler,What are you doin'?
170,Monica,Just going over my toast.
171,Monica,Those two will never know what hit em.
172,Monica,I can't wait.
173,Monica,They're going to be crying so hard.
174,Monica,They're going to be fighting for breath.
175,Chandler,"Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could ."
176,Rachel,"And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns."
177,Rachel,"Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it."
178,Rachel,Aunt
179,Rachel,"Well, I don't know about that, but some said that I looked like a floating angel."
180,Rachel,Oh yeah.
181,Rachel,That's a great story.
182,Ross,"Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium."
183,Ross,That's-that's where we had our first date.
184,Ross,"Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower Aunt"
185,Rachel,Shhh!
186,Rachel,I want to hear the rest!
187,Ross,"Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down."
188,Ross,"And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words ""Will you marry me?"""
189,Rachel,"And the ring, was the size of my fist !"
190,Joey,"Yeah uh, Phoebe!"
191,Joey,"Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay?"
192,Joey,We were being jerks.
193,Joey,Parker's a nice guy and I'd like to get to know him.
194,Phoebe,Then you better do it now.
195,Joey,Why?
196,Phoebe,Because I'm going to kill him
197,Joey,What-what?
198,Phoebe,You guys were right.
199,Phoebe,He's just too excited abouteverything.
200,Phoebe,"I mean I'm all for living life, but this is the Geller's 35th anniversary."
201,Phoebe,Okay?
202,Phoebe,Let's call a spade a spade this party stinks.
203,Joey,I know I'm having the worst time.
204,Joey,"There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!"
205,Phoebe,Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?
206,Joey,"I guess it could've been, I didn't really look at it."
207,Joey,"Y'know, I just wiped it on Chandler's coat and got the hell out of there."
208,Phoebe,He's just such a great guy I'm so excited about him.
209,Joey,"Oh hey, you should be excited about him."
210,Joey,There's nothing wrong with him he's a good guy.
211,Phoebe,You think?
212,Joey,Yeah.
213,Joey,Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.
214,Phoebe,You're right.
215,Phoebe,"You're right, he's just embracing life."
216,Phoebe,We could all stand to be a little more like Parker.
217,Phoebe,You know what?
218,Phoebe,I am like him!
219,Phoebe,"I'm a sunny, positive person."
220,Joey,"Actually, you have a little bit of an edge."
221,Phoebe,What's that now?
222,Joey,Nothing
223,Phoebe,Oh look it's Parker!
224,Phoebe,Oooh I love it!
225,Phoebe,Are you kidding?
226,Phoebe,People acting like animals to music.
227,Phoebe,Come on!
228,Monica,Okay it's time for the toast!
229,Monica,"Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year I'm going to do it."
230,Monica,"No, no it's going to be great."
231,Monica,Really!
232,Monica,"Mom, Dad, when I got married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me."
233,Monica,For that and so many other things I want to say thank you.
234,Monica,"I know I probably don't say it enough, but I love you."
235,Monica,"When I look around this room, I'm-I'm saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us."
236,Monica,"Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she can't because she's dead."
237,Monica,As is our dog Chi-Chi.
238,Monica,I mean look how cute she is.
239,Monica,Was.
240,Monica,Do me a favor and pass this to my parents.
241,Monica,Remember she's dead.
242,Monica,"Okay, her and Nana, gone."
243,Monica,Wow!
244,Monica,Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in Terms of Endearment?
245,Monica,Didn't see that?
246,Monica,No movie fans?!
247,Monica,You want to hear something sad?
248,Monica,"The other day I was watching 60 Minutes these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love."
249,Monica,You people are made of stone!
250,Monica,Here's to mom and dad!
251,Monica,Whatever!
252,Monica,Mrs.
253,Ross,"Oh, no, Mom, it's just Monica this year."
254,Ross,Mrs.
255,Ross,"No, of course, Um Um, everybody?"
256,Ross,"Um, I-I just wanted to sayon behalf of my new bride, Rachel , and myself."
257,Ross,"Umm, that ifif in 35 years, we're half as happy as you guys are, we'll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world."
258,Ross,Mrs.
259,Phoebe,Can I get you something to drink?
260,Phoebe,Like a water and Valium?
261,Phoebe,Oh thank God.
262,Phoebe,Yeah?
263,Phoebe,I know!
264,Phoebe,I know!
265,Phoebe,Uh huh?
266,Phoebe,"Listen why don't we just um, sit and relax?"
267,Phoebe,You know just be with each other.
268,Phoebe,Quietly!
269,Phoebe,"Let's try something else, let's play a game."
270,Phoebe,Shocking!
271,Phoebe,Let's play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.
272,Phoebe,"But, let's play this one first."
273,Phoebe,And remember whoever talks first loses!
274,Phoebe,Oh my God!
275,Phoebe,Oh my God!
276,Phoebe,Wrong?
277,Phoebe,Really?
278,Phoebe,You know the word wrong.
279,Phoebe,Everything isn't perfect?
280,Phoebe,Everything isn't magical?
281,Phoebe,Everything isn't a glow with the light of a million fairies?
282,Phoebe,"They were just brake lights, Parker!"
283,Phoebe,You don't have to put a good spin on everything.
284,Phoebe,No!
285,Phoebe,I am a positive person.
286,Phoebe,"You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!"
287,Phoebe,Much less happy!
288,Phoebe,So long!
289,Phoebe,Don't let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out!
290,Phoebe,Uh huh.
291,Ross,"and then, we could've gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!"
292,Rachel,"Ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible."
293,Ross,But having a dove place the ring on your finger would've been no problem?
294,Rachel,It was really fun being married to you tonight.
295,Ross,Yeah!
296,Ross,And!
297,Ross,"And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I've ever made."
298,Rachel,"Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?"
299,Ross,Yeah.
300,Rachel,"That proposal, at the planetarium"
301,Ross,"I know, I know it was stupid."
302,Rachel,Are you kidding?!
303,Rachel,"With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars!"
304,Rachel,It wasreally wonderful!
305,Rachel,Did you just make that up?
306,Ross,"No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out."
307,Ross,"It's how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me."
308,Rachel,"Well, that would've been very hard to say no too."
309,Ross,"It's a good thing I didn't do it, because it sounds like it would've been a very expensive wedding."
310,Ross,"Okay, good night"
311,Rachel,Goodnight
312,Ross,Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn't get messed up?
313,Rachel,I will think about it.
314,Ross,That's all I'm askin'  Ending Credits
315,Monica,Okay that's it.
316,Monica,I give up.
317,Monica,"At mom and dad's 40th anniversary, you're the one giving the speech."
318,Ross,Y'know I don't understand why they didn't cry.
319,Ross,It was a beautiful speech.
320,Monica,"Oh, come on."
321,Ross,Hey!
322,Ross,"All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad!"
323,Ross,And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.
324,Ross,And what you said about Nana.
325,Ross,"Ohh, yeah she really would've wanted to be there."
326,Ross,And you know what?
327,Ross,I think she was.
328,Monica,"Oh good God, Ross!"
329,Monica,How the hell do you do it?
330,Monica,End
