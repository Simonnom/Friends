11,Chandler,I'm gonna miss being able to afford food.
12,Monica,"I'm sorry, they just, they just look so good!"
13,Monica,"And the saleswoman was looking at me like, ""Oh, these are way too expensive for you."""
14,Chandler,She had a point.

39,Phoebe,Okay!
40,Phoebe,"Okay, cause when-when he said, ""I can't wait to hear your first words,"" I thought, ""There's a trick."""

51,Rachel,"No, forget it!"
52,Rachel,No way!
53,Rachel,I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison.
54,Rachel,It is a waste.
55,Joey,"No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her."
56,Joey,"My youngest sister, Dina, she's really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, y'know, to give her some advice."
57,Rachel,I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors
58,Joey,"Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!"
59,Rachel,Really?!
60,Rachel,Oh my God!

74,Phoebe,Doesn't Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?
75,Ross,Yeah.
76,Ross,Why?
77,Phoebe,Sting has a son that goes there too!
78,Ross,Yeah I know; he's in Ben's class.
79,Phoebe,You knew this and you never said anything?!
80,Phoebe,With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?
81,Ross,Fine!
82,Ross,No more dinosaur stuff!
83,Ross,Can I talk about fossils?
84,Phoebe,"Sting's son, seven years old and there's a picture."
85,Ross,What are you reading?
86,Ross,The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?
87,Phoebe,"No, it's New York magazine."
88,Phoebe,It's an article about the best schools in the city.
89,Phoebe,So how well do you know Sting?
90,Ross,"Uh, I actually haven't even met him."
91,Phoebe,"Uh-huh, yeah that's too bad."
92,Phoebe,"I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but it's totally sold out."
93,Phoebe,I know!
94,Phoebe,Why don't you meet him and get tickets?!
95,Phoebe,If you get two I'll take you.
96,Ross,"Well actually, I'm picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he'll be there."
97,Phoebe,There you go!
98,Phoebe,"Oh, you are so lucky!"
99,Phoebe,You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow!
100,Phoebe,That's why you have kids!
101,Monica,Hey guys!
102,Chandler,Hey-hey.
103,Rachel,Hi Monica!
104,Monica,Hey.
105,Rachel,Hi boots.
106,Monica,See Chandler?
107,Monica,I'm getting a lot of use out of them already!
108,Monica,They're very practical.
109,Monica,"See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants"
110,Chandler,You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them.
111,Phoebe,Wow!
112,Phoebe,They're beautiful!
113,Rachel,Ahh
114,Monica,They hurt so much!
115,Phoebe,What?
116,Monica,The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!
117,Rachel,Well-well you can give them to me!
118,Rachel,I haven't felt my feet in years!
119,Monica,I can't!
120,Monica,"I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that I'd wear them all the time, I just can't give them away!"
121,Phoebe,Well then get your money back and return them!
122,Monica,I can't do that either!
123,Monica,The soles' are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.
124,Ross,Hey!
125,Chandler,Hey!
126,Ross,Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school
127,Chandler,I don't think you did a very thorough job!
128,Ross,I dropped him off at Carol's.
129,Ross,"Anyway, it turns out that I'm not going to be able to get those tickets though."
130,Phoebe,Oh no!
131,Phoebe,Why not?
132,Ross,Well it turns out that Ben and Sting's son do not get along.
133,Phoebe,How come?
134,Ross,"Apparently, Sting's son made fun of the fact that Ben's moms are lesbinims."
135,Phoebe,Wait!
136,Phoebe,But Ross if they don't get along then you should smooth things over.
137,Phoebe,Make them be friends.
138,Ross,"Phoebe, you can't force kids to be friends."
139,Phoebe,Sure you can!
140,Phoebe,"Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!"
141,Ross,Playpen?!
142,Ross,Ben's seven!
143,Phoebe,Your kid is seven?!
144,Phoebe,He's really small.
145,Phoebe,Please!
146,Phoebe,Please get the tickets!
147,Ross,"Look I'm sorry Pheebs, I can't do it."
148,Phoebe,Yes you can!
149,Phoebe,Sting says so himself!
150,Ross,What?
151,Phoebe,Rosssss can!

166,Joey,"Well, I'll let you two fashists get down to business."
167,Rachel,Okay.
168,Rachel,"All right Dina, well let's talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in."
169,Rachel,"Let's see, there's design, but you may need a whole other degree for that."
170,Rachel,"Uh, there's-there's sales, which is great because you get to travel"
171,Rachel,And there's marketing
172,Monica,Ahhhhhhhh!
173,Chandler,What's wrong?
174,Monica,Oh nothing I'm justjust was yawning.
175,Chandler,"Oh don't forget, my office holiday party is tonight."
176,Monica,"Honey, we don't really have to go to this thing tonight do we?"
177,Chandler,"Now sweetie, I know you don't like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots."
178,Chandler,See?
179,Chandler,Every cloud has asupple leather lining.
180,Monica,I-I don't-I don't think that I'm gonna wear the boots tonight.
181,Chandler,Why not?
182,Monica,"Well y'know, I'm just-I'm just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money."
183,Monica,Or!
184,Monica,Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!
185,Chandler,Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
186,Monica,"Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots don't really go with it."
187,Chandler,"You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!"
188,Monica,Fine!
189,Monica,"If you want me to wear the boots, I'll wear the boots."
190,Monica,"In fact, I'll go into my room right now and y'know try the outfit on."
191,Chandler,Okay.
192,Monica,Okay?
193,Monica,Ooo wee!

198,Joey,Hey!
199,Joey,It's my fashion girls!
200,Joey,What's wrong?
201,Rachel,"Honey, why don't you sit down?"
202,Rachel,Dina has something that she wants to tell you.
203,Joey,Oh.
204,Joey,"What's, what's going on?"
205,Joey,Is it mom?
206,Joey,Is she sick?
207,Joey,Is it dad's heart?
208,Joey,Is that a sandwich?
209,Joey,Is that a sandwich?
210,Rachel,Joeythere's something that youshould know.
211,Rachel,Dina?
212,Joey,What?
213,Rachel,Now!
214,Rachel,Give him the sandwich!
215,Rachel,Give him the sandwich!
216,Joey,Well obviously this is a mistake!

234,Phoebe,"Oh, there you are Ben!"
235,Phoebe,"Well, I heard you're having a problem with one of the boys in your class."
236,Phoebe,"And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay."
237,Phoebe,"Now umm, the boy's name is Sting's son."
238,Phoebe,"Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers."
239,Phoebe,Him you're friends with.
240,Phoebe,The

255,Phoebe,Yeah!
256,Phoebe,Let's do that!!
257,Phoebe,That-that sounds good.
258,Phoebe,"We should sit down and talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings."
259,Phoebe,"Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?"
260,Phoebe,The
261,Phoebe,Uh-huh.
262,Phoebe,Uh-huh.
263,Phoebe,"Umm, could-could I get a copy of that?"
264,Phoebe,"Cause Carol threw it out, she lost ours."
265,Phoebe,"She's such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass."
266,Chandler,"Y'know, that party wasn't bad."
267,Monica,Yeah!
268,Monica,I didn't know there would be dancing.
269,Monica,That was a fun surprise!
270,Chandler,"I don't see any uh, cabs."
271,Chandler,Maybe we should just walk?
272,Monica,"Oh no, we can't walk!"
273,Chandler,"What honey, it's like fifteen blocks to the subway."
274,Chandler,Let's go.
275,Monica,Hey!
276,Monica,Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?
277,Chandler,What's going on?
278,Monica,I can't walk.
279,Monica,Okay?
280,Monica,Okay?
281,Monica,These boots were a huge mistake!
282,Chandler,What?
283,Monica,Okay you were right!
284,Monica,"All right, I never should have bought them!"
285,Monica,They're killing me!
286,Monica,One toe at a time!
287,Chandler,So I was right.
288,Chandler,This is what it feels like to be right.
289,Chandler,It's oddly unsettling.
290,Monica,How are we gonna get home?
291,Monica,Maybe a piggy-back ride?
292,Chandler,Hop on.
293,Monica,Okay.
294,Monica,"Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first."
295,Monica,AhOohOohhOhhOh GodOhhOhOhhOhhhh
296,Chandler,"Honey, I know you're in pain right now, but I'm a little turned on."
297,Rachel,What college was that Dina?
298,Rachel,"Joey, what are you doing?"
299,Joey,Just what needs to be done!
300,Joey,"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman"
301,Rachel,Oh Joey this is crazy!
302,Joey,Don't interrupt me when I'm talkin' to God!
303,Joey,Now where were we?
304,Joey,"Oh right, okay."
305,Joey,"Do you Dina, take this man"
306,Joey,Oh you'll take em!
307,Joey,Hey!
308,Joey,You don't get a say in this!
309,Joey,Ahhh!
310,Joey,"I heard ""I do"", we're halfway there!"
311,Joey,Okay!
312,Joey,You!
313,Rachel,All right Joey!
314,Rachel,That is enough!
315,Rachel,"Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it's not legal."
316,Rachel,Okay?
317,Rachel,"They-they don't have a marriage license, they don't have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe!"
318,Joey,Well what am I supposed to do?
319,Rachel,You're supposed to realize that they are adults!
320,Rachel,And that they can make their own decisions.
321,Joey,No they can't!
322,Joey,They were stupid enough to get knocked up!
323,Rachel,Heyyyyy!
324,Rachel,Contraceptives are not always effective!
325,Rachel,Right?
326,Rachel,"Oh, come on kids!"
327,Rachel,A little help here!
328,Phoebe,Wow!
329,Phoebe,This place is incredible!
330,Phoebe,Sting's penthat he gave to Phoebe.
331,Phoebe,Come on!
332,Phoebe,Secret passageway!
333,Phoebe,Trudie
334,Phoebe,Hi!
335,Phoebe,Trudie
336,Phoebe,Uh-huh.
337,Phoebe,Trudie
338,Phoebe,Why else would I be here?
339,Phoebe,Trudie
340,Phoebe,Uh-huh.
341,Phoebe,Trudie
342,Phoebe,Yeah.
343,Phoebe,Trudie
344,Phoebe,"Umm, I'm sorry."
345,Phoebe,Won't-won't Jack's father be joining us?
346,Phoebe,Trudie
347,Phoebe,Uh-hmm.
348,Phoebe,Okay.
349,Phoebe,"Well then, could we reschedule?"
350,Phoebe,"For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 o'clock?"
351,Phoebe,Trudie
352,Phoebe,Concert.
353,Phoebe,Yeah.
354,Phoebe,That does put us inquite a pickle.
355,Phoebe,"Because you see I'm very busy before and after the concert, and he's obviously busy during."
356,Phoebe,Trudie
357,Phoebe,Unless!
358,Phoebe,"Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course."
359,Phoebe,Trudie
360,Phoebe,"Oh, thank you."
361,Phoebe,Four would be great.
362,Phoebe,Trudie
363,Phoebe,Oh good!
364,Phoebe,Then you're in luck!
365,Phoebe,Ben's not my son!
366,Phoebe,Trudie
367,Phoebe,The Police?
368,Phoebe,Here?
369,Phoebe,A reunion?
370,Chandler,"Okay, ten blocks down."
371,Chandler,Five to go.
372,Monica,Oh wait!
373,Monica,Stop!
374,Monica,Stop!
375,Monica,Stop!
376,Chandler,Oh I'm sorry!
377,Chandler,Do you need a break?
378,Monica,My boots in tan!
379,Monica,Hey!
380,Monica,Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
381,Chandler,I can see it from right here.
382,Chandler,It'll cost you one husband.
383,Monica,"Okay, I'm sorry."
384,Monica,I think I can walk the rest of the way now.
385,Monica,Just-just give me my boots.
386,Chandler,I don't have your boots.
387,Monica,Well I don't have them either.
388,Monica,Where are they?
389,Chandler,"Well, why don't you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!"
390,Monica,Okay.
391,Monica,"God well, we gotta go back and get them!"
392,Chandler,"Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?"
393,Monica,"Okay, I'm never gonna wear them again."
394,Monica,I just didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
395,Chandler,Y'know what?
396,Chandler,You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
397,Monica,Okay.
398,Monica,All right.
399,Chandler,Okay.
400,Monica,Bye bootsWait!
401,Monica,Half off?
402,Rachel,"Joey, just because they're not getting married doesn't mean this is going to be a disaster."
403,Rachel,Maybe they have a plan!
404,Joey,Oh?
405,Joey,Oh!
406,Joey,Okay!
407,Joey,Okay!
408,Joey,Let's hear their plan!
409,Joey,"Now, what's the future look like for Dina and Bobby?"
410,Joey,You were right.
411,Joey,He is funny.
412,Rachel,"Hey, now wait a minute!"
413,Rachel,I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you!
414,Rachel,"Now come on Bobby, why don't you tell us a little bit about your band?"
415,Rachel,Really?
416,Joey,"Dina, if you're having a baby you should be married!"
417,Joey,Even if it is to Bobby!
418,Joey,"Dude, that's not a compliment!"
419,Joey,So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
420,Joey,What are you gonna do?
421,Joey,You're gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourselfwithout a husband?!
422,Joey,You can't be a single mother alone!
423,Joey,You're gonna ruin your life!
424,Rachel,Oh excuse me!
425,Rachel,Am I ruining my life?
426,Joey,No!
427,Joey,No!
428,Joey,No!
429,Joey,It's different for you.
430,Joey,You're so strong and together.
431,Joey,You're not some dumb kid who doesn't know what she's doing.
432,Joey,"One pregnant woman at a time, please!"
433,Joey,I just want you to be okay.
434,Rachel,So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
435,Joey,Maybe!
436,Joey,Well!
437,Joey,"Wellso-so uh, what kind of music does Numb NutsOh forget it!"
438,Joey,I can't!
439,Joey,Because!
440,Joey,Cause Cause you're my baby sister!
441,Joey,"Well I'd be scared of them, but all right."
442,Joey,Of course he's gonna have his Uncle Joey!
443,Joey,That's right!
444,Joey,By his uncle too!
445,Rachel,"Okay Bobby, why don't we just come over here and let them have a little moment."
446,Joey,Come here!
447,Rachel,No!
448,Rachel,Seriously!
449,Rachel,What's wrong with you?!
450,Rachel,Closing Credits
451,Ross,You're gonna love me so much.
452,Ross,I got Sting tickets!
453,Phoebe,Oh my God!
454,Phoebe,I do love you!
455,Phoebe,How did you do it?
456,Ross,Welllet's just say  Rosss caaaaan!
457,Phoebe,"Oo, where are the seats?"
458,Ross,"Uh, middle balcony."
459,Phoebe,"Okay, now would you say that that's more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife, or a member of his family?"
460,Ross,Yeah.
461,Phoebe,Then that's not breaking the law!
462,Phoebe,I'm there!
463,Phoebe,End
