1,Rachel,Guess what?
2,Rachel,Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
3,Monica,Oh my God!
4,Phoebe,Wow!
5,Joey,What is the matter with you?
6,Phoebe,No!
7,Phoebe,Barry and Mindy.
8,Joey,"Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross."
9,Joey,Who-who's Barry and Mindy?
10,Rachel,Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
11,Joey,"Ohh-oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her?"
12,Rachel,"Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me."
13,Monica,Why did they get divorced?
14,Rachel,"Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else."
15,Rachel,Isn't that sad?
16,Rachel,"God, could you imagine if I actually married him?!"
17,Rachel,I mean how different would my life be?
18,Ross,"I know what you mean, I've always wondered how different my life would be if-if I'd never gotten divorced."
19,Phoebe,Which time?
20,Ross,The first time!
21,Ross,"No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian."
22,Joey,I can't.
23,Joey,I keep seeing it the good way.
24,Ross,I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay.
25,Ross,"Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical."
26,Chandler,Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
27,Monica,And what if I was still fat?
28,Monica,"Well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure."
29,Chandler,Sure I would!
30,Chandler,"What, you guys really think that I'm that shallow?"
31,Ross,"No, I just think Monica was that fat."
32,Joey,"Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives!"
33,Joey,"Oh-hey, there's Carol again!"
34,Chandler,What if I had had the guts to quit my job?
35,Chandler,"I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny."
36,Chandler,But my job's fun too!
37,Chandler,"I mean tomorrow, I-I don't have to wear a tie."
38,Phoebe,What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
39,Ross,What?
40,Rachel,Merrill Lynch?
41,Phoebe,"Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks."
42,Rachel,Well why didn't you take the job?
43,Phoebe,"Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true."
44,Phoebe,"So I thought y'know that if I'd work with stocks, I'd have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox."
45,Ross,"Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we'd still hang out?"

115,Joey,That's an idea!
116,Joey,"Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?"

484,Ross,"Well, I-I think Ben's asleep."
485,Ross,Yeah.
486,Ross,Right.
487,Ross,Save it.
488,Ross,I can do that.
489,Ross,"Hey, Pheebs!"
490,Phoebe,Hey.
491,Ross,"Hey, how's it going?"
492,Phoebe,"Well, I've got to get out of this bed, I'm going crazy here."
493,Phoebe,Crazy!
494,Monica,Here you go sweetie.
495,Phoebe,"What the hell is this, herbal tea?"
496,Phoebe,I hate herbal tea!
497,Monica,"But, I put some honey in it."
498,Ross,"She doesn't know she was fired yet, does she?"
499,Chandler,"No, the doctors say it may kill her."
500,Phoebe,What are you two girls whispering about over there?
501,Chandler,But I think we should tell her.
502,Ross,"Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job."
503,Phoebe,"Okay, what is this?"
504,Phoebe,A stupid contest?
505,Phoebe,Because we got a winner here!
506,Chandler,"Listen Phoebe, he's right."
507,Chandler,People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
508,Phoebe,I know!
509,Phoebe,"But if I didn't work there, what else would I do?"
510,Monica,"Well, you used to like playing the guitar."
511,Phoebe,Yeah that was lucrative!
512,Phoebe,Smart like your brother!
513,Chandler,"Uh, what about y'know the massage thing?"
514,Chandler,That never gave you a heart attack.
515,Phoebe,"Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump changeooh, what do I do?!"
516,Phoebe,What will I do?
517,Rachel,"Ohh, I mean it's just so realistic!"
518,Joey,I know.
519,Joey,"Yeah, his name is Pat."
520,Rachel,Pat the dog.
521,Rachel,Oh!
522,Rachel,Oh!
523,Rachel,I get it!
524,Joey,"Do you uh, do youready for a refill?"
525,Rachel,"Oh, I probably shouldn'tso I will!"
526,Rachel,Oh!
527,Rachel,Wow!
528,Rachel,It's like it's raining!
529,Joey,"Pretty cool, huh?"
530,Joey,"But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong."
531,Rachel,"Umm, can I use your bathroom?"
532,Joey,"It's uh, right through there."
533,Rachel,Okay.
534,Rachel,"God y'know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani's apartment"
535,Joey,"Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?"
536,Rachel,"Yeah, it sure is!"
537,Monica,"I hope you're hungry, we're starting with oysters."
538,Monica,"And y'know what they say about oysters, don't you?"
539,Monica,Dr.
540,Monica,No!
541,Monica,"Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac."
542,Monica,Dr.
543,Monica,People!
544,Monica,People say it!
545,Monica,Come here!
546,Monica,Dr.
547,Monica,And then we're gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous.
548,Monica,"Something we can eat, with our hands."
549,Monica,Dr.
550,Monica,"No-no-no, no!"
551,Monica,It's sensual!
552,Monica,Dr.
553,Monica,Okay!
554,Monica,Ohhh no!
555,Monica,Dr.
556,Monica,I can't promise anything.
557,Ross,"We're really gonna do this, huh?"
558,Ross,"Y'know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at"
559,Ross,Okay.
560,Ross,I'm-I'm Ross by the way.
561,Ross,How hot is this?
562,Chandler,I'm sorry you're here with me instead of Roger.
563,Monica,"Yeah, me too."
564,Chandler,"Well, I could make it seem like he's here."
565,Chandler,"""Here's some little known facts about cous-cous."
566,Chandler,"They didn't add the second cous until 1979."""
567,Monica,Stop it!!
568,Monica,That's not funny!
569,Chandler,Okay.
570,Monica,"I'm sorry, okay?"
571,Monica,"It justtonight was supposed to be y'know, it was supposed to be a big deal."
572,Chandler,What was tonight?
573,Monica,You don't want to know what tonight was.
574,Chandler,Okay.
575,Chandler,What was tonight?
576,Monica,"Well, tonight waswas going to be my first time."
577,Chandler,With Roger?
578,Chandler,Not just with Roger?!
579,Chandler,Oh my God!
580,Monica,All right relax Mr.
581,Monica,I've Had Sex Four Times!
582,Chandler,Four different women!
583,Chandler,I've had sex way more times!
584,Monica,How many?
585,Chandler,Nine.
586,Monica,I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
587,Chandler,"Well good, good for you."
588,Chandler,You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
589,Monica,No.
590,Monica,He's not a horrible guy.
591,Chandler,Hey that's what I tell girls about me.
592,Monica,"Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!"
593,Chandler,No you are not!
594,Chandler,You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
595,Monica,Oh really?
596,Monica,When?
597,Monica,Do you wanna do it with me?
598,Chandler,Okay.
599,Monica,I was kidding.
600,Chandler,So was I.
601,Rachel,"Joey, you're such an amazing actor!"
602,Rachel,How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
603,Joey,"Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say."
604,Joey,"And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own."
605,Rachel,Wow!
606,Rachel,Tell me something JoeyWhoa!
607,Rachel,I just fell right off the couch there.
608,Joey,Yeah you did.
609,Rachel,Okay.
610,Joey,Here you go.
611,Joey,Let me ask you a question.
612,Rachel,Yeah?
613,Joey,When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
614,Rachel,Wow!
615,Rachel,"I can't, I can't feel my hands."
616,Joey,"Come, come here."
617,Chandler,We can't do this.
618,Monica,No!
619,Monica,Oyster?
620,Chandler,Yeah!
621,Chandler,"If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y'know?"
622,Chandler,Because you've been waiting a very long time and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
623,Monica,Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too.
624,Monica,"So even if you're horrible, how would I know?"
625,Chandler,I do like that.
626,Monica,It's harder for me!
627,Monica,I have those four other women to compete with!
628,Chandler,"Well, if it helps there were only three."
629,Chandler,"So it would just be for tonight, right?"
630,Monica,Absolutely!
631,Monica,It would just be one friend  helping out another friend.
632,Chandler,Stop it!
633,Chandler,We're doing this!
634,Chandler,Let's do it!
635,Monica,Noo!!
636,Monica,Okay!
637,Chandler,Okay!
638,Monica,"Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?"
639,Chandler,I have some moves.
640,Monica,I have no moves.
641,Monica,"Okay, whatcha doin' there?!"
642,Monica,Oh y'know what?
643,Monica,"I'm sorry, this is just too weird."
644,Chandler,"Yeah, let's just forget it."
645,Monica,What if I turn out the lights?
646,Chandler,Okay!
647,Chandler,Oh yeah.
648,Monica,Chandler?
649,Chandler,Yeah?
650,Monica,That's the couch.
651,Monica,Commercial Break
652,Chandler,Oh my God!
653,Monica,I know!
654,Monica,"I'll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!"
655,Chandler,"Oh, okay!"
656,Joey,Morning!
657,Rachel,Oh right.
658,Joey,Yeah.
659,Rachel,Oh God.
660,Rachel,Oh I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
661,Joey,Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
662,Rachel,Noo!
663,Rachel,"Oh God we didwe didn't, we didn't uhh"
664,Joey,No!
665,Joey,No!
666,Joey,"No, not after seeing that."
667,Rachel,God I'm just a horrible person.
668,Joey,Wh-why?
669,Rachel,Because I'm married.
670,Rachel,"That's right, I am a married woman!"
671,Rachel,And I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair!
672,Rachel,Uck!
673,Joey,That's ridiculous!
674,Joey,"I'm not a ""Star,"" just a regular famous actor."
675,Rachel,"Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person."
676,Joey,"Rachel, would you stop saying that?!"
677,Joey,"Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me"
678,Rachel,"The ring from the cave, yeah."
679,Joey,Wow!
680,Joey,"Uh okay, well uh"
681,Rachel,"Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?"
682,Joey,Sure!
683,Joey,As long as they don't find out you can keep whatever you want!
684,Joey,And I want you to have it.
685,Rachel,No!
686,Rachel,No-no-no
687,Joey,Yes!
688,Joey,Yes!!
689,Joey,"And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person."
690,Joey,"Okay, you've had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn't."
691,Joey,And that's what this ring stands for.
692,Rachel,But I thought that ring stood for Caprice's undying love for her brother.
693,Joey,"Look, do you want the ring or not?"
694,Rachel,Yeah!
695,Ross,Hey!
696,Joey,Hey!
697,Ross,Look at you!
698,Ross,You're up!
699,Joey,All right!
700,Phoebe,I thought I'd try to take a walk.
701,Phoebe,Would you pour me some water?
702,Phoebe,I'll be back soon.
703,Joey,Whoa-whoa-whoa!
704,Joey,"You're not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?"
705,Phoebe,No.
706,Phoebe,I've learned my lesson.
707,Phoebe,Let's go!
708,Phoebe,Come on!
709,Phoebe,Move it!
710,Phoebe,Come on!
711,Phoebe,Shoes!
712,Phoebe,Briefcase!
713,Phoebe,"Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder."
714,Ross,Hey Joe did Did you ever have a threesome?
715,Joey,"Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol's great and I'm sure you're a very attractive man, but I."
716,Ross,No!
717,Ross,The reason I'm asking is that I sorta had one last night.
718,Joey,You?
719,Ross,Yeah!
720,Joey,Wow!
721,Ross,Yeah!
722,Joey,All right!
723,Joey,"So, was it amazing?"
724,Ross,"It was, it was okay."
725,Joey,Just okayDid you do it right?
726,Ross,"Look, it's just did, did you ever go to a party and think, ""Would really anyone miss me if I weren't here?"""
727,Joey,Huh.
728,Joey,"But still Ross, you're worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day!"
729,Joey,Y'know what I mean?
730,Ross,"Oh-oh, absolutely!"
731,Ross,"It's just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around."
732,Joey,"But you got to be with both of them, right?"
733,Ross,Not-not really.
734,Ross,Th-th-there was just Carol.
735,Joey,Not the other one?
736,Ross,"No, she kept kicking me away!"
737,Joey,"Yeah, you don't want that."
738,Ross,No!
739,Joey,"Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?"
740,Ross,Oh I a lot of stuff!
741,Joey,You got a little bored?
742,Ross,A little.
743,Ross,Yeah.
744,Ross,I made a snack.
745,Joey,Yeah?
746,Joey,What did ya have?
747,Ross,Just a sandwich.
748,Ross,"Turkey, a little mustard"
749,Joey,Sounds good.
750,Ross,It really was!
751,Chandler,Hey!
752,Monica,Hey!
753,Chandler,Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night!
754,Chandler,Oh no wait a minute that was you!
755,Monica,"Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!"
756,Chandler,"So you uh, want to do something tonight?"
757,Monica,Oh I can't.
758,Monica,Dr. Roger is coming over again.
759,Chandler,Oh.
760,Chandler,Oh right!
761,Chandler,Right!
762,Chandler,"Because you're still seeing him and uh, he's a good guy."
763,Chandler,"I mean, I remember a time when"
764,Monica,Are you okay?
765,Chandler,Yeah!
766,Chandler,Totally!
767,Chandler,"Totally, and you?"
768,Monica,Great!
769,Monica,It's so amazing!
770,Monica,"I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I'm all like, ""Can the doctor see me now?"""
771,Chandler,I bet he can.
772,Monica,"Y'know, I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical."
773,Monica,Are you sure you're okay?
774,Chandler,Oh yeah!
775,Chandler,Yeah!
776,Chandler,"Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!"
777,Rachel,Ohh!
778,Rachel,My God!
779,Rachel,Barry!
780,Rachel,Oh that's right!
781,Rachel,I'm sorry!
782,Rachel,I-I am early!
783,Rachel,Finish!
784,Rachel,Please!
785,Phoebe,Surprise!
786,Phoebe,Look who's back!
787,Phoebe,Hey!
788,Phoebe,"Uh, I don't think so!"
789,Phoebe,Jack!!
790,Phoebe,Hey!
791,Phoebe,All better!
792,Phoebe,Back to work!
793,Phoebe,Except this clown from research told me I was fired.
794,Phoebe,"He should do his research, huh?"
795,Phoebe,Nu-uh!
796,Phoebe,"Oh, okay I didn't get that message."
797,Phoebe,"So this doesn't countAnyway, I'll be in my office."
798,Phoebe,"That's all right, I'll work here."
799,Phoebe,"This is goo, next to this plant."
800,Phoebe,You're in my office!
801,Phoebe,"Look, I have made a lot of cash for this company!"
802,Phoebe,Okay?
803,Phoebe,I am talking big bucks!
804,Phoebe,Pesos!
805,Phoebe,Yen!
806,Phoebe,Rubles!
807,Phoebe,You make one little mistake
808,Phoebe,"Oh, so this is all about money!"
809,Phoebe,Y'know it's bad enough thatOw!
810,Phoebe,"Oh, you have got to be kidding!"
811,Phoebe,I'm having another heart attack!
812,Phoebe,I'm having another heart attack!!
813,Phoebe,Call 9-1-1!
814,Phoebe,Dumbass!
815,Phoebe,"Well, they fired me and I'm having heart attack."
816,Phoebe,Yeah.
817,Rachel,Hi Ross!
818,Ross,Hey Rachel.
819,Rachel,Is Joey Tribbiani here?
820,Ross,"Umm, no."
821,Rachel,"Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I'm looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!"
822,Ross,That-that's always good news.
823,Ross,Are you okay?
824,Rachel,Me?
825,Rachel,I'm great!
826,Rachel,I'm fine!
827,Rachel,I'm sooo good!!
828,Rachel,"But, you know who's not great?!"
829,Rachel,Men!
830,Rachel,You're a man right Ross?
831,Ross,Yeah.
832,Rachel,Sit down!
833,Ross,Okay.
834,Rachel,"Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?!"
835,Rachel,"And why is it that the second we tell you we're going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor's dog walker?"
836,Ross,We're sorry.
837,Rachel,No seriously!
838,Rachel,Seriously!
839,Rachel,What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
840,Ross,Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?
841,Rachel,Aw what are you?!
842,Rachel,A detective?
843,Ross,"Look I-I don't know what's going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that."
844,Rachel,Oh.
845,Ross,Hey!
846,Ross,There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work!
847,Ross,Okay?
848,Ross,There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
849,Rachel,Who are these men?
850,Ross,Men.
851,Ross,I guy I know.
852,Rachel,"Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is  gay."
853,Ross,She is not  She's gay.
854,Ross,Oh my God.
855,Ross,She is so gay!
856,Ross,I can't believe this.
857,Rachel,Good day for married people huh?
858,Ross,I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
859,Rachel,I'm sorry your wife is gay.
860,Rachel,I guess women aren't that great either.
861,Ross,Try telling my wife that.
862,Chandler,Okay to come in?
863,Monica,"Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want."
864,Monica,Dr. Roger got beeped again.
865,Chandler,"Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?"
866,Monica,What?
867,Chandler,I'm the ruptured spleen.
868,Monica,Why would you do that?
869,Chandler,Because you shouldn't be with him.
870,Chandler,You should be with me.
871,Monica,Really?
872,Chandler,Yeah!
873,Chandler,"When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me!"
874,Chandler,"Look, things like last night they don't just happen."
875,Chandler,Y'know?
876,Chandler,Or at least not to me.
877,Chandler,"Or with the other two women, in the morning y'know I was just lying there and I couldn't wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y'know with a friend."
878,Monica,Chandler!
879,Chandler,"I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a ""doctor"""
880,Monica,"There was just one woman, wasn't there?"
881,Chandler,"No, there were two."
882,Monica,Including me?
883,Chandler,Oh yeah.
884,Chandler,Ending Credits
885,Phoebe,"It only takes two heart attacks to finally make you see     One of them won't do it, but the second one will set you free     Tell all your hate and anger, it's time to say good-bye     And that is just what I will do, soon as those bastards I work for die!"
886,Phoebe,"La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la   End"
