9,Chandler,"No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this"
10,Phoebe,Oh my God!
11,Phoebe,That's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.

13,Monica,"Oh, here's a great one."
14,Chandler,"Yeah, I'm not in that."
15,Monica,"I know, but look at me all tan."

37,Phoebe,But he's getting divorcedRoss!
38,Phoebe,Maybe you know him.
39,Ross,It's not a club.
40,Rachel,"Phoebe, if this guy's going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him?"
41,Ross,"Hey, divorced men are not bad men!"
42,Chandler,They have that on the napkins at the club.
43,Rachel,"Oh, I gotta get back to work."
44,Phoebe,You don't have to be back for a half-hour!
45,Rachel,"Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch."
46,Rachel,Ohh!
47,Rachel,I could just spread him on a cracker.
48,Chandler,"Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him?"
49,Chandler,I mean y'know you can't date him right?
50,Rachel,"Oh no, I know that."
51,Rachel,I know that.
52,Rachel,"Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife."
53,Ross,"Soon he'll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired."
54,Rachel,"I am not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it."
55,Phoebe,So you wouldn't mind if he was dating someone else?
56,Rachel,Why?
57,Rachel,Is he?
58,Rachel,He is!
59,Rachel,Isn't he?
60,Rachel,He's dating that slut in marketing!
61,Ross,Maybe I should open a divorced men's club.
62,Chandler,Dude that is so sad.
63,Ross,I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
64,Chandler,Could I play?
65,Rachel,"Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?"
66,Rachel,"Oh, well drop and give me ten more!"
67,Rachel,"Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch."

115,Joey,Really?

130,Monica,What is the matter with your face?!
131,Monica,"I mean this picture is supposed to say ""Geller and Bing to be married,"" not ""Local woman saves drowning moron!"""

185,Phoebe,You were supposed to divert her not date her!
186,Ross,Hi!
187,Ross,"I'm sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night."
188,Ross,Okay.
189,Ross,I did divert her and we ended up having a great time!
190,Ross,Okay?
191,Phoebe,Watching ballroom dancing?
192,Ross,Yes!
193,Ross,That's where we realized we were both super cool people!
194,Phoebe,"Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her."
195,Ross,Like what?
196,Phoebe,"Like she's really mean, and she's over critical, and-andNo!"
197,Phoebe,She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!
198,Ross,Okay.
199,Phoebe,And!
200,Phoebe,She uses sex as a weapon!
201,Ross,Fine!
202,Ross,Thank you for warning me.
203,Ross,At breakfast I'll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
204,Phoebe,You're still gonna go out with her?
205,Ross,Yeah!
206,Phoebe,"Well, didn't you just hear what I said?"
207,Ross,Pheebs come on!
208,Ross,"I mean, consider the source!"
209,Ross,Of course her ex-husband's gonna say that stuff.

225,Joey,That's a great smile!
226,Joey,Easy.
227,Joey,Natural.
228,Joey,"Now, pretend I have a camera."
229,Joey,You're changing it!
230,Chandler,I can't help it!
231,Joey,"All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?"
232,Chandler,Borrow money from me?
233,Joey,"Okay, firstfirst of all, you want to make it look spontaneous."
234,Joey,"I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up."

247,Joey,What?
248,Rachel,"Y'know, all the women."
249,Joey,"Hey well, you can't teach someone to be good with women."
250,Joey,"Y'know, that's why I never had any luck with Chandler."
251,Chandler,I'm right here!
252,Rachel,"All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again?"
253,Rachel,"Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it's justAnd I know he's my assistant and I can't date himbut it just bothers me, all right?"
254,Joey,Hey!
255,Joey,"No-no-no-no, you can't take him away from me!"
256,Joey,I got a great partner to pick up girls with!
257,Joey,Finally!
258,Chandler,I'm still right here!
259,Rachel,"All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!"
260,Joey,What?
261,Rachel,I just don't want him to meet anybody until I am over my crushAnd I will get over it.
262,Rachel,"It's-it's not like I love him, it's just physical!"
263,Rachel,ButI mean I get crushes like this all the time!
264,Rachel,"I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!"
265,Joey,"I know, Monica told me."
266,Chandler,"Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?"
267,Rachel,Yeah.
268,Rachel,Sure.
269,Chandler,Can you people not see me?
270,Rachel,"So, will you talk to him?"
271,Joey,I don't know Rach.
272,Rachel,"Oh, come on!"
273,Rachel,I'll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
274,Joey,One!
275,Joey,No ten!
276,Joey,You said ten!
277,Joey,You can't take that back!
278,Joey,I don't know.
279,Joey,"You uh, you got something for me?"
280,Joey,Ten.
281,Joey,Okay.
282,Joey,Now Tag there's such a thing as to many women.

286,Chandler,There I am!
287,Monica,Are you okay?
288,Chandler,"Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine."
289,Monica,What?
290,Chandler,"Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn."
291,Chandler,Brooklyn is f-far!
292,Monica,"Chandler, what were you thinking?"
293,Chandler,"I don't know, but don't worry, don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now."

300,Phoebe,"So, how are things going with crazy?"
301,Phoebe,Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
302,Ross,"Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okayand F.Y.I she must've shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room!"
303,Ross,"And his response to each one was, ""I don't give a tiny rat's ass."""
304,Phoebe,"Yeah well, maybe she should've spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom."
305,Ross,"Well, I don't think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that's just because I am not emotionally unavailable!"
306,Phoebe,You think he's emotionally unavailable?
307,Ross,I think he can be.
308,Phoebe,"Well, maybe he wouldn't be she didn't bring the office home every night!"
309,Ross,"Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!"
310,Phoebe,"Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997."
311,Ross,I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!!
312,Ross,That was three years ago!
313,Ross,She apologized and she apologized!
314,Ross,What more do you want?!
315,Phoebe,We want the last six years back!

341,Ross,My God!
342,Phoebe,"Oh, I'm sorry."
343,Phoebe,Is that annoying?
344,Phoebe,"And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?"
345,Ross,Well maybe she wouldn't have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!
346,Phoebe,Oh he knows!
347,Phoebe,For the most part.
348,Phoebe,Both of you together?
349,Ross,Wh-what's up?
350,Ross,Oh just say it Kyle!
351,Phoebe,What about her whining and her constant need for attention?
352,Phoebe,"Oh right, because you're so capable of change."
353,Ross,"Y'know, he hums when he pees!"
354,Ross,"It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever."
355,Ross,"That's all right, we-we don't need you."
356,Ross,"In fact, hey I'm over it already."
357,Phoebe,"Yeah, and y'know what?"
358,Phoebe,I don't give a tiny rat's ass.
359,Ross,I'm sorry.
360,Ross,"Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her."
361,Ross,"Y'know, she did try to use sex as a weapon!"
362,Ross,"Yeah, I hurt my back a little."
363,Phoebe,Oh.
364,Phoebe,"Y'know, he hums while he does other stuff to."
365,Ross,"Yeah, were better off without them."
366,Phoebe,"And y'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!"
