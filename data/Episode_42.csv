190,Monica,"So, I'm just checkin'."
191,Monica,"So let me know, or don't, whatever."
192,Monica,"I'm breezy."""
193,Joey,"Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy."
194,Joey,Woman's

196,Joey,Commercial Break
197,Monica,He's seeing someone.
198,Monica,I can't believe he's seeing someone.
199,Phoebe,"Monica, you don't know that."
200,Monica,"Well, who's voice was that?"
201,Chandler,Maybe it was his sister's.
202,Chandler,"You know, maybe it was his daughter's."
203,Monica,Michelle!
204,Monica,"Of course, it was Michelle!"
205,Monica,Did it sound like Michelle?
206,Ross,"Oh, great."
207,Ross,"It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab."
208,Monica,It was Michelle.
209,Monica,It was definitely Michelle.
210,Rachel,"Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress."
211,Rachel,"If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one."
212,Rachel,"Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?"
213,Ross,"You don't, you don't know what your wearing?"
214,Rachel,"Well, hon-ey."
215,Rachel,I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
216,Ross,"Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes."
217,Ross,"All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you."
218,Chandler,"All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed."
219,Chandler,"I, in turn, have noticed that you are not."
220,Chandler,So in the words of A.
221,Chandler,"A. Milne, ""Get out of my chair, dillhole!"""
222,Joey,Okay.
223,Chandler,What are you doing?
224,Joey,"You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions."
225,Chandler,The cushions are the essence of the chair!
226,Joey,That's right!
227,Joey,I'm taking the essence.
228,Chandler,"Oh-ho, it'll be back."
229,Chandler,"Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room."
230,Ross,"Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty."
231,Rachel,"Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep."
232,Ross,"Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep."
233,Rachel,"Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days."
234,Phoebe,"Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me!"
235,Rachel,"Oh, it's perfect!"
236,Rachel,But not for tonight.
237,Phoebe,"Well, of course not for tonight."
238,Phoebe,"Yeah, hi!"
239,Ross,Not for tonight.
240,Ross,Not for tonight!
241,Ross,"Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?"
242,Rachel,"No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it."
243,Rachel,I love you.
244,Rachel,I love you.
245,Chandler,We used them as pillows when we went camping.
246,Ross,What?
247,Chandler,The sheep.
248,Ross,"Hey, what you do on your own time..."
249,Joey,Where's my underwear?
250,Ross,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
251,Ross,"Come on, come on, what."
252,Ross,You took his underwear?
253,Chandler,He took my essence!
254,Ross,"Okay, now hold on."
255,Ross,"Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?"
256,Joey,"Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now."
257,Ross,"Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?"
258,Joey,It's a rented tux.
259,Joey,Okay.
260,Joey,I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
261,Chandler,"Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions."
262,Joey,"Okay, you hide my clothes."
263,Joey,I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
264,Chandler,"What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?"
265,Joey,"Hey, opposite, is opposite!"
266,Chandler,He's got nothing!
267,Phoebe,"Okay, I'm ready."
268,Phoebe,Ross and
269,Chandler,"Oh, aaaah!"
270,Phoebe,"Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'"
271,Chandler,What are you supporting?
272,Phoebe,Duh!!
273,Phoebe,Christmas!
274,Ross,"Okay, hey, that's okay with me."
275,Ross,"Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped."
276,Ross,My watch.
277,Ross,"Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more."
278,Ross,What time is it?
279,Ross,It's
280,Rachel,"Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear?"
281,Rachel,The black or the purple?
282,Ross,"Just, just, just pick one!"
283,Phoebe,"Okay, okay, okay, the black."
284,Phoebe,"But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?"
285,Rachel,"Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants."
286,Rachel,Maybe I should wear pants?
287,Ross,"Yeah, pants, what, what an idea."
288,Ross,"Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants."
289,Ross,"Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay."
290,Ross,"No, no I don't care if they match."
291,Ross,I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat.
292,Ross,Okay.
293,Rachel,But I...
294,Ross,"No, no, no just do it."
295,Ross,Go in there and pick something out so we can go.
296,Rachel,All right.
297,Ross,Thank you!
298,Monica,Okay.
299,Monica,I gotta call Michelle.
300,Monica,I gotta see if that was her voice or not.
301,Monica,"I'm sorry, I just have to."
302,Ross,"It was, it was her voice."
303,Chandler,"Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place."
304,Monica,Okay.
305,Monica,That was her right?
306,Phoebe,Definitely.
307,Monica,See there you go.
308,Monica,Woo!
309,Monica,We're out of the woods.
310,Monica,"Okay, I'll get dressed now."
311,Ross,Yay!
312,Phoebe,"I'll get it, okay."
313,Phoebe,"Hi, Monica and Rachel's."
314,Phoebe,"Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling."
315,Phoebe,"Oh, ew, it's Michelle!"
316,Phoebe,Ew!
317,Phoebe,"She, she must have that Caller Id thing."
318,Phoebe,You should get that.
319,Monica,"Uh, Michelle."
320,Monica,"Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake."
321,Monica,"Oh, you're so sweet."
322,Monica,"Yeah, we were a great couple."
323,Monica,I know I really miss him.
324,Monica,"Well, you know how it is, it's that...."
325,Chandler,You know what's weird.
326,Chandler,Donald Duck never wore pants.
327,Chandler,"But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist."
328,Chandler,"I mean, what is that about?"
329,Monica,"Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message."
330,Monica,I mean that's allowed.
331,Monica,Yeah-huh!
332,Monica,"I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about."
333,Monica,"What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this?"
334,Monica,Come on we're friends!!
335,Monica,That bitch always hated me.
336,Monica,I'm calling her back.
337,Ross,"No, no, no, no."
338,Ross,"Tick, tick, tick, tick."
339,Monica,"Okay, fine."
340,Chandler,"They got a phone in there, right?"
341,Phoebe,"Okay, we're on it."
342,Phoebe,We're on it.
343,Ross,Um.
344,Ross,"I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um."
345,Rachel,I'm not gonna gooo.
346,Ross,You're not going to go.
347,Rachel,"No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence."
348,Ross,"How, how, um how can you not be going?"
349,Rachel,"I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going."
350,Ross,"Um, you know, just out of curiosity..."
351,Rachel,"Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood."
352,Ross,Right.
353,Ross,"Right, okay, okay."
354,Ross,I'm sorry.
355,Ross,I'm sorry I yelled.
356,Rachel,It's fine.
357,Ross,"No, but, your-your mad."
358,Rachel,I'm not mad.
359,Ross,No.
360,Rachel,I'm just not going.
361,Ross,Your not going.
362,Rachel,Right.
363,Ross,Okay.
364,Ross,You know that I-I have to go.
365,Rachel,"Um, hum."
366,Ross,Right.
367,Ross,So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'
368,Rachel,No.
369,Ross,"No, because your not upset."
370,Rachel,Right.
371,Ross,About the yelling.
372,Rachel,"Right, and the humiliating."
373,Ross,"Oh, well of course, the humiliating."
374,Ross,"So, so wee, we're okay."
375,Rachel,"Um, hum."
376,Ross,We're good.
377,Rachel,Right.
378,Ross,Okay.
379,Ross,Honey?
380,Rachel,"Yes, Ross."
381,Ross,I love you.
382,Phoebe,Get away from that!
383,Phoebe,No!
384,Phoebe,She's just getting dressed.
385,Chandler,Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
386,Joey,"Okay, buddy-boy."
387,Joey,Here it is.
388,Joey,"You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own."
389,Chandler,Oh my God!
390,Chandler,That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!
391,Joey,Look at me!
392,Joey,I'm Chandler!
393,Joey,Could I be wearing any more clothes?
394,Joey,Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
395,Chandler,Oooo-ooh!
396,Joey,Yeah.
397,Joey,"Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on."
398,Joey,"I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges."
399,Ross,"Okay, okay."
400,Ross,"Enough, enough with the lunging."
401,Ross,No!
402,Ross,I'm sick of this.
403,Ross,Okay.
404,Ross,I've had it up to here with you two!
405,Ross,Neither you can come to the party!
406,Chandler,"Jeez, what a baby."
407,Joey,"Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it."
408,Joey,I was just going to get dressed.
409,Ross,You know what I don't care.
410,Ross,"The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go."
411,Ross,"Look Rach, I'm sorry."
412,Ross,Okay.
413,Ross,"Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk."
414,Ross,I'm sorry I yelled.
415,Ross,"I want you there, I need you there."
416,Ross,"Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there."
417,Joey,You could drink the fat.
418,Ross,"Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation."
419,Rachel,"No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute."
420,Rachel,"That actually, uh, that sounds interesting."
421,Ross,What?
422,Rachel,I think you should drink the fat.
423,Joey,Yaaaay!
424,Ross,"Okay, okay."
425,Ross,"If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there."
426,Ross,Then that's what I'll do.
427,Phoebe,"Oh, wait, let me get you another glass."
428,Phoebe,That's been sitting out.
429,Ross,I think this will be fine.
430,Ross,"Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it."
431,Ross,Cheers.
432,Rachel,"No, no, no, wait!"
433,Rachel,"Okay, okay."
434,Rachel,Don't!
435,Rachel,"I'll go, I'll go!"
436,Ross,You will?
437,Rachel,"You were really gonna do that, weren't you?"
438,Ross,"Well, yeah."
439,Rachel,You were gonna drink the fat.
440,Joey,Let's see what else he'll do!
441,Ross,"How 'bout instead you, go get changed!"
442,Ross,"You, give him back his underwear!"
443,Ross,"I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes!"
444,Ross,Monica!
445,Chandler,Stop it.
446,Chandler,Stop it!
447,Phoebe,"Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing!"
448,Phoebe,"No, Monica, no!"
449,Monica,Not any more!
450,Monica,"Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know."
451,Monica,"Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest."
452,Monica,"I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing."
453,Monica,"Okay, bye."
454,Monica,Outgoing!
455,Monica,Did that say outgoing?!
456,Monica,"Not, outgoing!!"
457,Monica,"""Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know."""
458,Monica,Nooo!
459,Phoebe,How did you do that?
460,Monica,I don't know!
461,Monica,Noooo!!!
462,Ross,"Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people."
463,Ross,Go!
464,Ross,Go!
465,Ross,Go!
466,Monica,Maybe we could call the phone company.
