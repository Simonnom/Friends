166,Monica,Mhmm.
167,Chandler,"You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife?"
168,Chandler,Is she  here by the way?
169,Monica,"Don't joke  with me, okay?"
170,Monica,"I'm very, very upset right  now."
171,Chandler,"Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?"
172,Monica,Yes.

195,Ross,"I would, but I bruise like a peach."
196,Ross,"Besides, yyou know,  everything is gonna be fine."
197,Ross,The baby's sleeping.
198,Rachel,What if she jumped out the bassinet?
199,Ross,"Can't hold her own head up, but yeah jumped."
200,Rachel,"Oh my god, I left the water running."
201,Ross,Rach you did not leave the water running.
202,Ross,"Please, just pull  yourself together, okay?"
203,Rachel,"Ah, did I leave the stove on?"
204,Ross,You never cooked since 1996.
205,Rachel,Is the window open?
206,Rachel,"Because if there's a window open, a bird  could fly in there."
207,Ross,"Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think you're right."
208,Ross,"I think   listen, listen!"
209,Rachel,Ubb.
210,Ross,"A pigeon, a pigeon."
211,Ross,"No, no  wait, no-no, an eagle flew in."
212,Ross,Landed on the stove and caught fire.
213,Ross,"The baby,  seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid."
214,Ross,"The eagle,  however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon."
215,Ross,Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water.
216,Ross,"Baby and bird still up lays   are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the  apartment."
217,Rachel,"Boy, are you gonna be sorry if that's true."
218,Joey,Hey.
219,Joey,Maybe we should just eat now.
220,Joey,Wha-a how about
221,Joey,But it happens?
222,Joey,I'm gotta go to the  bathroom.
223,Phoebe,"No, you can't go."
224,Phoebe,"No-no-no, I can't hold this table on my own."
225,Phoebe,"If they ask me to move, I cave."
226,Joey,"If you ask me to stay, I'll pee."
227,Joey,Maitre D'
228,Phoebe,"Okay, fine, I'll move."
229,Phoebe,"Alright, you don't have to manhandle  me."

235,Joey,"Pheebs, who the helluhuhh!"
236,Monica,Spend more time with the tie.
237,Monica,That'll make a baby.
238,Chandler,"Look, I can't do this."
239,Chandler,I can't make luv to you while we're  fighting this way.
240,Monica,"Oh sure, now you're Mister Sensitivity."
241,Monica,But when you wanted to  have sex right after my uncle's funeral
242,Chandler,That was a celebration of life.
243,Chandler,"Alright, look, I'm not gonna  do this."
244,Chandler,"Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?"
245,Monica,"No, you're right."
246,Monica,"Mnya, we shouldn't do it like this."
247,Monica,Huch.
248,Monica,"For what it's worth, I'm, I'm sorry."
249,Monica,I shouldn't have come down on you so hard  about the smoking.
250,Monica,"So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world."
251,Chandler,Mean it?
252,Monica,Yah.
253,Chandler,You are incredible.
254,Chandler,"Unless, II'm not gonna smoke again."
255,Chandler,"And  if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you."
256,Monica,D'you want to?
257,Chandler,"Yeah, let's celebrate life!"
258,Monica,'kay.
259,Rachel,"Och, god."
260,Rachel,"Oh, thank god, you're okay."
261,Rachel,I'm so  sorry we left you.
262,Rachel,Mom never gonna leave you again.
263,Rachel,Never ever ever again.
264,Rachel,Uch.
265,Ross,Great.
266,Ross,So let's get going?
267,Rachel,Oh no.
268,Rachel,I mean it.
269,Rachel,"After what just happened, I'm never leaving  her again."
270,Rachel,Ms.
271,Ross,Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.
272,Chandler,Uhh.
273,Chandler,You are welcome.
274,Monica,You know what?
275,Monica,Let's not talk.
276,Chandler,What?
277,Monica,Uch.
278,Monica,I am still so mad at you for smoking.
279,Chandler,But you said you forgave me.
280,Chandler,It was just a couple of  cigarettesno big deal.
281,Monica,"Oh, blablablabaybaybay."
282,Chandler,Leave it.
283,Monica,I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said  you wouldn't have sex with me while we're fighting.
284,Chandler,You tricked me to get me into bed?
285,Monica,"That's right, I got mine."
286,Chandler,I feel so used.
287,Phoebe,"Well, I guess they're not coming."
288,Phoebe,You wanna just order?
289,Joey,Thank you.
290,Joey,Waiter!
291,Joey,"'lright,  this is gonna be fast, so try to keep"
292,Phoebe,Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?
293,Phoebe,"Both it is, thank you."
294,Joey,"Oh, uh, again."
295,Joey,Can I make a special
296,Rachel,"Hey, hi, hi!"
297,Phoebe,You guys are over an hour late.
298,Phoebe,What happened to you two?
299,Ross,I'm so sorry
300,Rachel,"We got locked out of the apartment, we"
301,Joey,That's a great storycan I eat it?
302,Ross,And then Rachel wasn't sure she could leave the baby.
303,Rachel,"N-it wasn't easy, but it's your birthday and I did what I got  to do."
304,Phoebe,And that's Judy over there at the bar with Emma?
305,Rachel,"Oh honey, this is for the best, thus I'm not distracted,  worrying about Emma, how she's doing at home and I'm being completely here with  you and, oh, she spit up!"
306,Ross,What?
307,Rachel,She spit up.
308,Rachel,Judy!
309,Rachel,She spiJudy!
310,Rachel,"Look alive, Judy!"
311,Rachel,Thank you.
312,Ross,Thanks.
313,Ross,Oh.
314,Rachel,"Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious."
315,Rachel,What should I ha-ave?
316,Rachel,What should I have?
317,Joey,Never hit a woman.
318,Joey,Never hit a woman.
319,Ross,Y'know this ???
320,Ross,is incredible.
321,Joey,Ross bruises like a peach.
322,Joey,He bruises like a peach.
323,Ross,"Okay, I'll have the fixed salad and the duck."
324,Rachel,"Yah, I'll have the soup and the salmon."
325,Joey,And remember whatever comes up first.
326,Joey,Okay?
327,Joey,"And hurry, because"
328,Monica,Happy birthday!
329,Joey,Son of a bitch!
330,Phoebe,Wher-where have you been?
331,Monica,"Well, we had a little fight."
332,Chandler,I would never lie to get someone into bed.
333,Monica,You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy.
334,Monica,"Ooh, uh, thanks."
335,Monica,"Wow, little tight, isn't it?"
336,Monica,How d'you get a bigger table?
337,Monica,"You-you had a big table, but they made you move."
338,Monica,"Huh-huh, shut up Monica."
339,Monica,"Whoo,  I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck."
340,Chandler,I suppose that Monica will have the  manipulative  shrew.
341,Joey,Why are you going?
342,Joey,"He said, she wanted the shrew!"
343,Ross,"Rach, c'mon, Emma is fine."
344,Ross,You're turning into an obsessive  mother.
345,Ross,"Okay, you need to stop."
346,Rachel,Y'guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to the  beauty salon?
347,Chandler,You mean the lully story?
348,Ross,"Huh-huh, they already know it."
349,Phoebe,"You guys, we've been waiting for you for a long time, maybe  you should order."
350,Joey,"No, no, it's okay, I already told the waiter what  they want."
351,Monica,Why would you do that?
352,Joey,"Chandler, control your woman!"
353,Rachel,"Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would  like to start the celebration and make a toast  to Phoebe."
354,Rachel,She dropped her  sock.
355,Phoebe,Aw  what?
356,Rachel,"N-no, Emma dropped her sock."
357,Monica,Mom's here?
358,Monica,"I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me  she was out of town."
359,Rachel,"Ross, she still has not noticed that the baby's sock is on the  ground."
360,Phoebe,'s a good toast.
361,Rachel,Could you please get her attention?
362,Ross,W-oa  Mommy!
363,Phoebe,"Oh, for god's sake, Judy, pick up the sock!"
364,Phoebe,Pick  up the sock!
365,Phoebe,Pick up the sock!
366,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, was that rude?"
367,Phoebe,"Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt  the hideousness  that is this  evening?"
368,Phoebe,"Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was  have dinner with my friends on my birthday."
369,Phoebe,And you are all so late and you  didn't even have the courtesy to call.
370,Phoebe,"Well, it's too late  now."
371,Ross,"Well, ???"
372,Ross,think that's us?
373,Phoebe,"well, this is, this is, this is not over!"
374,Phoebe,Hello?
375,Joey,"Well, what is going on with you  two?"
376,Monica,"Uch, you see, I'm ovulating."
377,Chandler,"Oh yeah, that's what she says."
378,Chandler,"But maybe you're not  ovulating at all, maybe it's just a clever ruse to get me into bed."
379,Monica,"Yes smokie, that is what it was."
380,Monica,I just can't get enough.
381,Chandler,You not gonna believe
382,Joey,So?
383,Joey,"Did have sex, right?"
384,Chandler,What's the matter with me?
385,Chandler,Why I'm such a girl?
386,Phoebe,"Okay, that was Mike."
387,Rachel,"Phoebe, hi, we're so sorry."
388,Rachel,You're totally right.
389,Rachel,We are here  one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday  celebration.
390,Phoebe,"Mhuh, guys, that means the world to me."
391,Phoebe,"Huh, nkay, I'm gonna  take off."
392,Rachel,What?
393,Phoebe,"Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early."
394,Phoebe,Wait.
395,Phoebe,"Wait, I'm not tnot that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with  her boyfriend."
396,Phoebe,You know what?
397,Phoebe,I am.
398,Phoebe,Bye guys!
399,Phoebe,Judy!
400,Phoebe,Bye.
401,Rachel,"Oh thank god, if Phoebe's going, can we please take Emma  home?"
402,Ross,"You know, I think that's a good ideaour babysitter just pounded  in another Chardonnet."
403,Ross,"Bye, y'guys."
404,Monica,Bye.
405,Joey,See ya.
406,Joey,"Well, this is just us."
407,Joey,Monica &
408,Chandler,Mhum.
409,Monica,"So, I'm, I'm probably still ovulating."
410,Monica,Do you want to give it  another try?
411,Chandler,"So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?"
412,Joey,"Do, do you gonna do it now?"
413,Monica,We don't have much time.
414,Monica,Once the egg descended the oviduct
415,Joey,No-ohoh.
416,Joey,Maitre D'
417,Joey,"Nah, just me."
418,Joey,All alone.
419,Joey,"Dinner for six  for one, uh, you boys are about to see something really special."
