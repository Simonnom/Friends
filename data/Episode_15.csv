96,Ross,"What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?"
97,Rachel,"No-no-no, no, honey please, I've got, I've just have so much to deal with."
98,Phoebe,"Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date?"
99,Phoebe,"So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off."
100,Phoebe,"Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute."

120,Chandler,She was kidding.
121,Joey,Yeah.
122,Chandler,She was....
123,Chandler,"But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules."
124,Joey,"Yeah, for sure."
125,Joey,Okay.
126,Joey,"Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes."
127,Joey,"Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing."
128,Chandler,Yeah.
129,Chandler,"Good call, nice one."
130,Chandler,Hold it!!

138,Chandler,Right.
139,Chandler,"Well ah, y'know we could flip for it."
140,Joey,"Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?"
141,Chandler,"Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you."
142,Rachel,"No, no, no, I'm looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours."
143,Rachel,"And....  What does it matter, what I'm wearing?!"

169,Rachel,What are you doing?
170,Ross,I'm sorry.
171,Ross,"But ah, hey, oh, somebody's off the phone, how bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again."
172,Rachel,"Ross you're not listening to me, I don't have time to stop."
173,Ross,"Come on Rach, you don't have what, ten minutes?"

186,Ross,"No, hey, well, I-I completely understand."
187,Ross,"You were, you were stressed."
188,Rachel,I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
189,Ross,For what?
190,Ross,For letting you throw me out of your office?
191,Rachel,You had no right coming down to my office Ross.
192,Rachel,You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work!
193,Rachel,Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
194,Ross,"Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I."
195,Rachel,"But I told you, I didn't have the time!"
196,Ross,"Yeah, well you never have the time."
197,Ross,"I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel."
198,Rachel,"Wh, Ross what do you want from me?"
199,Rachel,"You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?"
200,Ross,"No, but it'd be nice if you realised, it's just a job!"
201,Rachel,Just a job!
202,Ross,Yes.
203,Rachel,Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about.
204,Rachel,This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at.
205,Rachel,I mean.
206,Rachel,if you don't get that...
207,Ross,"No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time."
208,Ross,"And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine!"
209,Ross,"Okay, I don't know what to do anymore."
210,Rachel,Well neither do I!
211,Ross,Is this about Mark?
212,Rachel,Oh my God.
213,Ross,"Okay, it's not, it's not."
214,Rachel,Oh my God.
215,Rachel,"I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard."
216,Ross,"Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard."
217,Ross,"Okay, what do you want me to do."
218,Rachel,"I don't know, I don't know."
219,Rachel,Urrrgh!
220,Rachel,"Look, maybe we should take a break."
221,Ross,"Okay, okay, fine, you're right."

226,Ross,"Oh, hi Chloe."
227,Chandler,And that's the only colour that comes in.
228,Chandler,"So, what are you doing here?"
229,Chandler,I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
230,Ross,"Yeah, little change in plans."
231,Ross,"Ahh, we're gonna break-up instead."
232,Monica,"Oh, and I can also speak a little French."
233,Monica,Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?
234,Monica,Why?
235,Monica,What did I say?
236,Monica,Oh my God!
237,Monica,No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
238,Phoebe,"Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi."
239,Phoebe,"Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times."
240,Phoebe,You didn't say Boutros Boutros Gali.
241,Phoebe,Interesting.
242,Phoebe,"Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit."
243,Monica,I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
244,Phoebe,"Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please."
245,Phoebe,What are you doing?
246,Monica,"Well, I was having a conversation."
247,Phoebe,"Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other."
248,Monica,What do you want me to do?
249,Monica,Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
250,Phoebe,That would be great.
251,Phoebe,Thank you.
252,Rachel,Hello!
253,Rachel,Oh.
254,Rachel,No!
255,Rachel,"Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else."
256,Rachel,Hi!
257,Rachel,Yeah.
258,Rachel,"Well, umm....."
259,Rachel,"Yeah, I'm fine."
260,Rachel,No!
261,Rachel,"Really, no, please, please, that's, that's okay."
262,Rachel,"Oh, yeah, I'm not, I'm not hungry."
263,Rachel,Oh.
264,Rachel,"Okay, bye."
265,Joey,So what are you gonna do?
266,Ross,What can I do?
267,Ross,"One person wants to break-up, you break-up."
268,Chandler,"Hey, no way!"
269,Chandler,"Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out."
270,Ross,"Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?"
271,Chandler,"Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!"
272,Chandler,Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
273,Joey,"Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny."
274,Chandler,Why?
275,Chandler,What happened to him?
276,Joey,"Nothing, he's just really believes in that."
277,Rachel,"Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight."
278,Rachel,"I just, it was awful."
279,Rachel,"I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break."
280,Rachel,No.
281,Rachel,"And then I called him, and he wasn't there."
282,Rachel,"Oh, thank you that's very helpful, I'm glad you came over."
283,Rachel,Hello.
284,Ross,Hi!
285,Ross,It's me.
286,Rachel,Hi!
287,Rachel,"Oh, I'm so glad you called."
288,Ross,Really?
289,Ross,"I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?"
290,Ross,Who's that?
291,Rachel,Nobody.
292,Ross,Is that Mark?
293,Rachel,"Umm, honey, look he just came over to...."
294,Ross,Yeah!
295,Ross,Got it!
296,Ross,"Ah, that's okay, thanks."
297,Ross,"Look, I don't feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink."
298,Ross,Okay?
299,Monica,Oh.
300,Monica,Can I have a tissue?
301,Phoebe,"Oh, yeah, sure."
302,Phoebe,"I just hope you, hope you don't accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it."
303,Phoebe,"Well, tell him, apology accepted."
304,Phoebe,"Excuse me, but umm, isn't he paying for your dinner?"
305,Monica,"Hey, the man's dog just died."
306,Monica,It will be my pleasure.
307,Monica,My guy has diplomatic coupons.
308,Monica,Your guy can't even say coupons.
309,Phoebe,Plate!
310,Phoebe,"Yes, plate."
311,Phoebe,"See, we don't need them."
312,Phoebe,Yeah.
313,Ross,I like this song.
314,Ross,"Oh, no, no."
315,Rachel,"Oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home."
316,Rachel,Be home.
317,Rachel,"Be home, be home, be home."
318,Rachel,"Oh, you're not home."
319,Phoebe,Ameri-can.
320,Phoebe,Ameri-can.
321,Phoebe,Y'know it's a very hard language.
322,Phoebe,Let's do it again.
