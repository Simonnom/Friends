61,Monica,Have you been here long?
62,Phoebe,It's okay.
63,Phoebe,What the hell took you so long?
64,Monica,"Okay, you can not tell Chandler."
65,Monica,Okay?
66,Monica,That I ran into Richard.
67,Phoebe,Which Richard?
68,Monica,The Richard.
69,Phoebe,Richard Simmons?!
70,Phoebe,Oh my God!
71,Monica,Noo!
72,Monica,My ex-boyfriend Richard!
73,Monica,"Y'know the tall guy, moustache?"
74,Phoebe,Oh!
75,Phoebe,"Okay, that actually makes more sense."
76,Phoebe,So how was it?
77,Monica,"It was, it was really nice."
78,Monica,We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
79,Phoebe,That is so weird!
80,Phoebe,I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
81,Monica,Really?
82,Phoebe,"But again, Simmons."
83,Phoebe,Go on.
84,Monica,"The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!"
85,Phoebe,Ooh!
86,Phoebe,So now why can't we tell Chandler?
87,Monica,Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary.
88,Monica,I just don't want anything to spoil that.
89,Phoebe,"Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!"
90,Monica,I know.
91,Phoebe,Wow!
92,Phoebe,I owe Rachel 20 bucks!
93,Monica,What?
94,Phoebe,On a totally different bet.
95,Chandler,Hey!
96,Monica,It's almost our anniversary!
97,Chandler,I know.
98,Chandler,Can you believe it?
99,Chandler,One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
100,Phoebe,Awww!
101,Phoebe,Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
102,Chandler,Huh.
103,Monica,I got you a present!
104,Chandler,"Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!"
105,Monica,"I know, but you have to open it today!"
106,Chandler,Okay.
107,Monica,Okay!
108,Monica,There you go!
109,Monica,It's two tickets to Vegas!
110,Chandler,Wow!
111,Monica,For this weekend!
112,Monica,"Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane."
113,Monica,We can call it out plane-aversary.
114,Chandler,Do we have to?
115,Monica,No.
116,Chandler,"Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there."
117,Monica,"Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble."
118,Monica,Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him!
119,Monica,"Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary!"
120,Monica,A-Nevadaversary!
121,Chandler,"Yeah, I think we should see other people."
122,Monica,"But we can go, right?"
123,Chandler,Yes.
124,Monica,Okay!
125,Chandler,It's a great idea.
126,Phoebe,"Okay, I'm gonna go too!"
127,Chandler,"Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our  anniversary."
128,Phoebe,"Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London."
129,Monica,Ditch you?
130,Monica,"Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!"
131,Phoebe,"Uh-huh, great story!"
132,Phoebe,I'm going!
133,Rachel,Hi!
134,Phoebe,Hey!
135,Ross,Hey!
136,Phoebe,"Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey!"
137,Phoebe,Including me!!
138,Phoebe,You wanna go?
139,Rachel,"Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work."
140,Phoebe,Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
141,Rachel,"Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow."
142,Rachel,I can't miss that.
143,Ross,"Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit!"
144,Ross,I've been waiting like a year for this.
145,Chandler,Art lover!
146,Ross,What'd you say?
147,Chandler,I said art lover.
148,Ross,Is that supposed to be an insult?
149,Chandler,"I don't know, I'm very tired."
150,Ross,"So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday."
151,Rachel,That sounds great.
152,Ross,Yeah?
153,Ross,All right I'll call the airlines.
154,Rachel,Okay.
155,Rachel,"Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night."
156,Phoebe,"Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked."
157,Rachel,No!
158,Rachel,So I can be by myself.
159,Rachel,Y'know?
160,Rachel,Have a little alone time.
161,Phoebe,Naked alone time.
162,Rachel,No!
163,Rachel,Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked.
164,Rachel,"I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked."
165,Phoebe,Uh-huh!
166,Phoebe,Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
167,Phoebe,"So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?"
168,Chandler,So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
169,Phoebe,"Okay, what about after I give you these candies?"
170,Chandler,"Yeah, I guess it's a little better now."
171,Phoebe,Ah-ha!
172,Phoebe,"Okay,  Las Vegas 1, London 0!"
173,Phoebe,I'll be right back.
174,Chandler,Happy plane-aversary.
175,Monica,Aww!
176,Monica,I love you!
177,Chandler,Can I give you a present now?
178,Monica,Okay!
179,Chandler,Okay!
180,Chandler,Oh man!
181,Chandler,Don't tell me I did this!
182,Monica,"I love the ""I forgot the present"" fake out!"
183,Chandler,"How do you feel about the, ""I really did forgot the present, please forgive me"" not fake out?"
184,Monica,Oh that's okay.
185,Monica,"Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back."
186,Chandler,Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
187,Phoebe,Oh good!
188,Phoebe,"All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing."
189,Chandler,What-what Richard thing?
190,Phoebe,Oh no.
191,Chandler,What Richard thing?
192,Phoebe,Simmons!
193,Phoebe,Go with Simmons!
194,Monica,"Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did."
195,Monica,The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
196,Chandler,I'm not mad.
197,Monica,Really?
198,Chandler,Oh yeah!
199,Chandler,"Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard!"
200,Chandler,You grabbed a bite!
201,Chandler,It's no big deal.
202,Monica,Great!
203,Phoebe,"Okay, London 1"
204,Rachel,Oh!
205,Rachel,Look what happened!
206,Rachel,"{Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up."

215,Ross,I can't look at that!
216,Ross,I am looking at this.
217,Ross,"Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokesUnless she wants me to be looking at that."
218,Ross,She knows I'm home.
219,Ross,She knows I can see her.
220,Ross,What kind of game is she playing?
221,Ross,I think maybe someone's lonely tonight.
222,Ross,"Oh-ho, Dr. Geller!"
223,Ross,Stop it!

241,Ross,This is just about tonight.
242,Ross,"I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of ""Us."""
243,Ross,Okay?
244,Ross,I just want this to be  about what it is!
245,Rachel,"And um, what-what is that Ross?"
246,Ross,The physical act of love.

277,Phoebe,Huh!
278,Monica,"Phoebe, you don't eat animals."
279,Phoebe,"For 99 cents, I'd eat you."
280,Phoebe,"Okay, I can totally settle down here."
281,Phoebe,"It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey!"

295,Joey,I thought I told you not to come.
296,Phoebe,Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
297,Joey,"Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now."
298,Joey,"Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator."

307,Joey,I work here.
308,Chandler,Why?!
309,Chandler,What happened?
310,Joey,"Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does."
311,Monica,I'm so sorry.
312,Joey,"Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya."
313,Joey,I'm sorry man.
314,Chandler,"No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody."
315,Monica,I knew you were not okay with that.
316,Phoebe,So you're a gladiator!
317,Phoebe,Wow!
318,Joey,"Yeah, what-what's going on?"
319,Phoebe,Monica had lunch with Richard.
320,Joey,Dawson?
321,Phoebe,Noo!
322,Phoebe,But that would've been so cool!
323,Chandler,No!
324,Chandler,Her boyfriend Richard!
325,Monica,It meant nothing!
326,Monica,Okay?
327,Monica,"After all this time, how can you not trust me?"
328,Chandler,When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
329,Monica,You're right.
330,Monica,I'm sorry.
331,Monica,I should've told you.
332,Chandler,Thanks.
333,Joey,"Aww, there we go."
334,Phoebe,I love Vegas!
335,Monica,"I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you."
336,Chandler,Next time?
337,Joey,"Ooh, so close."
338,Chandler,There's not gonna be a next time!
339,Chandler,You can not ever see him again!
340,Monica,I can not see him?
341,Monica,"I mean, you can't tell me what to do!"
342,Chandler,"That's so funny, because I think I just did!"
343,Monica,Oh y'know what?
344,Monica,"If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you."
345,Chandler,Fine with me!
346,Monica,Fine!
347,Monica,Happy Anniversary!
348,Joey,Whoa!

350,Joey,Guys!
351,Joey,Please!
352,Joey,Come on!

355,Monica,No it is not!
356,Chandler,What are you talking
357,Joey,Hey-hey don't look at me!
358,Joey,I just work here!
359,Rachel,"Okay umm, Ross?"
360,Rachel,"I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater."
361,Rachel,"Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love."
362,Ross,Yep!
363,Ross,That's hilarious!
364,Rachel,I'm sorry.
365,Rachel,I'm done.
366,Rachel,I'm done.
367,Ross,"Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too."
368,Rachel,"No, not really."
369,Rachel,I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
370,Ross,Uh-huh.
371,Ross,But it was a first for the rest of my building.
372,Rachel,Okay.
373,Rachel,"All right, that's true!"
374,Rachel,But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
375,Ross,What?!
376,Ross,You totally get embarrassed!
377,Rachel,"No, I don't!"
378,Rachel,"Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are."
379,Ross,Is that so?
380,Rachel,Yeah.
381,Ross,Hey lady!
382,Ross,I don't care how much you want it!
383,Ross,Okay?!
384,Ross,I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom!
385,Joey,"Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat."
386,Chandler,Really?
387,Joey,"Yeah, sure!"
388,Joey,Sure!
389,Joey,"They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it!"
390,Joey,They would use it to get the mud off their shoe.
391,Joey,And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right
392,Chandler,"Joey, I uh!"
393,Chandler,I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
394,Joey,"All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then."
395,Joey,Look!
396,Joey,A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
397,Chandler,Whoa!
398,Joey,"Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000."
399,Joey,Can you believe that?
400,Joey,"$5,000!"
401,Chandler,"Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!"
402,Joey,Wait a minute!
403,Joey,Why don't I do what that guy did?
404,Joey,"I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000!"
405,Joey,And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
406,Chandler,Good luck!
407,Joey,Chandler!
408,Joey,I don't need luck.
409,Joey,I have thought this through!
410,Chandler,I see.
411,Chandler,Commercial Break
412,Monica,Thank you.
413,Phoebe,Thanks.
414,Monica,I can't believe this!
415,Monica,This is like the worst night ever!
416,Phoebe,Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler.
417,Phoebe,Big deal!
418,Phoebe,It's only Chandler.
419,Phoebe,I am so sorry.
420,Monica,This is crazy!
421,Monica,"I mean, it's such a stupid argument."
422,Monica,I don't even wanna see Richard again.
423,Phoebe,So go fix it!
424,Phoebe,Go find Chandler!
425,Phoebe,He's probably up in your room!
426,Phoebe,Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
427,Monica,Y'know what?
428,Monica,You're right Phoebe.
429,Monica,You're right.

463,Chandler,What?
464,Joey,My identical hand twin!
465,Chandler,What's an identical hand twin?
466,Joey,What's it sound like?
467,Joey,It's a guy with my identical hands!
468,Joey,It was incredible!
469,Joey,"Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me!"
470,Joey,It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
471,Chandler,Are you sure you weren't  looking at your hands in a mirror?
472,Joey,Don't you see what this means?!
473,Joey,I can forget about that stupid movie.
474,Joey,I'm gonna be a millionaire!
475,Chandler,How?
476,Joey,"Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money!"
477,Joey,Come on!
478,Joey,Identical hands!
479,Chandler,"Again I must go back to, how?"
480,Joey,This is Vegas man!
481,Joey,People will pay to see freaky stuff!
482,Joey,"Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand  twice?"
483,Joey,Huh?
484,Chandler,"Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe."
485,Joey,"Hey, are you unsupporting me again?"
486,Chandler,No!
487,Chandler,No!
488,Chandler,I support you 100%!
489,Chandler,"I just didn't, I didn't get it right away."
490,Chandler,Y'know now I'm caught up!
491,Chandler,Identical hand twins!
492,Chandler,It's a million-dollar idea!
493,Phoebe,Hey!
494,Joey,Pheebs!
495,Phoebe,Yeah?
496,Joey,I found my identical hand twin!
497,Phoebe,"Ohh, you are so lucky!"
498,Phoebe,Hey!
499,Phoebe,"So, where's Monica?"
500,Phoebe,Did you guys make up?
501,Chandler,No!
502,Phoebe,But she just came up here!
503,Chandler,That was Joey!
504,Phoebe,I wonder where she is.
505,Phoebe,That is so weird.
506,Chandler,"Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard."
507,Phoebe,Would you stop that!
